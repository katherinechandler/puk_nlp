Nice ride.

It's a good way to see Beirut.

28
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:49,869
This is very similar to that
place we went to years ago.

29
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:57,870
This is your traditional
chicken sandwich.

30
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,584
The roasted chicken was this
man's idea, Ramsey Short who I

31
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,254
met in the bad old days of 2006.

32
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:12,559
Apparently he's in with the
Lebanese chapter of the Harley

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,262
Davidson group,
or hog for short.

34
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:19,999
So when you roll into some
religiously conservative

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,570
villages on the bikes and
leather jackets what is the

36
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:23,837
reaction?

37
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,805
Two types.

38
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,574
Once we were pelted with rice

39
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,642
and the other extreme was stones

40
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,911
at the wheels like
just get out of here.

41
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:36,316
I wouldn't throw stones
at people on Harleys.

42
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:36,517
Whoa.

43
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:37,417
Look at this.

44
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:43,089
Let's dig in.

45
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,426
This is a famous neighborhood.

46
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:49,496
This area was central
during the civil war.

47
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:53,833
The sheer volume of fire that
was poured into some of these

48
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,636
buildings is absolutely
unbelievable.

49
00:03:56,637 --> 00:04:01,040
So many have been in the same
place over and over and over

50
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:01,275
again.

51
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:02,041
Clearly.

52
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:06,012
I notice this every time
someone visiting the city they

53
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,314
just point at that.

54
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,381
Look at that.

55
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,817
But you know, we don't
see them any many.

56
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:18,818
Just pass by them.

57
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:27,667
Beirut, seemingly the
world in literature.

58
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,637
18 religious sects recognized.

59
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:34,407
More than 2 million Christians,
over a million and a half

60
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:39,979
Shiites, a million and a half
Sunni and 500,000 Palestinians

61
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,319
and now as many as 2 million
Syrians, all living and somehow

62
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,688
getting along, kind of, in a

63
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:53,159
country the size of Connecticut.

64
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,065
But along its borders the
country has what you might call

65
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,833
serious neighbor issues.

66
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:05,338
Isis in Syria threatening
to expand into Lebanon.

67
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:09,942

we have never really

68
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,712

well equipped terrorist army.

70
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,553
The country simply
can't take any more.

71
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:25,525
A quarter of Lebanon's
population is now Syrian.

72
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:31,698
That is the equivalent of the U.S.
taking in 83 million

73
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:31,965
Syrians.

74
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:36,736
The real fear is that
violence cross the border now

75
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:44,477
spilling into an
already fragile area.

76
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,948

Close to 2 million
people from Syria alone.

114
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:01,642
Yeah.

115
00:09:01,643 --> 00:09:06,613
That's a hell of a lot to be
absorbed by a tiny little

116

nation.

117
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:09,849
It's just loads of people

Needles to say he had at one
time a better life back there.

126
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,286
I came from Syria.

127
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,389
After the civil war
started... yeah.

128
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,158
Many, many problems.

129
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,626
Sectarian problems and we don't

130
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:57,163
want to add more problems
for those people.

131
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,799
But what can we do?

132
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,900
We live here.

133
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,469
Imagine the situation here.

134
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:11,470
It is unbelievable.

135
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:21,688
He is there by the way
and he has three kids.

136
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:27,059
He works construction.

137
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:35,060
His family bought this to
protect from the rats.

138
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,772
These children need medical
operation but this family can't

139
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,041
pay for those operation.

140
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:46,545
It is expensive.

141
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,747
They wait for nothing.

142
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,549
They wait for the hand of god.

143
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,251
Straining under the weight of

144
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:56,455
all of these unasked for guests
the Lebanese government has

145
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,025
begun making it very
difficult for them.

146
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,228
He doesn't work because he
doesn't have an official

147
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:05,264
resident so he can't
leave the camp.

148
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,066
Otherwise he will be homeless.

149
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:11,137
Being stopped at any of the
military check points could mean

150
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,873
a one way ticket back to Syria,

151
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:20,146
trapped, unable to work, they
exist invisibly on the margins

152
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,313
of society.

153
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,415
This is military.

154
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:31,416
You don't want to get
involved in any problem.

155
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:38,130
Syrian food, it is
called the seven countries.

156
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:42,301
It consists of many
kinds of vegetables.

157
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:50,276
Seven kinds of fruit.

158
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:56,115
Most of them are doctors,
engineers, lawyers, teachers.

159
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,917
Here now it's the opposite.

160
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:05,257
Here in Lebanon even if you
were a doctor or a lawyer or a

161
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,027
teacher, you can't
work only in the camp.

162
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:13,265
We don't know how to go, where
to go, to go back to Syria.

163
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,000
No can do.

164
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,601
To cross the sea.

165
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,003
Yeah.

166
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:21,507
Suppose that there is authority
to collect us to throw

167
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:24,610
us away to Syria,
what will we do?

168
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,379
We have no area in the world.

169
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,049
We have no place
in this universe.

170
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,618
We belong to nowhere.

171
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,588
Nowhere.

172
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:06,152
Once known as the Paris of the
middle east, Beirut still

173
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:10,923
clings to its glamorous 1960s
image where you could famously

174
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:17,029
ski and go to the beach
all in the same day.

175
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,398
Walking it's easy to forget, for

176
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:27,399
a moment anyway, what's
going on not far from here.

177
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:02,274
All the people who
live here feel safe.

178
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:06,913
They expand outside of their
houses and this is one of their

179
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:07,214
traditions.

180
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:09,215
This is how I live my life.

181
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,952
Mo is a local security
specialist on assignment to

182
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,654
keep, well, me and my
crew safe from harm.

183
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,558
He lives with his daughter and
family in Beirut, a mixed

184
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,829
neighborhood of Christians,
Muslims and Jews were a little

185
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,630
oil in the middle?

186
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:24,898
Yes.

187
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:25,443
So good.

188
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,811
Very good fish.

189
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,247
I missed this country.

190
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,248
I really did.

191
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,083
You have been here before?

192
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,585
This is my third time.

193
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,920
My first time was 2006.

194
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,122
We came here and had two perfect

195
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,958
days and then the war broke out.

196
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,662
During my first trip here in

197
00:14:56,663 --> 00:15:04,170
2006, Hezbollah had a 44 day war

198
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:08,340
that followed and much of Beirut

199
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:14,280
was heavily pounded by bombs
and artilleries.

200
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,283
You have this really
extraordinary mix of religions

201
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,284
and people.

202
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,451
What's so special?

203
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:19,952
Why?

204
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:24,490
Of course, somebody on Friday
going pray, somebody on Sunday

205
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,792
going pray.

206
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,327
They go the same restaurant and

207
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,297
have the same food and they
have the same traditions.

208
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,732
There is no place
better than Lebanon.

209
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:34,533
You have everything.

210
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,402
People are friendly.

211
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,003
Beautiful, fantastic.

212
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,638
It is a democracy here.

213
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,239
Of course.

214
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,642
You have choice to sit down.

215
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,810
I like this.

216
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,712
I don't like this.

217
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:51,250
So what's it look like now?

218
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:55,921
We looked like before 2006.

219
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,324
That's not good.

220
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:02,494
Tension is a little bit high
but the people, we are very

221
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:02,762
happy.

222
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,496
I go with my family.

223
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:09,335
I was watching the news last
night in the hotel and it is

224
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,403

Not really.

less optimistic?

Yeah.

363
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,749
Most of the villages in
eastern Lebanon, they are

364
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,618
Christian and they are Sunni.

365
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,418
Correct.

366
00:25:53,419 --> 00:26:00,191
If Hezbollah wasn't there, it
was Christian in that area.

367
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,761
This is the only reason, this is

368
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:06,264
the only reason just to protect
my children and my wife.

369
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,833
20 years, 30 years?

370
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,434
Yeah.

371
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:10,836
Will things be better?

372
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:14,005
I hope so.

373
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:19,177
That many years, now, next year.

374
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,147
I hate war.

375
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,200
♪

376
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:29,347
Who is buying these apartments?

377
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,282
Two kinds of people.

378
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:36,087
Lebanese who are living abroad
or Arabs especially from the

379
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,189
Gulf region.

380
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,228
For whom Beirut is a wonderland.

381
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,563
Compared to where they are yes.

382
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:50,769
But we cannot generalize this
and say that Beirut is a place

383
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,071
where sexual expression
is encouraged.

384
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:57,909
Her books are banned in many
countries in the region.

385
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:02,147
She is regularly threatened
the rape, stoning and murder.

386
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:06,551
She is culture editor of
Lebanon's biggest newspaper.

387
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:11,256
Yesterday I had my first TV
show about sexual freedom and

388
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:17,162
you cannot imagine how many doors
have opened just because I

389
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:20,732
dare said that girls are
allowed sexuality like boys.

390
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:26,237
We pretend to be a democracy.

391
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,574
This is yogurt sauce
and Cranberries.

392
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:30,909
Fried.

393
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,012
Stuffed grape please.

394
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:34,446
Yes.

395
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:38,516
The fact that Lebanon and
Beirut works at all.

396
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:43,088
If all of these religious
groups, this is a fully

397
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:46,858
functioning more or less
by world standards.

398
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,760
We don't have a president.

399
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:51,997
It's going to be a year now
that we are without one.

400
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:53,698
It's sort of awesome.

401
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,266
Don't you think that the main

402
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:58,003
reason behind you seeing this as

403
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,437
thrilling, exciting place to

404
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:02,173
live in is that you're a visitor

405
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:06,111
and not someone who
actually lives here?

406
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:07,879
Am I wrong to love this place?

407
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,681
You're not wrong to love it.

408
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:14,685
I love living on the tip of a
volcano, but there has to be

409
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,122
some point where I can
breathe and relax.

410
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:21,392
I don't want to seem like I'm
only criticizing because I

411
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,529
really also as much as I hate
this place, I love it as well.

412
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:32,530
And I know that it's very
precious to have such a freedom

413
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,572
in a place like Beirut.

414
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,843
I don't need to tell you about

415
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:39,710
Islamic states even though they

416
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,348
are not inside Beirut yet,
we can feel it every day.

417
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:44,649
Should people come here?

418
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,084
Yes, definitely.

419
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:46,818
They should come.

420
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:52,523
They will enjoy it
as much as you have.

421
00:29:52,524 --> 00:30:00,524
I wouldn't advise them to stay
more than a month, though.

422
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:06,097
I often go to events and I
asked him to call me your

423
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:06,398
highness.

424
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,266
I love it.

425
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:12,070
I go there and I dress
like an emperor.

426
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:14,572
Sometimes I dress
like an emperor.

427
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,807
There have been two
attempts on your life?

428
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:17,475
Yes.

429
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:20,311
That you're aware of.

430
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:24,815
It means the third one succeeds.

431
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:28,586
I don't know when the
third one will be.

432
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:31,089
An activist, a labor organizer.

433
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,991
You have been arrested
in your life?

434
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,625
Yes, many times.

435
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,195
When I was 14 years old I became

436
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:39,797
a communist in a region that was

437
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:43,534
under control of the extreme
right wing militia.

438
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:49,440
I ended up in a torture room.

439
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:54,612
Later after joining and then
leaving the Lebanese army,

440
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:59,317
Michelle formed the NRU, an
armed revolutionary group.

441
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,686
Your life now is
music and culture?

442
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:05,623
I think that I was made to
be a musician but when war

443
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,125
happened, I took a gun.

444
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:12,230
I understood that I could not
face someone who was attacking

445
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:16,201
my house with a guitar.

446
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:21,206
In 2003, by now a music
producer, entrepreneur,

447
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:25,476
politician, artist and film
maker, he founded the Beirut

448
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:29,147
musical in a bullet popped
theater empty since the civil

449
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:29,381
war.

450
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:30,848
This is his kingdom.

451
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,684
Some people come
because it's trendy.

452
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,221
They come with sexy ladies.

453
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:41,059
Some come because they like
to discover new things.

454
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,595
We have up to 15 acts, each act

455
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,231
coming from a different culture.

456
00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:48,266
Who needs culture?

457
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:56,267
I think that culture
can save the world.

458
00:32:56,375 --> 00:33:00,211
Someone who had looks, someone
to listen to beautiful music

459
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,680
cannot become an animal again.

460
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:07,385
If you were the emperor of
the world, hypothetically.

461
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:07,918
Hopefully.

462
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,422
Hopefully, what would Beirut
be like in ten years?

463
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:18,029
Best case scenario it goes
back to before the creation of

464
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,297
separate.

465
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:20,631
When all communities were
living together well.

466
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,867
We would have a Jewish
neighborhood here.

467
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:27,605
I think we would have to be
united to fight the monster,

468
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:28,206
Isis.

469
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:30,741
Once the monster is defeated you

470
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,712
can start arguing again
about other things.

471
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,176
How you doing?

472
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,110
I'm Tony?

473
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:41,379
This feels very formal.

474
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,780
Yes.

475
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:44,115
But it's not so please relax.

476
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,616
I am relaxed.

477
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,152
Can I get my beer.

478
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:50,855
By all means, yes please.

479
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:53,124
Lots of people come here.

480
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:57,895
They are mostly musicians
and sick people.

481
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,464
Lots of jamming here and it's

482
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,799
like we're a family hanging out.

483
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,137
This cafe is a typical Beirut

484
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:09,140
establishment from Syria and
any number of other countries.

485
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:12,210
The owners are both Lebanese and

486
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:14,312
Syrian and acutely aware of the

487
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,348
tricky political realities
with which they must live.

488
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,484
They were concerned about us filming

489
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:21,819
here and wanted us to understand

490
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,423
clearly that the cafe has no
political affiliation and that

491
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:27,258
the opinions of this young lady

492
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:32,163
are not that of the cafe or
even that of the clientele.

493
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,499
You are born and bred sue knee?

494
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,433
Yes.

495
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:39,504
I was born and brought
up in Syria, Damascus.

496
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:42,940
The army entered our house and
I found them in our bedroom

497
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:48,679
looking for the free
Syrian army.

498
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,950
My dad knew he couldn't protect
us because he was old.

499
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:59,023
Three hours later we decided to
leave, so we came to Beirut.

500
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,391
We always eat here.

501
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:08,392
Grape leaves are my and I
have four months left and

502
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:18,075
I have no idea what to do.

503
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:22,079
What do you think, will
they renew your visa?

504
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,049
So far, I don't think so.

505
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:28,719
And do they the arrest you?

506
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,387
Do they take you to the border

507
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,221
and kick you over
to the other side?

508
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:30,888
They send you back to Syria.

509
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,757
What happens if you
go back to Syria?

510
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,792
Most probably die.

511
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:42,233
On the way or to some people get
arrested or be taken to the

512
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:42,434
army.

513
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:43,601
How different is
Damascus from Beirut?

514
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:49,407
Oh, it is really, really
different, and in Damascus, I

515
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,108
was always afraid of the
government, and some people died

516
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,010
because they cursed
the president.

517
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:59,183
I left Syria, and I found hope
here, and I screamed in the

518
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:02,487
streets cursing all of the
politicians, and everything.

519
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:09,126
It is all right, nobody is
going to come to arrest you.

520
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,127
I really love this place
with all of my heart.

521
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:16,133
Is all of the chaos and the
violence worth it for change?

522
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:16,767
It is is worth dying for?

523
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:23,040
I mean, things were, there was
order when you grew up, there

524
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:23,309
was order?

525
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:23,609
Yes.

526
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,442
No freedom, but order.

527
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:27,378
Would you go back to that?

528
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:32,950
I don't think that there's
anything worthy in the world of

529
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,519
a human blood.

530
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,389
There is nothing more
important than human being.

531
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,958
You have never been able to
yell out loud, and you have

532
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,027
never been able to do the things

533
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:45,630
that you could do right
now, you would go back?

534
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:46,230
I was alive.

535
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,666
A lot of people were alive, too.

536
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,637
♪

537
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:20,731
During the day, widespread
shocking bombing and widespread

538
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:21,166
finger pointing.

539
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:26,237
This has set off a tide of
unrest and civil unrest.

540
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:49,186
For capitalists like
myself and Ramsey.

541
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:57,034
It is a communist-themed bar.

542
00:38:57,035 --> 00:39:00,538
What is this?

543
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:02,540
I don't know, it is
put in front of us.

544
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:08,713
Well, we should drink it and
not try to figure it out.

545
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:09,313
Oh, with well.

546
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:10,247
Vodka.

547
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,582
Vodka.

548
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,217
I had somebody who lives here

549
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:17,722
tell me, oh, this place is very

550
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:18,355
good, and stay the here longer.

551
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,492
And I was like, what?

552
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:22,126
You are trying to kill us, man.

553
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:22,561
Who is this man?

554
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:23,293
Yeah, yeah.

555
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,295
He is trying to hurt us.

556
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,133
Cheers.

557
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:35,272
And after a more than a few
indigenous beverages, and now we

558
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:35,607
are talking.

559
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:35,907
Cheers.

560
00:39:35,908 --> 00:39:37,642
Enter Ernesto.

561
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:41,779
Hey, hey.

562
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,413
I have something for you.

563
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:42,781
Yeah, yeah.

564
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:43,281
It is a Cuban cigar.

565
00:39:43,282 --> 00:39:51,282
And in the words of Vladimir
Illitch Lennon, let's get this

566
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:57,429
party started.

567
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,997
My mom, she made some cheese,

568
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,768
and it is the kind of
the rotten cheese.

569
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:04,002
Oh.

570
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:08,272
I called my dad and I said, there
is a dad called Tony, CNN,

571
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:13,444
and he said, I don't watch CNN
and I said, but he is a cool

572
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:13,612
guy.

573
00:40:13,613 --> 00:40:21,613
He wants to make the
best food for you.

574
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:23,287
This is someone that
I know in Beirut.

575
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:23,821
It is lamb and spices.

576
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:24,122
Oh, man.

577
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:28,694
That is good.

578
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,128
Are we picking up a gun or not?

579
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:34,364
They will fight these people.

580
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:38,402
Oh, no, we have to have it.

581
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:42,907
I seem to remember mom at
some point pulling out a some

582
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:43,974
kind of automatic weapon.

583
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:46,977
I will take it up in
arms, and I will fight.

584
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:51,081
Let me tell you about it.

585
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:59,082
And then Bootsy Collins came
over the intercom system, and

586
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:07,865
the rest dissolved into a fog.

587
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,767
It is am amazing
that it persists.

588
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:14,004
And I have been a number of

589
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,172
places, and this the place,
it is the world's finest.

590
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:16,907
I think so, too.

591
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:24,908
Here is to Tony, man.

592
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:37,695
Beirut... everybody
should come here.

593
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:39,196
Everybody should see how
complicated and deeply trouble

594
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,966
and yet at the same time how
beautiful and awesome the world

595
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:42,867
can be.

596
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:46,637
Everyone should experience even

597
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,206
as the clouds gather what's
at stake, what could be lost,

598
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:57,207
what's still here and
never let that hope go.

599
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:02,788
Beirut, there is
no place like it.
