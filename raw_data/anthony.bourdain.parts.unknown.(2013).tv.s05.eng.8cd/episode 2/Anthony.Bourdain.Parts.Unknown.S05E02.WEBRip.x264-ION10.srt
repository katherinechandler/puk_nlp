During world war ii, Miami

133
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:16,422
saw a massive influx
of military personnel.

134
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,357
Hotels, which had seen a sharp

135
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,026
drop in business, made a deal

136

with the government to house
troops in empty resorts.

137
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,934
Parents came down, sons came

138
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:28,535
down, they opened businesses

139
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:29,869
here, and they were basically

Jewish at the time and
that's how it started.

infinitely expanding real

there's water and you've got

00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:58,926
property.

164
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:04,263
Or as in coral gables,
a new Venice.

165
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:10,536
Gone Doe last to ferry the new

seekers to their
palatzos in the sun.

167
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:20,546
The dream was as
expandable as the space.

168
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,381
Where there was water, there was

169
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:30,382
now magically Terra
sort a firma.

170
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:37,629
And in the 80s where there was

171
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,602
decline, a vacuum, suddenly
there was a new and vibrant

172
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:49,809
economy one that raised all
boats, shiny cars, swanky

173
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,243
nightclubs, and a new reputation

174
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:56,115
for murder and criminality
to go with it.

175
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:56,583
Cocaine.

176
00:11:56,584 --> 00:12:02,822
Say what you will, cocaine

00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:03,056

178
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:06,658
It made, for better or
worse, Miami sexy again.

179
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:11,798
Going back to the very
beginning, was Miami always a

180
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,000
criminal enterprise?

181
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:18,871
But I mean that in a good way.

182
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,041
Outlaw culturism a very deep
part of American culture.

183
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:25,544
We don't produce or manufacture
anything but oranges

184
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,013
or handguns.

185
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,047
We sell sunshine.

186
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,682
The only jobs we have are in

187
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:35,554
hospitality or in restaurants.

188
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:35,956
Real estate.

189
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:36,323
Real estate.

190
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:38,724
It is all to sell the
dream to the next people.

191
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:43,695
In 1981 the FBI called Miami
the most violent city in

192
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:43,931
America.

193
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:49,335
The drug industry brought in an

194
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,737
estimated to 7 to $12 billion a

195
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,906
year and that was of 1981 Miami.

196
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,075
That is a lot of trickle down.

197
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,810
One of the most successful

198
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:04,083
documentaries in the history of

199
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,919
film is "cocaine cowboys"
that tells that story.

200
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,389
So things were in decline.

201
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,425
Cocaine sort of saved the city?

202
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,493
We'd say so.

203
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:18,230
Am I going to get
in trouble for it?

204
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:18,498
Yes.

205
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,732
You had a murder rate.

206
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:25,571
25% of those bodies had
automatic weapons bullets.

207
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:29,541
We talk about the uncomfortable
reality of where a

208
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,678
lot of the modern Miami came

209
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,381
from over something you just

210
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:42,788
have to hit hard in
Miami when in season.

211
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,223
Stone crabs.

212
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:48,460
Federal reserve branch in
Miami had a $5 billion cash

213
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:48,795
surplus.

214
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:52,731
Mostly 50s and 100 dollar bills

215
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,034
all of which had trace
elements of cocaine on them.

216
00:13:55,035 --> 00:14:02,241
And the guys in cocaine
trafficking got out and are now

217
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,642
big medicare fraudsters.

218
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:08,414
We're whispering because
they're probably here.

219
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,216
So where's the money now?

220
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,283
How's business in general in

221
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:15,821
Miami and where is that
business coming from?

222
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,490
Remarkably the rebound from

223
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,792
the great recession, the people

224
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,428
thought it would take a decade

225
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,397
and it seemed to happen
almost overnight.

226
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:30,002
We're in the middle
of another huge boom.

227
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,837
Who is buying?

228
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,606
Wealthy foreigners.

229
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:40,146
A lot of capital Russians.

230
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:45,184
If it is money looted from
another country, do we care?

231
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:53,185
The question is how
long will it last?

232
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,198
There's history and there's

233
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,871
the more immediate
needs of the present.

234
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:09,508
I need food presently and
perhaps some fine bourbon and

235
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,944
when I need good food in a city

236
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,180
not my own, more and more these

237
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,215
days I call somebody if they

238
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,450
weren't good at enough things

239
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,120
already has become something of

240
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,555
an expert on food
around the world.

241
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,724
Every time I check Instagram

242
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:33,725
you're eating with one
of my culinary heros.

243
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,734
I'm here.

244
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,836
You've been to
this place before?

245
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,172
I live at this place.

246
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,574
Really?

247
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:43,842
Yeah.

248
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:49,581
Yard bird quickly became
a Miami favorite.

249
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,517
The old joke was James brown

250
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,920
was the hardest working
man in show business.

251
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,888
You make him look lazy.

252
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,724
Producer, a teacher.

253
00:15:58,725 --> 00:15:59,559
Yep.

254
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,327
A D.J.

255
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:05,597
Technically, I have
16 jobs right now.

256
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,101
Devilled eggs with fresh dill

257
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:14,406
and trout roll will be so over

258
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,676
next year, but right
now I want more.

259
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:20,112
Fried beans with pork belly.

260
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,347
This is the perfect thing for a

261
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:25,051
guy looking to squeeze into a

262
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:28,120
size 28 Speedo tomorrow
and hit the beach.

263
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:33,259
What makes the Miami sound
different from the Detroit

264
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,294
sound, the Philadelphia sound,

265
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,597
the New York sound, whatever?

266
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,432
You can't say Philadelphia

267
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:47,139
has strings in their arrangement

268
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,609
whereas records had
organ in there.

269
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:57,416
What's called 77 Elvis pancakes?

270
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:01,120
Chocolate chip pancakes, bourbon

271
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:09,121
maple syrup, banana compote.

272
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,137
Yard bird's signature fried
chicken comes with spiced

273
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,073
watermelon and cheddar
cheese waffles.

274
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:26,112
They brine the chicken
17 hours to be exact.

275
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,947
Tender inside and perfectly
crispy on the outside.

276
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:34,586
To me, I like waffles and I
like chicken, but I don't

277
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,821
understand waffles and
chicken together.

278
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,023
You still don't understand?

279
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,491
I understand people deeply

280
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,427
love them and I do like waffles

281
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:44,530
and I do like fried chicken.

282
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,598
Put them on separate
plates and I'm okay.

283
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,502
You don't want your
food integrated?

284
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:58,177
Shrimp and grits, a
Southern classic.

285
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,945
I was reading your book.

286
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,982
Is it Curtis Mayfield you
have bad associations with?

287
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:11,983
Whenever I hear Curtis
Mayfield, just as a kid, that

288
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:16,562
particular structure
always frightened me.

289
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:17,563
Even now?

290
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,899
I'm angry that that
band ever existed.

291
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,837
I hate that old englishy, old,

292
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:32,211
bar minstrel, stand on one
leg mother [ Muted ] shit.

293
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:36,315
You never know when you play

294
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:39,418
music were they molested by a

295
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,086
rodeo clown to that song and

296
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,123
Jethro Tull is my
version of that.

297
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,735
Who got here first?

298
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,104
Who other than say some early

299
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,708
native American
tribes and Spaniards?

300
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,311
Caribbean blacks, Bahamian.

301
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:19,925
Henry Morrison flagger, the

302
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,294
tycoon largely credited with big

303
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,029
the father of modern Florida.

304
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,433
His dream was the Florida east

305
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,967
coast railroad, which would run

306
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,603
from Jacksonville to key west

307
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,305
connecting the ports of Miami to

308
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,207
the rail system of the rest of

309
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,809
the United States, creating

310
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:43,782
along its route new towns,
new cities, new places where

311
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:50,622
America's rising middle class
could frolic and play.

312
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,459
As more and more whites moved

313
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,896
in, segregation took hold and

314
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,665
much of the community was forced

315
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:05,103
into the black neighborhoods
like Overtown.

316
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,639
If you're looking for old Miami,

317
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,345
original Miami, you're looking

318
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:20,085
to an extent for black Miami.

319
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:28,086
♪

320
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,031
These days Liberty city is

321
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:36,101
mostly ignored by developers,

322
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:40,339
but back in the day it was
the epicenter of the black

323
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,207
community.

324
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:49,208
A lot has happened since then.

325
00:20:52,852 --> 00:21:00,158
Pancakes, smoked
sausage, boiled eggs.

326
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,228
What do you usually get?

327
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,196
The fishy grits.

328
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:11,870
Your parents were
Jamaican and Bahamian.

329
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:12,805
Yes.

330
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:16,375
Today I'm having fish and
grits at milk restaurant with

331
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,043
this guy, Luther Campbell.

332
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,879
A lot of good cooking
tradition in the family.

333
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,683
Oh, yeah.

334
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:27,319
One night we'd have
peas and rice.

335
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,657
The other night we'd
have rice and peas.

336
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:35,260
Otherwise known as
Luke sky Walker.

337
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,397
He is something of a musical and

338
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,531
political and legal legend.

339
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:47,532
Maybe you know him from
Campbell versus Rose music.

340
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:56,882
How do you end up different

341
00:21:56,883 --> 00:22:00,285
growing up in Miami than you

342
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,621
would have grown up in L.A.
and New York?

343
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:08,293
A lot of people would have

344
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:14,032
said Southern people, whatever
you want to call us, in

345
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:20,472
actuality we're a Bahaman town.

346
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:25,544
Very, very different.

347
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:32,050
How has that mix, how has
that impacted the music?

348
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,219
When people think about me,

349
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,122
this guy makes bootie
shaking music.

350
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,991
Everybody is dancing
in a sexual way.

351
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:43,795
The girls are
standing up on you.

352
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:48,500
The girls stand up on you
and put your butt on you.

353
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,837
I've seen this on television.

354
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:59,838
It's no different
than a lap dance.

355
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,347
You ran for office?

356
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,650
Yeah.

357
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:09,187
About 70% residents of Miami
speak Spanish at home.

358
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:12,524
Uh-huh.

359
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:18,530
Enormous African-American
and Caribbean community.

360
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:23,334
How come they keep electing
conservative white guys?

361
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,370
You have a whole
quiet community.

362
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,606
You didn't get them
excited about voting.

363
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:31,477
It is the opposite of get
out the vote program.

364
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:33,111
It is don't bother to vote.

365
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,180
Don't bother to vote.

366
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,848
African-Americans voted at 20%.

367
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:41,219
If we would have voted at 50%,

368
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,221
Charlotte Gris would have
won the governor's race.

369
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,390
If you were selling Miami to

370
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,459
somebody, what's the
best thing about Miami?

371
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,227
Best weather.

372
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:50,896
How do you handle the cold if

373
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:54,633
you have to tour or something in

374
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,067
Detroit or Chicago or something?

375
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,904
My mind-set is I don't have

376
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:02,541
to deal with this every day.

377
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,109
I'm going back to sunshine.

378
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,410
I can go into a blizzard.

379
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,879
I know I'm going out.

380
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,481
Y'all stay.

381
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:11,850
This is really good.

382
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:15,687
Back inland, another
world of flavors.

383
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:16,988
Little Haiti.

384
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:22,060
Just in case Miami didn't
have enough tasty stuff from

385
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:22,562
elsewhere.

386
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:29,167
The band market is
tucked away in the back.

387
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:32,270
They serve some of the dishes

388
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:35,173
they make me happiest, jerk

389
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:38,710
chicken, who doesn't love that?

390
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:39,211
Cow-foot soup.

391
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:45,617
That looks, by the
way, unbelievable.

392
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:46,418
That's so good.

393
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:47,919
What's the best
thing about Miami?

394
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,556
The mix of cultures.

395
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,090
What's the worst thing?

396
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:55,794
You know what really
pisses me off?

397
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:59,297
I walk down the street and I say

398
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:02,801
hi to people and I don't
get a hi back a lot here.

399
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,970
To what do you attribute this?

400
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:07,573
The transient part of it.

401
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:11,042
People don't feel rooted.

402
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,979
They are from south
America, central America.

403
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,615
Their whole plan is to come here

404
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:21,887
do what they can to send money

405
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,923
to their family to live in the

406
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:30,328
home of their dreams
and then go back.

407
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:30,930
If I were to think about

408
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:33,665
coming to Florida to live, what

409
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,066
would seem attractive to me,

410
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:43,067
find some place on the beach
and just sink in until my

411
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,344
liver-spotted George Hamilton

412
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:50,849
face, walk up and down metal

413
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,150
detecter, that would be me.

414
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:58,657
People who go to live that
dream, they don't go to the

415
00:25:58,658 --> 00:25:58,858
beach.

416
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:02,260
Ask me when the last time
I went to the beach was.

417
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:05,631
When was the last time
I went to the beach.

418
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:08,767
About a year and a half ago.

419
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,670
What the [ Muted ] is that?

420
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:12,605
We're working.

421
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:16,341
I love it and I always say I

422
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,209
will never live in south Florida

423
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,946
if I didn't live near water.

424
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:23,682
I live near water and I leave my

425
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:26,384
doors open a lot, but I
don't go to the beach.

426
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:31,022
I barely even go into my
swimming pool, but I know it's

427
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:31,223
there.

428
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:34,193

before "Miami vice" before

435
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:08,827
the Miami sound machine,
there was a Miami sound.

436
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,429
The music, the original Miami

437
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,432
sound we're talking about, came

438
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:18,704
from this man, Willie
Clark and this space.

439
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:22,140
What was this space originally?

440
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:22,775
This was a little restaurant

441
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,275
smaller than this and we were on

442
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,077
the other side with
the record shop.

443
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:31,616
Now it looks like a nondescript
barbecue joint, but

444
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:36,521
back in 1963 it was the
home of deep city records.

445
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:39,124
Willie Clark and his business

446
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:44,930
partner Johnny Peersol
started deep city.

447
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:47,532
The label became a showcase for

448
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:51,903
artists like Betty Wright, frank

449
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:58,209
Williams and the Rocketeers.

450
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,380
It is a very, very long
list, an amazing list.

451
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,482
It is about 1200.

452
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,752
1200 songs.

453
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:09,487
It just flows.

454
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,889
I'm like a song mechanic.

455
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,058
You bring it to me.

456
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,625
I'll help you fix it.

457
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:21,299
William and his writing partner
wrote such classics as

458
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:27,005
"clean up woman" and
"rocking chair."

459
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,574
50 years, 100 years from now,

460
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,242
if you were to do an Internet

461
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,677
search and punch in the Miami

462
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:33,812
sound, your name is going to

463
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,514
come up right away as principal

464
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,116
creator of the Miami sound.

465
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,317
What were the distinctive

466
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,152
features of the music you were

467
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,522
making that separated it from

468
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,457
Motown, Philadelphia, New York?

469
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:52,964
The culture was a mixture of

470
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,632
Bahamian, Jamaican, and people

471
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:58,970
came down from Georgia and
Alabama, but that Bahamian

472
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,305
influence was dominant.

473
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:01,140
Right.

474
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:06,644
We would have bands who would

475
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,780
march from Overtown all the way

476
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:15,020
to Liberty city and
back in big parades.

477
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:15,855
This influence, the dancing and

478
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:22,127
the moving and the marching,

479
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:22,728
that was the main difference.

480
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:24,996
And you were teaching school
through a lot of this?

481
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,398
Yeah, I was teaching.

482
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,167
I would look around, put my sign

483
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:31,169
in, and walk out the back door

484
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,172
and go straight to the studio.

485
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,842
But you know, the principal
knew what I was doing.

486
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:37,543
Yep.

487
00:29:37,544 --> 00:29:44,883
I did most of the deep city
music using that technique.

played, still being
sampled, which is good.

492
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:15,080
It weren't for the samples,
I don't know what I'd do.

493

Europe and Japan.

500
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,738

Miami is like that.

508
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,284
You can eat your way across the

509
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,686
Caribbean and through all of

510
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:31,789
Latin America and then over
to Africa, if you'd like.

511
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,758
It's all there.

512
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:35,026
If you know anything about me,

513
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:37,495
you know I love few things more

514
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,664
than big, new, unusual, comes

515
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:41,632

versions of the giant hamburger

517
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,606
and this one, this one
is something special.

518
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:53,378
This is a tall Venezuelan.

519
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:57,548
It is all about a lot of sauces.

520
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,317
We're going to do this.

521
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:02,320
Absolutely, right?

522
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:02,521
Okay.

523
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:06,657
What is this neighborhood?

524
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:11,162
Some people call it petite

525
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:14,865
Venezuela, and yeah,
you're way west.

526
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:18,769
You'll pretty much hear
everybody here speak Spanish.

527
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:23,641
There's almost no
English spoken.

528
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:27,979
Even if they are not Latin.

529
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,016
You have to speak Spanish.

530
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:33,851
Meat on meat is something of

531
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:37,388
a Venezuelan specialty
and this one has a lot.

532
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:44,529
A beef Patty, ham, egg, six

533
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,731
varieties of sauces,
potatoes and cheese.

534
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:49,267
This one is big, big I tell you.

535
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:52,170
You have to demolish it in

536
00:32:52,171 --> 00:33:00,171
stages like a hyena devouring
an antelope by the hoof.

537
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,749
I'm going to start crying.

538
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,251
All right.

539
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,785
I'm going in.

540
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:08,054
Good god.

541
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:10,588
Yes or no?

542
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:15,093
It's delicious, but...
