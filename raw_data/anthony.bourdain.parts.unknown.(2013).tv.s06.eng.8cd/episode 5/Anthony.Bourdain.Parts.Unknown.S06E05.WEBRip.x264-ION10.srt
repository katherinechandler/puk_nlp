17
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,779
<i>But take a look.</i>

18
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,572
Addis Ababa.

19
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,532
<i>Capital city of Ethiopia.</i>

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,285
<i>A cool high altitude urban center that will</i>

21
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,123
<i>both confirm and confound expectations.</i>

22
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,712
<i>Fueled largely by direct</i>

23
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,964
<i>foreign investment and a returning</i>

24

<i>Ethiopian diaspora eager to
be</i> part of the new growth.

25
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,343
<i>Things are changing in Addis.</i>

26
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:20,307
<i>It's one of the fastest growing
economies in the world.</i>

27
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,195
<i>- It's not the first time the place
has gone - through a growth spurt.</i>

28
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:36,281
<i>In the 1950s Emperor Haile Selassie known</i>

29
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,365
<i>as the king of kings,</i>

30
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,369
<i>embarked on a similar program
of massive public works.</i>

31
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,414
<i>This was supposed to be legacy of Ethiopia.</i>

32
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,291
<i>The future.</i>

33
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,065
<i>But the next time Ethiopia found itself</i>

34
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:50,837
<i>in the headlines,</i>

35
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,339
<i>it was for this.</i>

36
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,302
And for many of us, that
was the end of the story.

37
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,975
So I'm looking forward to this week.

38
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,935
I can't wait to show you Ethiopia.

39
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,896
- I've been waiting for you, I mean,
- I tell you right now.

40
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:09,689
You couldn't have picked a better time

41
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,983
because we have old Ethiopia right here

42
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,819
and we also have new Ethiopia right here.

43
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,238
And that's like a that combo
is going to be so cool.

44
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,365
<i>Marcus Samuelsson.</i>

45
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,618
<i>Maybe you know him from such
shows as a lot of them,</i>

46
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,870
<i>or his many restaurants.</i>

47
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,707
<i>His best selling memoir, his
status as America's most</i>

48
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,127
<i>recognizable black chef.</i>

49
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,420
<i>But Marcus isn't African-American.</i>

50
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:37,050
<i>He's Sweden-American,
Ethiopian-Swedish-American.</i>

51
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,592
<i>Look, It's complicated.</i>

52
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,825
<i>What is true to say is
that Marcus Samuelsson</i>

53
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:43,056
<i>like his wife, Maya,</i>

54
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,975
<i>was born here in Ethiopia.</i>

55
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,936
So when is the last time
you were in Ethiopia?

56
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,148
Four years ago, and you
can tell it's changed.

57
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,482
Changed a lot.

58
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,276
I'm interested in seeing an African country

59
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:00,614
that was never colonized.

60
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,701
It was never taken by Europe.

61
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,869
No, that sense of pride,

62
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,747
You really hit the nail on the head.

63
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,332
I mean, that sense of
pride is also the sense

64
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,960
of that everyone wants to come back.

65
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,087
How does it feel coming back?

66
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,213
Is it weird at all?

67
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,339
You feel like you're coming home?

68
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,800
It is weird. But end of the day,

69
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,843
I always love it. I miss it.

70
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,138
One foot of me is like, just Ethiopian,

71
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,348
But then the other foot
is so Swedish or American

72
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,267
at this point, Right?

73
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:31,562
You do not speak the language,
Or any of the dialects.

74
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,982
Ahh... You've since come back,
You reconnected with family.

75
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:35,817
Yeah.

76
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,693
But it must be weird to, I mean...

77
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,854
It is. You need a translator.

78
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,074
No, But... I need a translator.

79
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,077
My wife is now my translator in life and in

80
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:47,078
culture and so many things,

81
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,498
But I think when you're a black man,

82
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,042
when you're immigrants,

83
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,668
when you're Ethiopian,

84
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,087
when you're Sweden,

85
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,194
I've been put into so many situations

86
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:00,299
that I put myself into.

87
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,636
So, I'm actually very comfortable in being

88
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,972
uncomfortable.

89
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:14,147
<i>In the 1970s Ethiopia was hit
with a tuberculosis epidemic.</i>

90
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,651
<i>Marcus, his older sister Fenti
and his mom were all stricken</i>

91
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:19,153
<i>with the disease.</i>

92
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,617
<i>With no possibility of medical
attention in their village,</i>

93
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,829
<i>facing the almost inevitable
death of both her children,</i>

94
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,665
<i>Marcus' mom set out on
foot with her daughter</i>

95
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,499
<i>at her side and</i>

96
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,918
<i>2-year-old Marcus on her back.</i>

97
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,132
<i>Walking 75 miles to the
Swedish hospital in Aris.</i>

98
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,762
<i>Against all odds, they made it.</i>

99
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,639
<i>Marcus and Fenti recovered.</i>

100
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,809
<i>Their mother did not. Marcus and his sister</i>

101
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,067
<i>were adopted by</i>

102
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,069
<i>Ann Marie and Leonard Samuelsson.</i>

103
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,032
<i>And raised from that point on in Sweden.</i>

104
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,453
<i>Ethiopia it's language,
it's food, it's culture's</i>

105
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:12,872
<i>were largely a mystery.</i>

106
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,292
<i>Marcus traveled and trained
apprenticing in some of the</i>

107
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:17,710
<i>great kitchens of Europe.</i>

108
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,628
<i>He moved to New York.</i>

109
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,088
<i>At the remarkably young age after 23</i>

110
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,381
<i>received three stars from
"The New York Times"</i>

111
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,844
<i>at his groundbreaking Restaurant, Aquavit.</i>

112
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,014
<i>It's been a pretty stellar rise since then.</i>

113
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,727
<i>And in 2010 he opened
Red Rooster in Harlem.</i>

114
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,603
I always find so paradox that,

115
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,815
I was born into very little food,

116
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,443
but yet sort of I made my
whole life about food.

117
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,093
My sort of structure and
pragmatism comes from being

118
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:48,741
raised in Sweden,

119
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,245
and my soul of vibrancy
and warms to cooking

120
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:56,250
and feel-based food that I love,
comes definitely from here.

121
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,756
<i>- Weirdly enough the single aspect of
Ethiopian culture - most westerners</i>

122
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,384
<i>Do know a little about is Ethiopian food.</i>

123
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,344
<i>So maybe you've had this.</i>

124
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,554
Oh, wow.

125
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,223
That looks good.

126
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,392
That... that is exciting.

127
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,352
What is it?

128
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:17,333
This is typical, Ethiopian vegetarian,

129
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,313
make it really nice.

130
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,816
<i>At Kata Togna Restaurant
they do it classic.</i>

131
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,028
<i>Injera bread, that's Ethiopian 101.</i>

132
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,821
I mean, you think about
Ethiopian food right,

133
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,741
The foundation is really the Injera bread.

134
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,451
It's not just food, it's an implement.

135
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,078
Yeah.

136
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,393
<i>We're having beyaynetu,
a selection of stews or</i>

137
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:37,706
<i>wat as they called around here.</i>

138
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,708
<i>That's goman sauteed greens.</i>

139
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,919
<i>Shiro Wat which is a chickpea stew.</i>

140
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,047
<i>And tikil gomen, sauteed white cabbage.</i>

141
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,092
<i>Many, if not most of the dishes,
spiced with the magical</i>

142
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,845
<i>mysterious flavoring of the gods.
Burburing.</i>

143
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,600
Can I give you one that normally we do it.

144
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,603
They say gursha.

145
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,938
You have to.

146
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,129
<i>This is stuffing of food
in your fellow diners'</i>

147
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,318
<i>face is called "Gursha",</i>

148
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,405
<i>and it's what you do to show
your affection and respect.</i>

149
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,596
<i>Try this at the waffle house sometime and</i>

150
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,785
<i>prepare for awkwardness.</i>

151
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,205
Now, Maya you were born here?

152
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:18,999
I was born here.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,166
Left what age?

154
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,126
13.

155
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,542
I grew up in Holland.

156
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,544
Then after that we all went to

157
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:29,091
London, Germany, and I'm in New York now.

158
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,969
I don't want to say it's
a rootless existence,

159
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,181
but it's...

160
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,267
You know, where's home?

161
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,022
I think for us now, Harlem is really home.

162
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,858
But when I've been gone for two years,

163
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,734
I'm like, I got to go back.

164
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,112
Because the beat is just so
different than what Sweden

165
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,489
can offer me

166
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,616
