32
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,010
First order of business, dinner.

33
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:02,723
Been on a plane for, like,
I don't know, it was long.

34
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,852
Very long.

35
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:10,023
Saw, like, five Mark Wahlberg films.

36
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,108
I can't tell you how excited
I am about the prospect

37
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,361
of getting some black pepper crab...

38
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,282
and some pork gladed noodles
and a regional beverage.

39
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,996
Reasonably cold.

40
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,749
I don't even know what this is.

41
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,335
I love you, noodles.

42
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,505
Don't want to get all heavy and
philosophical at this point,

43
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,924
but why I'm here, what my mission is,

44
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,843
what I expect to find,

45
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,096
basically me tracing my steps and all that.

46
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,850
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, noodles.

47
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,145
Good.

48
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,189
This place is most excellent.

49
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,524
Ah, char kuey teow. Char kuey teow.

50
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,401
Char kuey teow, bitches.

51
00:03:55,402 --> 00:04:00,698
Oh, look at the greasy,
fatty, yes, come to daddy.

52
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,450
I'm a bad man.

53
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,870
This is, like, a random restaurant,

54
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,873
with like a purloined Minnie Mouse logo

55
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,292
and their food is unbelievably good.

56
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,754
Oh, yeah. Black pepper crab.

57
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,549
Right here. Reveal yourself to me.

58
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,718
Hot, hot, hot.

59
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,055
Ooh! Oh, yeah.

60
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,435
Wow.

61
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,939
All right. The frenzy's over.

62
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,110
Now to eat in a more relaxed phase.

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:57,255
<i>Kuala Lumpur rises up out of
steamy, equatorial jungle,</i>

64
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,673
<i>Malaysia's capital city.</i>

65
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,718
<i>A chaotic, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural</i>

66
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:10,517
<i>modern metropolis of

67
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,064
<i>- This is where you start out when

68
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:15,898
<i>To your ex-headhunter friends</i>

69
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,236
<i>to return for Gawai, the annual
Iban rice harvest festival.</i>

70
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,404
What's interesting the
last time I was there was

71
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:26,867
the old guys with their tattoos
and rings on their fingers.

72
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,744
Yeah, the old people,

73
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,163
a lot of them have passed on.

74
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,872
I hear no more skulls.

75
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:36,669
They made them put the skulls away.

76
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,337
<i>The Iban once enjoyed a
truly formidable reputation</i>

77
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,007
<i>as trackers, warriors,</i>

78
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,260
<i>and ritualistic takers of heads.</i>

79
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,387
<i>They were and continue to be wanderers.</i>

80
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,474
<i>Valuing a tradition where every tribesman</i>

81
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,434
<i>was set out from the longhouse of his birth</i>

82
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,189
<i>to travel, learn, to bring something back.</i>

83
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,233
<i>Each tattoo he gets over
the course of his life</i>

84
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,568
<i>represents a different experience,</i>

85
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,321
<i>a different journey.</i>

86
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,032
Basically the tattoos signify knowledge

87
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,450
and the wealth they brought
back to the longhouse,

88
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,663
what you probably would want to get is a...

89
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,831
Something like this.

90
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,125
Ah, like that. Yeah.

91
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,628
Since last I saw you, you
were, and you gave me this.

92
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,340
And it's still there. Still there.

93
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,218
<i>Ten years ago at his shop, Borneo Ink,</i>

94
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,762
<i>Eddie David tattooed me with
an Iban style ouroborous.</i>

95
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,389
<i>The symbol of a snake eating its own tail.</i>

96
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,644
<i>Life, death, the eternal ebb and flow.</i>

97
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,106
<i>I think I was going through a hippy phase.</i>

98
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,941
<i>Eddie does great work</i>

99
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,194
<i>and he's known for
traditional tribal tattoos</i>

100
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,780
<i>but I'm looking forward to
getting it done old school.</i>

101

<i>Hand tapped in the jungle.</i>

102
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,409
So, I need your advice

103
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,620
because I'm going back to the same village

104
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,749
that I went to last time.

105
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,793
Just be careful of the...

106
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,837
Yes, they had it in every type of bottle.

107
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,049
This is clear sort of cloudy
liquid with particles in it.

108
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,801
Sometimes they put weird stuff inside.

109
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,284
My dad used to tell me
they take mosquito coil

110
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:12,765
and leave it inside the...

111
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,933
A mosquito what?

112
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:14,893
Coil.

113
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:15,935
Like the pesticide?

114
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,144
Yeah.

115
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,771
Just make it, like, stronger.

116
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,899
I would imagine so.

117
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,734
That's a natural staple,

118
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:28,781
Gawai, usually drinking, passing
out, waking up, eating, drinking

119
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:33,702
passing out again then getting
up and drinking some more.

120
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,828
Yeah.

121
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,789

I love watching you guys eat.

Who was the good cook in your family?

159
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,701
When we were small,

160
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,913
my grandmother would say stuff
like, I don't care who you are,

161
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,333

- Yeah.

163
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,546
There's no teaching Malay cooking here.

164
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,924
It comes from your grandma's
kitchen, your mom's kitchen.

165
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,803
And you learn by smelling, by seeing...

166
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,390
<i>It's how I teach my children to cook.</i>

167
