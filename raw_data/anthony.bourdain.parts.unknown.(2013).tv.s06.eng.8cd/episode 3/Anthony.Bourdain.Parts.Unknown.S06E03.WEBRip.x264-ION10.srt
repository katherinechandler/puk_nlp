<i>What does it mean to be strong?</i>

2
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,888
<i>It implies hardness, inflexibility.</i>

3
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,934
<i>Okinawa is a place with a fighting tradition.</i>

4
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:22,313
<i>A history of ferocious resistance.</i>

5
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,650
<i>But it's nothing like what you might think.</i>

6
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,027

<i>This is Okinawa.</i>

16
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,039
<i>Just south of mainland Japan.</i>

17
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,082
<i>For all the relative rigidity of the mainland,</i>

18
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,878
<i>Okinawa answers in its own unique way.</i>

19
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,130
<i>Don't eat the same thing each day. That's boring.</i>

20
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,008
<i>There's even an Okinawan term for it,</i>

21
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,552
<i>"chanpuru," something mixed.</i>

22
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:38,180
<i>Bits borrowed from all over,
served up for anyone to eat.</i>

23
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,099
<i>But maybe you're more familiar
with the name, Okinawa,</i>

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,310
<i>from this, as the setting</i>

25
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,772
<i>for some of the most horrifyingly bloody battles</i>

26
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:49,651
<i>of the Second World War. How horrifying?</i>

27
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,531
<i>For the Allies, there were
more than 50,000 casualties</i>

28
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,492
<i>with around 12,000 killed or missing in action,</i>

29
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,662
<i>over nearly three months of fighting.</i>

30
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,624
<i>More than 100,000 Japanese soldiers</i>

31
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,461
<i>and Okinawan conscripts were
killed defending the island.</i>

32
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,505
<i>Civilians were stuck in the
middle of the two armies</i>

33
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,924
<i>and got crushed.</i>

34
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,884
<i>No one will know for sure,</i>

35
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:19,597
<i>but historians estimate 150,000
men, women, and children</i>

36
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,267
<i>lost their lives during the battle.</i>

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,937
<i>What most don't know is that Okinawa had only</i>

38
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,564
<i>become Japan fairly recently.</i>

39
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,692
<i>That to a great extent,
Okinawans didn't even consider</i>

40
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,195
<i>themselves really Japanese, or vice versa.</i>

41
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,991
<i>That Okinawans and Japanese considered themselves</i>

42
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,327
<i>to be different ethnicities,
spoke two different languages</i>

43
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,955
<i>and culturally, culinarily, and in many other ways</i>

44
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,206
<i>looked in different directions.</i>

45
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:52,046
<i>Yet, Okinawans were asked to
make the ultimate sacrifice,</i>

46
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,299
<i>and they did.</i>

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,885
<i>That's not just ancient history.</i>

48
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,681
<i>It informs the present, still.</i>

49
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,767
<i>Okinawa is the largest of over 100 islands</i>

50
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,603
<i>making up the Ryukyu island chain.</i>

51
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:12,275
<i>It's just over 300 miles from
the mainland, but worlds apart.</i>

52
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,487
<i>Okinawa is different.</i>

53
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,281
<i>It's tropical. Clear waters.</i>

54
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,034
<i>Some of the best beaches in Asia,</i>

55
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,911
<i>with a decidedly more laid back, less frenetic,</i>

56
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:28,290
<i>self-serious attitude than the mainland.</i>

57
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,753
<i>You can feel it. You can see it.</i>

58
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,757
<i>It's just different here.</i>

59
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:47,226
<i>2,000 pounds of heavily muscled
beef enters the arena.</i>

60
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,064
<i>You can feel the ground shake
under its heavy hooves.</i>

61
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:54,026
<i>His opponent awaits.</i>

62
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,864
<i>Togyu, also known as ushi-zumo</i>

63
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:04,078
<i>sumo, yes, but bull sumo.</i>

64
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,669
<i>These are professionals,</i>

65
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,256
<i>and like Jake LaMotta and Chuck Wepner before them,</i>

66
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,301
<i>they shall live to fight, or
do other stuff, another day.</i>

67
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,388
<i>Having shed decidedly less blood than either</i>

68
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,016
<i>of those two gentlemen.</i>

69
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,896
<i>Two animals, two handlers.</i>

70
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:35,233
<i>And they do, like, the Burgess
Meredith job in</i> Rocky.

71
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,359
<i>Like fighters in sumo, the bulls are ranked</i>

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,362
<i>by their ability, their record in the ring.</i>

73
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,157
<i>The highest being yokozuna.</i>

74
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,868
<i>This is Kenny Aman. He lives up the road.</i>

75
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,871
Is there a time limit or do
they go till somebody gives up?

76
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,208
I think they pretty much go
until somebody gives up.

77
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,668
When it gets... -A points system?

78
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,213
No, no, there's no points system.

79
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,299
Basically, when the other one
turns around and runs away,

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,885
that's the winner.

81
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,054
Few times one bull will
actually get around to the side

82
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,680
and actually be able to flip the bull over.

83
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,226
Right. Win, lose or survive? Both?

84
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,770
Once in a while, you'll have injuries,

85
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,231
but most of the time the bulls go home.

86
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,233
They go home to be happy. -They do.

87
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,359
Nobody's turned into steak or cutlets.

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,279
No.

89
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,363
<i>Togyu started as early as the 17th century</i>

90
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,075
<i>with farmers pitting bull against bull.</i>

91
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,368
<i>They love it in agricultural communities like this,</i>

92
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,246
<i>so much so that it was briefly banned</i>

93
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,832
<i>in some places because farmers
were spending too much time</i>

94
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,294
<i>at the fights and not enough
time growing sugarcane.</i>

95
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,838
<i>Like Cus D'Amato and the young Tyson,</i>

96
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,091
<i>their handlers raise these beasts from calves,</i>

97
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,509
<i>caring for them on one hand,</i>

98
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,303
<i>and training them, conditioning them</i>

99
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:49,224
<i>to be monsters in the ring on the other.</i>

100
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,187
Oh! -Oh!

101
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,908
Yeah. Does one wager on this?

102
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:12,079
I guess the official answer would be

103
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,459
that gambling's illegal in Japan, but...

104
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,545
<i>Intermission.</i>

105
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,923
<i>Time for a corndog, some funnel cake, curly fries?</i>

00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,052
<i>No. Better. Much better. Yakitori.</i>

107
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,888
<i>Yes, they have that. But when in Okinawa,</i>

108
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,183
<i>do as the Okinawans do. Yakisoba.</i>

109
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,476
<i>Start with pork belly, as one always should.</i>

110
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,937
<i>Some hacked up sausage, cabbage, carrots,</i>

111

<i>and sauce, soy, mirin, brown sugar, vinegar,</i>

113
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,738
<i>and a bit of sake. Top with seaweed powder,</i>

114
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,576
<i>some pickled ginger garnish, and eat. Now.</i>

Oh, yeah. -Oh, he's ready to go.

We haven't seen his opponent.

119
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,175
Oh, yeah.

120
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,969

So you grew up in New Jersey.

149
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,897
How did you find your way to Okinawa?

150
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,901
Well, my mom was from here. My dad was in the Navy.

151
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,903
Mm-hm. -He was stationed here.

152
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,323
Met my mom and wound up back in New Jersey

153
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,116
because that's where my dad was from, Paterson.

154
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,119
And I was born and raised there.

155
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,624
The school I went to was
predominantly Caucasian kids.

156
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,920
There wasn't many Asian-Americans at all.

157
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,713
Right. -And I always had

158
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,675
this kind of, like, identity complex.

159
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,178
There would be, like, times where people would come

160
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,514
to the house. They'd say,
"Oh, where's your mom from?

161
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,974
"- Is she from China?" -Oh, God, right.

162
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,769
Open the refrigerator and there
would be some weird food.

163
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,439
"Hey, what's that?" Every time I heard that,

164
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,400
I was like, wow, am I, like, am I different?

165
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,735
So one day my mom says

166
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,572
we're going back to Okinawa on a family trip.

167
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,407
I was 17 years old. -You'd never been

168
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,075
up to that point? -No, but when I got off

169
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,578
the plane, I don't know what it was.

170
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,582
It was like, I'm here, this is my home.

171
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,961
Being able to connect to my
heritage, I felt something.

172
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,880
I was like, wow, I belong here.

173
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,008
How about the food? What was in that refrigerator?

174
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:39,054
Because I know a lot of kids who
grew up with that same sort

175
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,266
of uncertainty

176
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,726
when they brought their friends home from school

177
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,146
to their house and opened the refrigerator.

178
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:51,942
You know, kimchee, or cabbage, or fish sauce.

179
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,278
They were aware of it when
they visited their friends.

180
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,071
And they were acutely uncomfortable with it

181
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,199
when their friends came over.
Man, have things changed,

182
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,785
as far as attitudes,

183
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,456
pretty much the engine of the new American cuisine,

184
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,833
are kids with childhoods like yours.

185
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,044
I don't mean what's hip, what's the next new thing.

186
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:16,425
I mean, literally redefining
what is American cuisine.

187
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,636
Let's put it this way.

188
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:22,264
The central irony of this story is that, you know,

189
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,892
your mom would have been, like, hipster hero.

190
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,980
<i>Still another American invasion</i>

191
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,690
<i>in the Pacific. The objective is Okinawa,</i>

192
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,528
<i>one of the ring of island
fortresses protecting Japan</i>

193
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,280
<i>300 miles away.</i>

194
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,699
<i>On April 1st, 1945,</i>

195
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,204
<i>a U.S. invasion fleet of nearly 1,500 ships,</i>

196
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,333
<i>a landing force of 182,000 people,</i>

197
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:53,587
<i>that's 75,000 more than
Normandy, approached Okinawa.</i>

198
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:57,466
<i>What came next was what Okinawans called</i>

199
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,428
<i>a typhoon of steel.</i>

200
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,226
<i>Having island hopped across the Pacific,</i>

201
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:11,522
<i>Allied forces saw Okinawa as a
key base for fleet anchorage,</i>

202
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,358
<i>troop staging and air operations for the final push</i>

203
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,985
<i>into the Japanese mainland and victory.</i>

204
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,030
<i>The fighting was brutal for both sides.</i>

205
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,116
<i>The cost in lives and resources
for the Allied forces</i>

206
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,536
<i>was tremendous. And when it was over,</i>

207
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,163
<i>military planners looked at the mainland,</i>

208
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,374
<i>looked at what Okinawa had cost them,</i>

209
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,294
<i>and projected even more appalling losses.</i>

210
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,465
<i>What came next, we all know.</i>

211
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,429
<i>What is not widely known is that more people died</i>

212
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,181
<i>during the Battle of Okinawa than all those killed</i>

213
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:51,229
<i>during the atomic bombings
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</i>

214
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,743
Right. -So they had to

215
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:10,247
keep the U.S. military forces as long as possible

216
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,959
in Okinawa, so that they could prepare defense

217
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,253
to protect mainland Japan.

218
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:21,091
So ever since the Battle of Okinawa,

219
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:25,387
Okinawan people say we were sort of...

220
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,181
What do you call it? -Sacrifice?

221
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,392
Yes. Uh-huh.

222
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:34,313
<i>Masahide Ota is a former governor of Okinawa.</i>

223
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,524
<i>In 1945, he was a young conscript</i>

224
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,443
<i>in the Japanese imperial army.</i>

225
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,529
<i>He fought hard and bravely against the Allies</i>

226
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,949
<i>until he saw Japanese soldiers murdering Okinawans</i>

227
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,745
<i>for food and water, and his faith melted away.</i>

228
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:54,874
<i>Getowan is a private home turned restaurant</i>

229
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,835
<i>serving very traditional Okinawan dishes.</i>

230
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,547
<i>In honor of their outspoken former governor,</i>

231
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,840
<i>the restaurant has prepared a dish typically served</i>

232
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:07,429
<i>to royals and VIPs in what
was one the Ryukyu Kingdom.</i>

233
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,974
<i>It's called tundabun, after the lacquered dish</i>

234
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,853
<i>the multi bite-sized portions are presented in.</i>

235
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,774
Let's eat.

236
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,904
Very good.

237
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,369
<i>There's some squid,</i>

238
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,706
<i>swordfish wrapped in seaweed and simmered in stock</i>

239
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,042
<i>and fermented sake.</i>

240
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,132
<i>Dried sea snake wrapped in kombu and slow simmered.</i>

241
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,596
<i>Burdock root wrapped in pork loin and slow cooked</i>

242
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,392
<i>in tatsuo stock.</i>

243
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,268
<i>Okinawan taro, flash-fried,</i>

244
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,188
<i>then dressed with sugar and soy.</i>

245
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:03,152
<i>And pork shoulder dredged in
black sesame then steamed.</i>

246
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:13,078
You have described that, uh,

247
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,166
you were shocked and surprised
to see the Japanese soldiers,

248
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,422
their treatment of Okinawans was
not good during the battle.

249
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:43,024
And if you use the Okinawan language,

250
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,278
you will be killed as a spy, you know?

251
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,154
Right. -But Okinawan people

252
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,824
could not understand standard language.

253
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:55,871
So when Japanese soldiers
killed lots of local people...

254
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,583
Particularly given the experience of the war,

255
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,378
how Japanese do you think most people feel here?

256
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,672
There's a fundamental difference between

257
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,508
Japanese culture and Okinawan culture.

258
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,095
Japanese culture is war culture,

259
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,725
but Okinawan culture is absence of militarism.

260
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,018
Okinawan people are happy-go-lucky people.

261
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,772
Do you think that easygoing...

262
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:26,610
that reputation, that tradition
of being happy-go-lucky,

263
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,194
do you think this has led

264
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,572
to Okinawans being taken advantage of?

265
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:35,327
I mean, for instance, the U.S. military bases.

266
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,872
Okinawa is one percent of the landmass of Japan,

267
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,708
and yet what percentage of the military bases

268
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,419
are here on Okinawa? Almost all of them.

269
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,464
Okinawa seems to be asked to
make a lot of sacrifices,

270
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,384
uh, for the mainland. Will that ever step?

271
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,137
You are talking about NIMBY.

272
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,141
"Not in my backyard." -Yes, yes.

273
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,397
<i>For a place with as bloody a history,</i>

274
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,567
<i>Okinawa is today noticeably more laid back</i>

275
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,487
<i>than the mainland, but that does not mean</i>

276
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:14,658
<i>everybody's forgotten their warrior traditions.</i>

277
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,243
<i>When the feudal Satsuma empire from the mainland</i>

278
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:21,331
<i>invaded Okinawa in 1609, they banned the carrying,</i>

279
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,543
<i>manufacture or use of weapons of any kind.</i>

280
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,379
<i>The ban was later reinforced in 1879</i>

281
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,632
<i>when Japan formally annexed the island.</i>

282
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,010
<i>It's believed these prohibitions</i>

283
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:37,222
<i>led directly to the development
of a new style of martial art,</i>

is that it was used primarily as a defensive art.

345
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,539
In other words, being able to, you know,

346
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,667
control and subdue the opponent.

347
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,170
Usually if you could, in a humane way,

348
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,672
but then if you had to finish them,

349
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,299
then you had the ability to finish them.

350
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,135
The striking is important,

351
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,637
but a lot of the technique is not about striking.

352
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,680
It's about submission techniques.

353
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,268
Some of that is to do with
kyushu, attacking nervepoints.

354
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,478
And Hokama Sensei, in particular,

355
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:58,150
is extremely skilled at dealing with, you know,

356
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,319
bigger, stronger opponents. -Human engineering.

357
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,488
Very important.

358
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,075
Point, point, point, point, point,

359
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,036
Point, point, point, point,

360
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,414
then this point.

361
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:19,254
No... No... open.

362

<i>The demonstration of Hokama Sensei's open-hand</i>

363
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:27,513

little too real for my taste.</i>

364
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,599
Awful.

365
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,312
<i>Human engineering with a terrifying logic,</i>

<i>one attacks the weak point.</i>

367
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,774
<i>All I know how to do in this situation, by the way,</i>

368
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,569
<i>is pull guard and look for
something to choke or lock.</i>

369
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,239
<i>Nope. Apparently, they don't know</i>

370
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,616
<i>what tapping out means here. I was tapping</i>

371
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,576

push that 71-year-old finger</i>

373
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,165
<i>right into my brain pan.</i>

374
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,210
There was a saying in the old
days if there was a fight

375
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:02,547
happening somewhere in town,
people would go have a look

376
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,549
and they'd say, are they fighting

377
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,635
with fists or open hands? If
they're fighting with fists,

378
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,554
they'd say, don't bother, it's an amateur fight.

379
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,015
If they were fighting with open hands,

380
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,517
they knew they were masters.

00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:45,751
So I consider myself a pretty pro-military guy,

but why are the Marines here?

428
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:53,385
I like marines, but, you know,
I'm not Robert McNamara.

429
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,054
But it seems to me, if you go to war with China,

430
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,056
sending in the Marines is probably not

431
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,391
what you're gonna be doing.

432
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,059
People of your generation,

433
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,435
what do you think the attitude is

434
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,354
towards the military bases?

435
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:07,899
As long as we're not living near the base,

436
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,235
it doesn't affect us that much.

437
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,653
Near the base, it makes a difference.

438
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,113
Right. I mean, near...

439
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,367
It... you know right away.

440
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:21,538
Tattoo parlors, strip clubs, vape shops.

441
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:26,335
And also, you know, it's very loud.
That's a big issue.

442
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,964
Tourism is probably the future of Okinawa. Yes?

443
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,093
I mean, beautiful weather. Beaches.

444
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:39,556
If the bases leave, it's going
to be big hotels and resorts

445
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,891
and golf courses. Which is worse?

446
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,727
Chinese tourists or American Marines?

447
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:49,857
I'll stick with the Marines. -

448
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,777
Semper fi.

00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,865
<i>Not everybody here agrees with Vivian,</i>

<i>by a long shot. Okinawans may
be easygoing and laid back,</i>

451
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,122

00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,755
<i>from a central government with different cultural</i>

455
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,550
<i>and historical traditions, who don't consider</i>

456
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,552
<i>their needs or priorities.</i>

457
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:21,097
<i>Their hugely disproportionate shouldering</i>

458
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:25,184
<i>of the U.S. military presence
for the entire country.</i>

459
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,563
<i>Currently there are close to
30 military installations</i>

460
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:32,400
<i>on Okinawa, and even though

461
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,278
<i>Japanese prefectures in terms of livable area,</i>

462
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,196
<i>they accommodate more than half</i>

463
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,699
<i>of the foreign military presence.</i>

464
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,037
<i>Even more problematic, much
of Okinawa's arable land</i>

465
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,499
<i>suitable for farming on an island whose whole</i>

466
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,042
<i>traditional identity was built around farming</i>

467
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,921
<i>is eaten up by military bases.</i>

468
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:01,387
The military base issue, is this more important

469
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,139
for older people or younger people?

470
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,682
- It's for older people.
- It's for the older people.

471
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:09,479
Yes. So when you actually go to
a place where they have, like,

472
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,149
a protest going on, I will say
over 80 percent of the people

473
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:18,237
- are all retired persons.
- Why do you think that is?

474
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:23,284
This is only my opinion, but Japanese imperial army

475
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,120
did a lot of brutal stuff on this island

476
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,040
and war never ended for some people.

477
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,376
And the feelings that they got suppressed,

478
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,919
all of a sudden, after they retired,

479
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,797
they kind of burst and they wanted to kind of...

480
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,633
Act out. -Act out.

481
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,594
<i>This is Keji Yota,</i>

482
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,179
<i>he's an Okinawan farmer,</i>

483
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,723
<i>and this is Nishimachi,</i>

484
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,685
<i>a small noodle shop that
bears only the owner's name</i>

485
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,938
<i>and serves only Okinawan-style soba.</i>

486
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,067
<i>Pork belly or ribs is the meat.</i>

487
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,695
<i>The broth a mix of fish, chicken, pork,</i>

488
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,113
<i>and vegetable stocks.</i>

489
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,199
<i>Okinawan soba differs greatly</i>

490
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,451
<i>from what we know from the mainland.</i>

491
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,953
<i>They use wheat noodles instead of buckwheat,</i>

492
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,332
<i>a nod perhaps to the spaghetti
eating Marines they lived with</i>

493
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,000
<i>all these years.</i>

494
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,461
<i>Garnishes are spring onion, fish cake</i>

495
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,214
<i>and slices of omelet. Add your pickled ginger,</i>

496
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:22,176
<i>and togarashi hot sauce, and hoo-rah.</i>

497
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,514
It seems the anti-base sentiment also coincides

498
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,183
with an anti-central government sentiment.

499
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,061
You do bear a hugely disproportionate

500
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:36,023
burden of bases. Isn't some
activism called for here?

501
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:40,612
I think the young generation
should decide what to do

502
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:43,864
for our future instead of the
old people just fighting

503
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,825
for their beliefs.

504
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:51,997
To me, I really feel a strong need to forgive.

505
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,876
Mm-hm. -And then forget.

506
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,881
<i>Long before the war, the Americans arrived.</i>

507
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,760
<i>Long before the Satsuma invaded from the mainland,</i>

508
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:07,513
<i>Okinawa was a kingdom. The Ryukyu Kingdom.</i>

509
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,642
<i>A prosperous and peaceful island chain</i>

510
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,351
<i>with no standing army.</i>

511
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:16,855
<i>They were farmers, traders,
and necessarily diplomats</i>

512
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,610
<i>whose eyes, more often than
not, looked west to China</i>

513
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:23,862
<i>rather than to the more isolated mainland.</i>

514
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,574
<i>While Japan as it existed then was isolationist,</i>

515
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,701

develop here and have the locals

They have produce from the land,
