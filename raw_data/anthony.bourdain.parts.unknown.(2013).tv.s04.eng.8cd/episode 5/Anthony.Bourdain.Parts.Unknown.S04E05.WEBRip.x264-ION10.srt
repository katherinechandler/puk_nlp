Four generations, that's
starting out in the...

63
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,687
Late 1700s.

64
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,221
Wow.

65
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,089
Who built this neighborhood?

66
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:58,090
Construction started in 1830s
in a Portuguese colony.

67
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,235
And it started in 1864 but they

68
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,037
lost a lot of power in 1996.

69
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,072
Confused?

70
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,440
Let's take a step back.

71
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,775
The Persians were the first

72
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,378
major power to set up here back

73
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,746
around 975 a.D. Expanding their

74
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:17,116
empire onto the strategically
positioned island.

75
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:22,121
Then the Portuguese used
Zanzibar a hub for their slave

76
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,523
trade and spices.

77
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:28,361
Then they did the same
ultimately with the British who

78
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:33,099
ruled from them.

79
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,501
1964, revolution.

80
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:35,067
As with most revolutions, the

81
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:39,271
days following were
violent, chaotic and ugly.

82
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,441
After overthrowing the mostly

83
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,275
Arab government, reprisals.

84
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,112
It wasn't intended for a

85
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:49,115
revolution where more than 3,000

86
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,618
Arabs and Indians were
moved out of this country.

87
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:52,752
But your family stayed?

88
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,320
My family stayed.

89
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,055
Why?

90
00:05:56,056 --> 00:06:00,259
There was no money for
the family to move out.

91
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,994
Tough times?

92
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:08,801
Very tough times.

93
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:12,805
In about two hours from stone

94
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:16,643
town, this is John Biani,
a tiny fishing village.

95
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:24,644
Here the first revolutionaries
met from an independent

96
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,420
Zanzibar.

97
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:30,823
Total assassination in 1972.

98
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,260
This, too, is a grandson of the

99
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,662
country's first president.

100
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,697
Well, what was the political
situation back then?

101
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,166
Well, it wasn't good.

102
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,534
Basically it was English...

103
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,836
Arabs in the middle and then the

104
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,872
Africans way, way at the bottom.

105
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:48,841
And it was a form of
apartheid, you know.

106
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:52,344
Was this village sort of a
center for revolutionary...

107
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,946
This village was important in

108
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,116
terms of the political support
prior to the revolution.

109
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,718
When my grandfather and my

110
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:02,955
grandmother stayed right here

111
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,526
and had meetings on the
field right over there.

112
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,327
That's where they would have

113
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:08,828
their meetings to raise support

114
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:14,801
for the African people,
their it into identity.

115
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:22,802
The objective was to give
identity to Zanzibar.

116
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,548
Well, this is the house.

117
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:34,488
They are preparing a
wonderful lunch for us.

118
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,731
She used to take care of my

119
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:49,570
grandmother many,
many years ago.

120
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,411
She was a close family friend

121
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,280
to him and his grandparents and

122
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:06,085
she's putting together
quite a spread.

123
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,920
Coconut rice, freshly caught

124
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:11,390
fish called tasi simmered in

125
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,892
broth of garlic and wine topped

126
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,127
with a fresh salad of chopped

127
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:18,430
tomato, eggplant,
cucumber and potato.

128
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,634
Another fish called mackerel

129
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:26,906
marinated in juice and
garlic an pan fried.

130
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:27,808
That's looking good.

131
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:31,443
So coconut rice.

132
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,613
Japati bread from the other
side of the water there.

133
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:34,614
That's it.

134
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:38,117
This is Kasaba.

135
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,952
Two different types
of fried bread.

136
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,088
Wow, what a spread here.

137
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,624
And you can use your hands.

138
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,292
Good.

139
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:46,458
This I can do by hand.

140
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,430
The rice, I need help.

141
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,464
Good.

142
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,301
What do you think of the Kasaba?

143
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,069
Lovely.

144
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,739
The rice is great, too.

145
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,341
Whatever your feelings on
revolutions, it is probably

146
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:07,346
worth remembering that they
start in places like this.

147
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,315
People talking.

148
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:12,151
And when they are one, they are

149
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:16,823
often won by feet of the
original planners, people who

150
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:17,924
look like this.

151
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:21,661
Look at all these kids.

152
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:27,099
Watch out future
revolutionaries.

153
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,768
There's no ideas.

154
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,436
How to change comes from them.

155
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,638
Think about it, the challenges

156
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,140
we face as a small island

157
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,341
country, doesn't the whole world

158
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,508
face a similar challenge?

159
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,344
Yeah.

160
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:39,879
How to preserve all these
things, find balance?

161
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,515
To me, I see Africa as a whole.

162
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:49,221
I see a very interesting timing.

163
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:49,823
Optimistic?

164
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,357
I'm very optimistic and think

165
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,025
we have a lot of great people.

166
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,293
And given the opportunity, I

167
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,696
think they can put a lot on the

168
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,130
table, not only for themselves

169
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,700
but also for the culture of east

170
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,034
Africa and possibly the world.

171
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,035
I think they are great people.

172
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:06,205
Why not?

173
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,641
The sky is the limit, right?

174
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,776
Say you're going to Zanzibar

175
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,912
and people will tell
you about the seafood.

176
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,614
It's pretty impressive.

177
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:56,088
In stone towns for downey
gardens, vendors set up an

178
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,890
insane variety of
a seafood snack.

179
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:04,731
Oh, yeah, I would
love some of that.

180
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:11,637
We have shellfish, we have a

181
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:18,410
mussel small shell, a tune
tuna fish, mahi-mahi.

182
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:18,979
Good.

183
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:26,980
Let me find some of the octopus.

184
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:32,491
I like hot.

185
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:40,492
Okay, good.

186
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,001
Mmm.

187
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:43,669
I like it, chewy but tasty.

188
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,239
Lobster is working for me.

189
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,675
Too spicy for you, ma'am.

190
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:55,414
Believe me, only one of us is

191
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,983
going to be [ Bleep ] tonight.

192
00:11:56,984 --> 00:12:04,984
And it's not going to be you.

193
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:11,864
The famous Zanzibar pizza.

194
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:17,003
Awesome.

195
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:25,004
Sounds awesome to me.

196
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,783
Looks good.

197
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,384
Thank you.

198
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:32,719
Mmm.

199
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,658
Weird and wonderful.

200
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:39,827
Mmm.

201
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:41,027
These stands are extremely

202
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,162
popular with locals and visitors

203
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,165
alike, so of course the
government raised the rents.

204
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,968
One guy, Juma, decided to pick

205
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,670
up and move his place
a bit out of town.

206
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:57,309
His customers came with him.

207
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,577
This is Juma.

208
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,212
Hi, Juma.

209
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:00,914
How are you?

210
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:02,048
So what are we having?

211
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,349
Chick up and steak.

212
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,985
Half chicken and all the spices.

213
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,486
I ordered beef for now.

214
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,421
Beef is good.

215
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,422
I'll take half a chicken.

216
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,158
Chicken?

217
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,726
Yeah, sure.

218
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:18,497
Juma is famous for his chicken.

219
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:23,769
The bird is slathered with
a mixture of garlic, lime,

220
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,571
coriandor, salt and pepper and

221
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,173
grilled and served as a saw stay

222
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:31,410
or whole pieces topped
with chili sauce.

223
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,712
Preparation for this is
Saturday morning, prepare

224
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,447
cutting and then coming here at

225
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:39,018
6:30 to finish about 10:00.

226
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,987
How many guys are working here?

227
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,355
It's about six, seven of them.

228
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,291
Six or seven of them.

229
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:45,391
All around the table.

230
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,627
Wow, it's like a big operation.

231
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,130
He's finishing the skewers, I

232
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,900
guess he's half-cooking
or saucing.

233
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,502
He's re-heating,
finishing the skewers.

234
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,871
That guy doesn't just set up

235
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,439
plates for him to top with meat.

236
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,607
Then I guess they have the bread

237
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:04,076
and the sauce and
finishing to go, also.

238
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,811
What are they squirting
on the fries?

239
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:09,615
His hot sauce, ketchup.

240
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,483
So you never go hungry here.

241
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,919
There's always food
many the street.

242
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,988
If you come here to buy ten
skewers, you are eventually

243
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,656
going to buy 20 or 30 because

244
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,958
someone is always asking for

245
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,092
food and you always buy it.

246
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,827
It's just the culture.

247
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,996
You always shell out food.

248
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,965
There we go.

249
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:32,004
And you use the
stick as your fork.

250
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,173
Hot, hot, hot.

251
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,808
Where do you think the
recipe came from?

252
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,011
This is a real mixed
up history here?

253
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:43,415
Mostly Arabic/Indian components
with the spices, most

254
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,151
of the trees like mangos came

255
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,686
from India, pineapples
from Brazil.

256
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:55,687
Tamron, southeast
Asia, not even India.

257
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,664
Damn, that's good.

258
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,098
The chicken is really awesome.

259
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,968
I might need some more of this.

260
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,036
I'm liking the heat, man.

261
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:07,439
Good stuff.

262
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Incredible.

263
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,552
The 250-mile flight from

264
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,388
Zanzibar across the water to the

265
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:29,661
town of Arusha takes
an hour and a half.

266
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,863
But culturely you are flying

267
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:39,864
from Texas to the Philippines.

268
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:50,416
Kilimanjaro into whose white
peak the hero saw himself

269
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,484
disappear as he
slipped into death.

270
00:15:52,485 --> 00:16:00,485
From there we head into
the Sarang Sarangeti.

271
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:11,463
♪

272
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:24,583
The journey of this kind one
must expect an occasional

273
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:32,584
setback.

274
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:44,136
We reached the eastern edge of

275
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:52,137
the Sanghetti where it is a
significant descent to the

276
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:53,646
crater.

277
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:58,150
A long time ago the crater
collapsed on itself creating

278
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,720
this kaldera, creating
a truly lost word.

279
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:05,057
Inside the creator, an entire

280
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,826
ecosystem within an ecosystem.

281
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:12,164
Wildlife pretty much stayed put.

282
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:16,168
Coming to drink, well,
right below my place.

283
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,303
It's nice.

284
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:21,673
Very, very nice if you
find yourself here.

285
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:26,678
A hot bubble bath awaits after
a long day in the bush.

286
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,482
Perhaps a dry cherry of
a glass of decanter.

287
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,451
The next morning one rises to

288
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,487
breakfast in one's chambers
on the balcony, perhaps.

289
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:41,260
Silver service, hot coffee,
freshly baked croissant.

290
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:41,594
Good morning.

291
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,262
Thank you, sir.

292
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:43,996
You're welcome.

293
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:48,834
The rules of the house while
slightly restricting are

294
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,502
sensible enough and given the

295
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:54,005
luxurious surroundings and
the view, hardly a burden.

296
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,374
You're not supposed to wander

297
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,709
around at night here unescorted.

298
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:05,710
There's lions and hyenas
and baboons and stuff.

299
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:13,525
I heard they can get a little

300
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,827
rakey, but there were
no knocks on the door.

301
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,896
I know what you're thinking

302
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:18,731
already, you're not going to go

303
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:23,535
out there and shoot some
beautiful animal in the brain.

304
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,404
Answer?

305
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:26,138
No.

306
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,374
What kind of sick [ Bleep ]

307
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,575
Wants to shoot an elephant?

308
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,410
Even the toilet has a nice view.

309
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:36,415
This is pretty much what you see

310
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:42,087
because you're sitting
on the snakes.

311
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,722
Idyllic natural setting and

312
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:48,628
good plumbing, it's
pretty much paradise.

313
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:18,750
It's nuts driving
into the Serangeti.

314
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,093
After a short while you actually

315
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,929
get used to the jungle book

316
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:31,930
scene playing out in
front of your car.

317
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,942
It's interesting to see the

318
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:44,943
giraffe and wild beasts, zebra,

319
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,952
they all seem to pretty
much hang together.

320
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,120
The buffalos take
the big stuff out.

321
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,723
The zebras follow it down and

322
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:57,663
the wild beasts are
the closed crop.

323
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,131
My guide is a fourth generation

324
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,068
African born in Kenya, lives in

325
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,803
Tanzania and knows this area

326
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,740
like I know the Barney counter.

327
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,476
About every tree you see here

328
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:13,412
that's lying on its side has not

329
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,646
fallen over by choice, it's

330
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:22,647
being pushed over by elephants.

331
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,822
There's an elephant over there.

332
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:27,926
Oh, yeah.

333
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:28,127
Whoo!

334
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:29,261
It's a big bull.

335
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,329
Magnificent.

336
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,830
Will he charge us?

337
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:32,432
No.

338
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,334
If we piss him off?

339
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:43,335
If we piss him off he would.

340
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:57,022
They sleep so
soundly, the zebra.

341
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:57,824
You can creep right up.

342
00:20:57,825 --> 00:21:03,362
Zebras as and more zebras you
almost get bored looking at

343
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,163
them.

344
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:09,368
Giraffes look slightly irritated
to be interrupted and

345
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:12,270
stadium-sized crowds
of wild beasts.

346
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:19,177
The unkept looking
things every 100 yards.

347
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:22,080
All that's missing
is a happy sound.

348
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,383
Everyone thinks wild beasts

349
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,251
jump into the rivers, but that

350
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,819
only happens two
months of the year.

351
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,020
The rest of the year they are

352
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:29,989
trekking through the bush.

353
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,890
To me this is so much more

354
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,725
spectacular when you
see the big numbers.

355
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:37,162
You'll be in an area this
morning that was full of wild

356
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:42,568
beasts and go there this
afternoon and there's not one.

357
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:46,938
They have moved.

358
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:50,742
Thousands and thousands of
wild beasts are on their

359
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:51,711
migration everywhere.

360
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:55,881
A big circle stretched out
across Tanzania in search of

361
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:56,915
prime grazing.

362
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,283
It's all about water and grass

363
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:02,888
and a good place to make babies.

364
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,890
I mean, look at this little guy.

365
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:07,125
He's keeping up with his mom.

366
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,226
He's doing okay.

367
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,595
Within 15 minutes of being

368
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,196
born, they are up and standing.

369
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:11,598
Really.

370
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,635
Running as fast as their moms
within a couple of hours.

371
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:20,372
There's a wild beast
that didn't make it.

372
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,640
How long has it been there?

373
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,974
A day or two.

374
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,110
Very fresh.

375
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,211
You don't want to get lost here.

376
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,113
You definitely don't want to be

377
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:31,282
on foot outside your car
or injured, for instance.

378
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:36,321
Nature as they say is a cruel

379
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:39,124
miscus to take care of
its own without mercy.

380
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,959
The evidence of this cool math

381
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,128
called survival is everywhere.

382
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,295
Non-immediate family, you're not

383
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,831
going to help a brother out.

384
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:46,832
You would think, huh?

385
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:52,971
Start limping, first
come the hyenas.

386
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,974
They see the vultures dropping
and that's key to them

387
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:56,676
there's food up.

388
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:59,645
And the vultures need the hyenas

389
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:01,580
to rip open the skin
to start eating it.

390
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,248
By the time they stop ripping

391
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:06,452
out your soft parts and treating

392
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:09,020
your femur like a chew toy, they

393
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:12,323
call them the undertaker birds

394
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,159
that are waiting for their turn.

395
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,827
When I have cause to reflect on

396
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,764
a pack of hyenas ripping out the

397
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,532
guts, I think, you know what?

398
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:25,671
I could really go for
some Pesto right now.

399
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:28,640
By late day we pause for lunch.

400
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:31,176
Penne with Pesto, steamed baby

401
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:34,145
corn and snow peas, sprinkled

402
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,215
tomatoes with Parmesan
and oh look, brownies.

403
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,851
Boy, the hippos
are coming close.

404
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:46,391
Yeah, you can smell the pesto.

405
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,359
They are coming ashore.

406
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,628
Yes, Dave.

407
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,196
Over thankfully cold beers, I

408
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,731
learn who is really the most

409
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,866
dangerous animal around here.

410
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:55,367
Yeah, that's right.

411
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:57,969
Mr. Lovable funny hippo always

412
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,205
in a tutu in the cartoons.

413
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,508
A vicious, unpredictable and ape

414
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:05,143
parentally incredibly
fast moving killer.

415
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,378
You happen to leave here and

416
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,380
go to pee behind the tree here

417
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,550
and come face to face with a

418
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,652
hippo, the hippo would easily

419
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:16,387
outrun you in a big chomp, big

420
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,389
tusks that will go straight

421
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,858
through you, chop you in half.

422
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,327
Just get between them and
their mud hole and they'll be

423
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:27,499
all over you like Justin
Bieber's bodyguards.

424
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,900
It can get ugly.

425
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:35,073
What do hippo penises look like?

426
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:35,875
I don't know.

427
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:38,209
Do they ever emerge
with a big hard on?

428
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,410
Not that I've said.

429
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,180
They are under water.

430
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,248
I don't go snorkeling.

431
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,851
I find that comforting to know.

432
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:12,871
They are among the last great
warrior tribes on earth.

433
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,781
Semi-nomatic, they believe all

the cattle are a gift
from the gods to them.

435
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,885
They move with their animals

00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:22,153
across the Tanzanian planes

The Masai have strategic hamlets

444
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:57,055
designed to repel and
discourage predators.

445
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:01,359
Do you have a lot of
livestock coming in here?

446
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,963
This area is quite famous
for the cats, the big cats.

447
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:10,869
The big cats, lions,
roam free here.

448
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,705
An area called Indutut.

449
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,374
The lions are an enemy, they

450
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,944
are a competitor, but they are

451
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:25,283
also something that
they greatly admire.

Swedish native Engela Johnson

00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:31,990
with the lion project is trying

454
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:33,391
to find a balance between the

455
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,661
needs, traditions and the basic

456
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:37,328
identities of the people and the

457
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,664
outside's world's desire to

458

protect the beautiful
killing machines.

This is what can happen when a

warrior defending his cattle

461
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,905
takes on a hungry adult lion.

462
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:49,808
Nobody wants this.

463
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,844
For the Masai, being comprised

464
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,146
of the comings and goings of the

465
00:26:55,147 --> 00:27:02,420
lion population is a useful

466
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:04,322
thing, good to know in advance.

467
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,257
Respect that the Masai have

468
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,492
always defined themselves and

469
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,327
their identities
but their enemy.

A tribe of proud warriors, what

471
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:19,771
happens when there's no
one and nothing to fight?

♪

473
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,679
Engela has brought several Masai

474
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,880
onto her team to show them up

475
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:32,583
close the lions they
share this land with.

476
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,585
So often on my days out when

477
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,555
I'm working with the Masai,
you don't eat at all.

478
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,290
You get a cup of tee in the

479
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,458
morning and then if you're lucky

480
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:44,529
in the rainy season, you'll
get fresh milk or this.

481
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,299
This is Amasi, by the way, a

482

lumpy yogurt drink similar
to the Masai diet.

483
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:52,304
Cheers.

484
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:53,772
And before you say yuck, it

485
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:55,040
may be worth noting that between

486
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:58,543
their nearly 100% protein diet

487

Olympic-level Stan ma and

489
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,720
condition and can run miles at a

490
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:09,988
time without rest or water and

491
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:13,324
can basically kick your ass near

any physical contact
given half the chance.

So help yourself to some
sour lumpy goodness.

A little honey and raisins
in there, good to go.

495
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,343
It's so different here, like

496
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:35,680
the rainy season, dry season.

497
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:39,684
Such different challenges.

498
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:42,821
What do you think of
going under here?

499
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:50,822
I'm okay with it.

500
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:03,174
Currently, Engela is tracking
two lions particular.

Ramu ss and pouyo.

Do you see them?

503
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,220
Yes, I do.

504
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,889
I see them.

505
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,057
Wow.

506
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,157
Two of them.

507
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:19,859
Yeah.

508
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,359
You like them, don't you?

509
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,628
Oh, they are magnificent.

510
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:24,729
Very admirable.

511
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,999
He's a bit of a
warrior, that one.

512
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,903
Should we try to upright them?

513
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,305
Yeah.

514
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:37,308
When you go to the lions, you

515
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,743
don't ever drive
straight on them.

516
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:46,744
You kind of go in at an
angle to relax them.

517
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:52,090
That's funny how they
pretend they don't see you.

518
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:59,931
But they are so
completely aware.

519
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,567
So basically what we look at to

520
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:10,568
identify them are their spots,
like their fingerprint.

521
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,446
Punctured in the face, that
means he's fighting with a

522
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:15,882
female.

523
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:17,415
It's too dangerous to go for the

524
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,950
head area if they're fighting.

525
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,785
The reason for the colors, do

526
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,620
you see how lions behave to cope

527
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:25,123
with threats in the area, to

528
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:29,928
show that lions and Masai
can stay together.

529
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:35,433
They will always live together.

530
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:41,606
For the Masai, one of the
diminish things for them is

531
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:42,640
large ranges.

532
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:45,476
The same resource
that the lion needs.

533
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,213
If push came to show and one

534
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,248
would have to go, it wouldn't be

535
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,050
the wildlife that's bringing in

536
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:54,652
far too much for this
area of the country.

537
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,454
If they can show you they are

538
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,156
actually fundamental to protect

539
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,925
them in this area and to protect

540
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:05,263
the lions, well, then it's
the better for them as well.

541
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:13,071
And what's total population
of lions countrywide?

542
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,839
Tanzania probably has 50%

543
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,044
population for the lion,
so it's important.

544
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:23,949
And best estimates are that
there are 30,000 lions.

545
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:28,453
It's not so worrisome the
size but the rapid decrease.

546
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:31,189
We have lost large predators in

547
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,824
the world but the
world carries on.

548
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,193
There would probably be other

549
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:43,194
predators to take their place,
the hyenas, cheetahs and

550
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:44,303
leopards.

551
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:49,307
Lions are a big show of the
ecosystem that is healthy.

552
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:52,510
They are important to that.

553
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:56,614
20, 22 hours of the
day they relax.

554
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,951
So when you see sleeping cats...

555
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,287
Man, they are beautiful.

556
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:21,639
Just a few miles from the

557
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:29,640
crater's rim, the village,
about 400 Masai live here.

558
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:33,318
He's the chief, four wives, 12

559
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,919
children, a handful of woman are

560
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:40,891
old enough to be out
looking after the herds.

561
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:44,195
I was born in New Jersey
and live in New York.

562
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:44,563
Oh.

563
00:32:44,564 --> 00:32:46,864
You have a son in
New Jersey, yeah?

564
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,900
Yes, yes.

565
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:55,740
He's at one of the colleges
known as Montclair state.

566
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:59,010
Oh, sure, I know Montclair well.

567
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,045
Near where I grew up.

568
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:04,182
Oh, yes.

569
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:07,218
There's going to
be some downpours.

570
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,387
Well, do you think
it comes here?

571
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:10,388
No.

572
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,922
No.

573
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:11,623
Not us.

574
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:15,726
It's funny, like they always

575
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:19,030
know since there are no
weather reports out here.

576
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,465
They have been migrating with

577
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:21,632
the season since they came to

578
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,301
this part of Africa sometime in

579
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:27,072
the 15th century, long, long

580
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,873
before this became
a national park.

581
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:36,114
Here we run into the kind of

582
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,282
conflict that the world will see

583
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:40,751
as they value the most.

584
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,455
Parts of nature populated
with magnificent, wild but

585
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:48,993
aggressively protected animals

586
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:51,129
were the indigenous people.

587
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:58,303
So when I came here to start

588
00:33:58,304 --> 00:33:59,970
up here, they were suspicious.

589
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,005
They thought it was going to

590
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,807
lead to us being kicked out.

591
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:06,444
That's a constant
fear in this area.

592
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:10,014
Because in the past,
they kill them.

593
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:13,518
But today we stop that.

594
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,019
Or we can kill.

595
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,188
If you have no
other alternative.

596
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:17,856
Yeah.

597
00:34:17,857 --> 00:34:21,492
That's why we have a sphere.

598
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,028
We are not harmless people but

599
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,463
it is only for protection only.

600
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,433
The Masai know we are here to

601
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,834
work with them and we hope to

602
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:31,969
start the lion guardian project,

603
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,039
which basically you hire masais

604
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,376
to protect the lions
rather that kill them.

605
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:44,149
When all of the cattle the

606
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,716
Masai people have, how do you

607
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:47,885
protect them from the predators?

608
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:50,888
If you do not bother them,
they will not bother you.

609
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,690
How about when they are grazing?

610
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:55,193
When they are grazing, we
have people who follow.

611
00:34:55,194 --> 00:35:00,131
And that's enough to
discourage hyenas or lions?

612
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,499
Yes.

613
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,234
But sometimes they are happy

614
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:07,071
lion, so they are making it loud

615
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:13,911
to assure they are happy.

616
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:19,517
And they make sounds to
know they are happy.

617
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,752
And if they catch something, we

618
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:29,753
can hear very close,
only like... and stop.

619
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:35,566
And if it's a loud
that's a happy.

620
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,101
That's happy.

621
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,937
The purring noise,
that's not good.

622
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:40,706
That is not.

623
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:45,276
That's not a hear
kitty situation.

624
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,512
That's him looking for food.

625
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:48,247
Okay.

626
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:55,386
My cat ♪

627
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:57,955
okay, this, a lot of you are

628
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:01,559
going to find very disturbing.

629
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,794
I'm guessing the little goat

630
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:11,795
over there is about
to get the bad news.

631
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:16,474
Come now.

632
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,477
I try and be a good guest.

633
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,613
I eat what my hosts
put in front of me.

634
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,982
I try to take responsibility if

635
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:28,052
something dies for my dinner.

636
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:28,754
Here?

637
00:36:28,755 --> 00:36:31,656
No, no, here.

638
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:34,091
So when the chief asks if I'd

639
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,826
care to do the honors and tells

640
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:42,300
me how it has to be
done, I'm not happy.

641
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:45,403
In fact, as I close off his air

642
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:53,404
passages, I'm struggling
to not throw up on myself.

643
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:04,689
Yeah.

644
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,625
Do you know how to skin?

645
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:10,961
Maybe I can show you.

646
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,664
Go ahead.

647
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:17,167
The Masai traditionally kill

648
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,203
their goats by suffocation, for

649
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,706
very good reason, it turns out,

650
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,007
to keep the blood, which is a

651
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:29,614
vital component for the Masai

652
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:32,350
diet abundant in
the chest cavity.

653
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:40,157
Let's prepare to
take the skin out.

654
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:43,828
Oh, good.

655
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:48,899
Here now.

656
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,870
Then like this.

657
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,372
More?

658
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,741
Everything's intact, beautiful.

659
00:37:56,742 --> 00:38:00,745
So all the blood... it
filled up the cavity and

660
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:03,180
started to get coagulated.

661
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,149
Yes.

662
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,083
I get it now.

663
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:07,985
Easier now to take
the blood out.

664
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:08,520
See?

665
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:11,556
I've never seen that.

666
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:12,757
That's super cool.

667
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:17,928
Some would like to drink fresh.

668
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:25,929
Sure.

669
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,340
It's good.

670
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:29,541
♪

671
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:32,643
People, they eat this one fresh.

672
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:37,014
That's kidney.

673
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:37,849
Yeah.

674
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,617
Just a little piece.

675
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:44,755
Deed done, it's time
for a little kidney.

676
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,957
Enjoy the spoils, then party.

677
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,959
Sweet, actually, I like them

678
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,196
better like this than cooked.

679
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,373
They're smelling good.

680
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,774
That's great.

681
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:11,775
Not too much of a meat eater,
but this I kind of like.

682
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,250
♪

683
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:17,955
Even on the Serengeti, it
ain't barbecue if there ain't

684
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:18,989
some kind of beer.

685
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:25,596
Normally the Masai, they have
what you call honey beer.

686
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:30,935
You drink it just very strong.

687
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:36,941
Love to try some.

688
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:44,942
Noticed a palpable
change in the mood.

689
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:57,162
Welcome.

690
00:39:57,163 --> 00:40:04,535
Asante.

691
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:05,471
Pretty tasty.

692
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:08,372
Almost refreshing.

693
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:15,846
Like a palm wine, kind
of pulpy-like taste.

694
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:23,847
You can definitely
taste the honey.

695
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:29,126
Welcome to our culture.

696
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:32,296
Everyone has to
carry a big knife.

697
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:39,069
Many aspects of their lifestyle
and traditions remain

698
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,639
unchanged.

699
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,173
Awesome.

700
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,210
This does not mean Masai don't

701
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:50,881
have cell phones, by the way.

702
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:52,583
Everybody does.

703
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:55,686
We are talking about how can

704
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,722
we balance this, because they're

705
00:40:57,723 --> 00:40:58,889
now looking to send our children

706
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,860
to school, getting a good

707
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:07,264
education, but we still
stay a very strong culture.

708
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:10,568
So it's really a hard
time, but we continue.

709
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:11,869
That's another question, when

710
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,838
your son comes back from new

711
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,540
Jersey, you know, is your son

712
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:18,075
going to want a motorcycle?

713
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:20,511
Is he going to want a car?

714
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:22,580
A flat screen TV?

715
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:23,081
I don't know.

716
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:26,216
As you know, the children, they

717
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,052
quickly change their mind.

718
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:36,053
They may one day and
say... I don't know.

719
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:43,968
It's beautiful, this country,
this part of Africa.

720
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:46,704
Geographically huge,
but not really.

721
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:50,207
As the world and what we need to

722
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:54,579
live in it shrinks every day.

723
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,615
Who gets to live here?

724
00:41:57,616 --> 00:42:01,952
Who or what do we want to see,

725
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,122
is for better or worse
going to determine that.

726
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:08,425
Nearly $1.5 billion is spent

727
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,827
here every year by people who

728
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:15,465
come wanting to look mostly
at beautiful animals.

729
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,401
That's an amount that's hard to

730
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:25,402
argue with, and
impossible to outrun.
