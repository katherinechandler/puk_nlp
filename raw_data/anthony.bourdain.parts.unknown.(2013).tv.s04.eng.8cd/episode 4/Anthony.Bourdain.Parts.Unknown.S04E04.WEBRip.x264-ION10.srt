My spirit house.

00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:24,417

Way in central Vietnam is
some place I've never been

15
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:56,250
before.

16
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,551
But it's still Vietnam.

17
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,220
Where all the things, the

18
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:04,257
smells, the sounds, the
details, I love so much.

19
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,658
First night in country, it's

20
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:10,330
like sliding into a warm, deeply

21
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:14,934
comforting familiar bath.

22
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:19,005
I've been all over Vietnam,
a place I feel a special

23
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,039
connection to.

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,676
My first love, a place I remain,

25
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:27,680
beed soed with, fascinated by...

26
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,682
Besodded with, fascinated by.

27
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,752
So back in Vietnam, one of
my favorite places on earth.

28
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:36,389
And all of the things
I need for happiness.

29
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,594
Plastic stool, tiny little
plastic table, check.

30
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:41,895
Oh.

31
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,797
Something delicious in a bowl.

32
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:45,032
Check.

33
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:51,271
In this case a local
specialty, com hen, clam rice,

34
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,941
sweet clams out of their shells,

35
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,744
tossed with a wild swirl, beans,

36
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,946
spicy green chillies, krumpbly

37
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:03,583
roasted peanuts, fried
pork riend, and cilantro.

38
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:09,389
And a similar
variation with rices.

39
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,458
That fish sauce with chilies in

40
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,929
it, and oh, that'll just
singe your eyebrows off.

41
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,765
Chilies in.

42
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:22,769
Hit with hot clam broth,
and you're on your way.

43
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,504
I'm back.

44
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:25,772
Back in Vietnam.

45
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,975
Grin for the duration.

46
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:36,976
A giddy, silly, foolish
man beyond caring.

47
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:42,121
And a cold local beer.

48
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:50,122
My preferred brand.

49
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,633
Ah.

50
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,802
Clams with pork cracklings.

51
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:58,971
How could that not be good?

52
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,641
This is the way so many of the

53
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,344
great meals of my life
have been enjoyed.

54
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,345
Sitting in the street, eating

55
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,813
something out of a bowl that I'm

56
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:09,215
not exactly sure what it is.

57
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,819
Scooters going by.

58
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:14,622
So delicious.

59
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:17,557
I feel like an animal.

60
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:21,328
Where have you been all my life?

61
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,163
Fellow travelers, this
is what you want.

62
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:27,166
This is what you need.

63
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:35,167
This is the path to true
happiness and wisdom.

64
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,041
Located on the north and

65
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,210
south banks of the perfume river

66
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:15,548
in central Vietnam, mountains
behind, sea ahead, an

67
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:20,052
arrangement determined by
criteria both military and

68
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:20,421
spiritual.

69
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:23,956
For 143 years, way was the seat

70
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,858
of power for the dynasty which

71
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,360
ruled the entire country until

72
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,229
the late 1800s when the French

73
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,198
started taking power and
land under their control.

74
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,233
The French allow the imperial

75
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,902
throne to rule nominally the

76
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,236
center of the country, until the

77
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:41,240
end of world war ii in 1945.

78
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,075
Way has been celebrated for its

79
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,111
fantastic architectures since

80
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:53,112
the early 1800s, vast
palaces, pagodas, and tombs.

81
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,724
The center is wealth of the

82
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,492
intellectual, artists, and

83
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:06,493
spiritual life of the country.

84
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:24,810
Oh yeah, that's tempting.

85
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:31,791
Around here somewhere.

86
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,661
This is dong Ba market, and deep

87
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:38,931
inside, somewhere in
there is what I want.

88
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,101
My way of thinking, in the

89
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,970
hierarchy of delicious, Slurpee

90
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:51,971
stuff in a bowl, it
is at the very top.

91
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,149
He is an author and journalist

92
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,620
that spent much of his
childhood in hue.

93
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,688
This will be it.

94
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:02,656
This will be it.

95
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:05,792
Let's do it, man.

96
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,060
Here he creates an elaborate

97
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,996
broth of mixed bones scented

98
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:14,000
with a lemon grass, spice,
and fermented shrimp paste.

99
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,335
At the bottom, rice noodles

100
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,538
garnished, heaped with tender

101
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:24,544
slow cooked beef shank,
pig's foot, and blood cake.

102
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,713
Garnished with lime wedge,

103
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:29,015
cilantro, green onions, shredded

104
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:33,385
banana blossoms, it's a...
Blossoms, it's a wonder of

105
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,386
flavor and texture.

106
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,723
The greatest soup in the world.

107
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:40,493
Look at that, man, that
is just unbelievable.

108
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,194
Blood cake.

109
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,862
Blood cake.

110
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,831
The sauce.

111
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,866
I want to see how
much he put in there.

112
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:51,203
You have to make it look
really red in there, it has to

113
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,238
be blood red.

114
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:57,043
And the broth is wonderful.

115
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,444
People are put on earth for

116
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:03,049
various purposes, I was
put on earth to do this.

117
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,617
Eat noodles right here.

118
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,218
When I was a kid, we used to

119
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,754
tell each other, do not take a

120
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:10,723
date to go out to eat, if you

121
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,025
start sweat, your hair stick up.

122
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:13,561
Really?

123
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:15,061
I would definitely bring a date

124
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:18,030
to this, if she doesn't like
this, there's no hope of a

125
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:18,365
relationship.

126
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:19,398
Exactly.

127
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,967
If she said I don't know,

128
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:24,470
there's icy stuff in there, that

129
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:28,541
would be a relationship
of offender for me.

130
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:28,909
I'm not kidding.

131
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,210
Here you are having it
in a market like this.

132
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:37,984
She makes this place like
would be a real cuisine.

133
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:42,755
It's just sophisticated a
bowl of food as any French

134
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,056
restaurant.

135
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:48,928
It really is the, just
the top of the mountain.

136
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,630
How long has she been here?

137
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,734
She started out when she was 12.

138
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:57,770
You live in a great country,

139
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,271
man, any country that could

140
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,741
produce this is a
superpower, I'm concerned.

141
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,010
I'm getting down to
the pepper residue.

142
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,679
How long does that broth have to

143
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,249
simmer to get good?

144
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,283
An hour.

145
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,252
Wow, really?

146
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:16,088
I would have guessed
like 14 hours.

147
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:16,624
Yum.

148
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:16,924
Happy.

149
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:23,129
Nice burny feeling on my
lips, flop sweat, check.

150
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,797
Happy.

151
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:27,466
So, we can pretty much
cancel the rest of the show.

152
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,436
I've achieved the,
my happy zone.

153
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,906
It's really all down
hill from here.

154
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,733
My oldest friend in Vietnam.

155
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,803
Originally assigned to
translate, the guide, to escort,

156
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,672
and to report on me back in 2000

157
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:09,075
when I first came
to this country.

158
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,509
How are you, brother?

159
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,244
My brother.

160
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:13,880
Good to see you.

161
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:14,514
His responsibilities to his

162
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:15,715
employers have never been an

163
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,850
impediment to our friendship.

164
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,752
We meet where you pick your own

165
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:24,190
seafood out of the tank,
and you cook it yourself.

166
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,058
You really do look
exactly the same.

167
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:26,694
You look good.

168
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:27,327
Yeah?

169
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:30,830
Oh yeah.

170
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,932
No trace of time on your face.

171
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,736
My hair is white, I
have lines on my face.

172
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,504
I look completely
different in 2000.

173
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:42,374
People told me the sea food

174
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,076
is from the lagoon over here.

175
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:45,712
It is one of the biggest
ones in southeast Asia.

176
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:49,716
I'm going for some eel.

177
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,218
Season with lemon grass, green

178
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,453
chilly and pepper, drizzle with

179
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:58,357
house special sauce, grill
over charcoal and dig in.

180
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,392
I have the picture with you.

181
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,594
You have some old photos?

182
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,697
Oh, look at me, come on.

183
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,734
I look like my aunt Sonia, look

184
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:11,303
that the public I look

00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:26,191
were once part of the regal
style with slope grooves to

366
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,594
handle all the
rainy hue weather.

367
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,128
But most importantly, they

368
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,298
feature a garden at the center,

369
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:35,100
which follows the eastern
philosophy that all things

370
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,535
originate from a single source,

371
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:42,508
and expand in all directions.

372
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,345
Since the loss of her beloved
son, she's lived here.

373
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:51,783
Surrounded by her
garden and her art.

374
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:55,887
Occasionally, she invites
guests and friends.

375
00:20:55,888 --> 00:21:00,292
There's duck, writer and food

376
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:04,696
blogger, art collector,
and fi leap.

377
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,498
This is also a gallery?

378
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:13,004
Yes, I design and
my people work.

379
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,240
She also cooks, magnificently

380
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,175
from a repertoire of imperial

381
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:21,813
hue dishes numbering over 100.

382
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,715
Back in dynastic time, the

383
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:26,251
emperor ts demanded varieties in

384
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,654
wives of sometimes
over 100, and in food.

385
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:32,023
The menus of the 19th century

386
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,892
boasted new dishes every night.

387
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:38,730
Small, flavorful, and
beautifully presented.

388
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:43,435
And that cultural tradition
continues today.

389
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,870
How much of that persists?

390
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:51,209
Those imperial roots
that need for variety?

391
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:56,548
Yes, the tradition has stayed,
and it will stay forever

392
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:00,886
here to cook all these
different things all the time.

393
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:03,389
We start with bird's nest soup.

394
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,291
A delicacy to which I
am usually immune.

395
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:09,060
This one is unusually flavorful.

396
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:13,532
These are swallow's nests
from high up on cliffs.

397
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:16,735
They're soaked in water, cooked

398
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:20,906
in chicken stock, and
served with crab meat.

399
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:23,241
A symbol of purity, nobility and

400
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:28,113
Patience from a nearby lake.

401
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:28,715
Steamed.

402
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:30,616
Crab row is mixed with red

403
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:33,419
onion, pepper, and seasoning
and added to the soup.

404
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:41,420
And simmered.

405
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:53,939
The symbolic and health aspects
of many of these dishes

406
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,507
not to be overlooked.

407
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:59,578
This is fantastic.

408
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:00,112
Lovely.

409
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:04,015
How does hue differ from
the rest of Vietnam?

410
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:10,288
A wonderful architecture,
and very quiet people.

411
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,157
If you stay some time in hue,

412
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:17,163
after some day you feel
quiet, you take your time.

413
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:46,658
It is a traditional dish
that's seldom made these days

414
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:47,859
because of the complexity and

415
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,961
the time needed to do it right.

416
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,329
A fish stock is made.

417
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,199
A fish from the perfume river.

418
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,237
Pineapples, onion, chilies,
shallots, and coriander.

419
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:04,175
A salad of quickly cooked
prongs, rice noodles, ginger,

420
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,546
red chili, garlic.

421
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:14,319
Layer of rice noodle, banana
flower, then the prongs,

422
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,654
garnishes.

423
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:16,021
The strained fish stock is

424
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,023
brought to the table with the

425
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,224
salad in separate bowls and

426
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:27,225
combined just before eating.

427
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,201
Spicy for you?

428
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,704
No, it's good.

429
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:33,005
I love it.

430
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:33,873
It is very spicy.

431
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:36,542
Oh no, I like it.

432
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,877
What I found when I first came

433
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:42,447
to the this part of the
world, Vietnam particular.

434
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:46,051
My pallet changed, I need and

435
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:49,621
elevated level of
chilies and heat.

436
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:52,524
Much of Vietnamese cooking

437
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:55,727
abided by principles
of ying and Yang.

438
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:56,262
Heat and cold.

439
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:59,965
This one a lobster dish with
five spices balances the

440
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:04,570
coldness of the lobster with
the heat of the spices.

441
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:08,574
Red onion ginger, lemongrass is

442
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:09,941
added to cook the lobster.

443
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,410
Once the lobster's cooked, it's

444
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,312
presented in a bowl
of lime leaves.

445
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:20,719
And the stock is poured over it.

446
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,087
Whoa.

447
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:22,589
That's beautiful.

448
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,256
We're getting into this with
our hand, I'm guessing.

449
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:29,294
I like this.

450
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,396
Beautiful.

451
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:34,299
The winter sheer unbelievable,
it's very... here

452
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,769
is unbelievable,
very cold and wet.

453
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:45,770
That's why we have
chili to keep us warm.

454
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,616
Spoils all of with us a
succession of dishes.

455
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:51,917
But the past as it often does in

456
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:57,122
a place like this, intrudes.

457
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:00,425
Its dealt with a
lot of suffering.

458
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:04,763
The people are very
withdrawn in some ways.

459
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:09,167
Smiling, but off course as
they remember everything.

460
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:12,838
They have to remember
the war in 1968.

461
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,640
I was visiting my grandfather's

462
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:16,642
house, and I got goose bumps

463
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:18,810
because I knew during the war in

464
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:21,780
1968 lots of people were killed.

465
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:25,150
And they were buried on
all the sidewalks there.

466
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:28,654
And I'd walk around
there and I feel it.

467
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:36,655
It's dark, it's somber,
and the history is there.

468
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,032
My mom, she never wanted me

469
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:44,335
to go home after like 10:00.

470
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:49,007
She get angry if I got home
at 11:00 or something.

471
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:52,243
When I got home at 9:00.

472
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,880
I tried to go home very early.

473
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:59,517
Riding a boat along the
river, you sort of feel there

474
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,252
are things living in the water

475
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:07,159
and in the trees and in
the darkness out there.

476
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,775
Know your enemy they say.

477
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,312
Know who it is you're
facing out there.

478
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,947
Who are they?

479
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:32,450
Why do they fight?

480
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:36,254
What are they willing to endure

481
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,024
in the furtherence
of their cause.

482
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:41,059
These one would think are simple

483
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,630
questions, useful
in any conflict.

484
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,466
Meet the enemy.

485
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:48,667
Okay.

486
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,769
He was only an infant during our

487
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:58,309
nine year long war, but
his experience should be

488
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:06,310
instructive.

489
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:18,396
In 1965:00 with the united
states initiated a sustained

490
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:21,166
bombing campaign called
rolling thunder.

491
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,134
Hoping to destroy an elusive

492
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:28,740
enemy in villages like this one.

493
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,675
Vinh Moc which was less than 20

494
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:36,614
miles from marine fire bases
just south of the DMZ.

495
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:37,183
This is where he was born.

496
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:40,351
As the target of frequent
bombings, the village of Vinh

497
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,787
Moc moved underground.

498
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:46,425
Up to 100 feet down
into darkness.

499
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,433
The villagers carved over

500
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:58,169
5,000 feet of tunnels
out of the earth.

501
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,005
Creating a complex that would

502
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:01,773
house all 90 families
of Vinh Moc.

503
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,508
13 entrances and exits leading

504
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:09,380
from the inland to the beach.

505
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:13,318
Showing me through the
labyrinth.

506
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:18,623
She since moved to the
DMZ to work as a guide.

507
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,226
How did they dispose of all of

508
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:25,463
this earth at rock without
revealing the tunnels?

509
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,333
The craters, the craters were

510
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:29,235
everywhere on the landscape of

511
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:31,002
the moon, and you know, the dirt

512
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,871
of the craters are so fresh,

513
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:38,009
look new, so they
just left them there.

514
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,577
This was the maternity
ward where Todd was born.

515
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,012
Where did people sleep?

516
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,080
They have sleeping places.

517
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,749
Just like this, but smaller.

518
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,055
Two square meters only,
just enough to put a bed.

519
00:29:56,762 --> 00:30:00,665
How long did it take to build?

520
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,067
20 months of digging.

521
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:04,870
20 months of digging.

522
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:05,104
By hand.

523
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,472
The farmer dug with their tools.

524
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:07,940
Right.

525
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,107
Under the bombing.

526
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:11,442
While the bombing is going

527
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,445
on, they're down here
digging this out.

528
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,531
Wow.

529
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:37,436
How many children here?

530
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:49,148
How did they play?

531
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:55,586
So much of the time you
were in total darkness.

532
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,255
Yeah.

533
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,722
You can't see your mother.

534
00:30:57,723 --> 00:31:00,658
Some people say that even

535
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,627
when the parents, you know, fit

536
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,829
the children, they need to touch

537
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,500
their face and find their
mouth and feed them.

538
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,669
Wow.

539
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,272
Children played here.

540
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,007
But people also emerged from

541
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:18,977
these tunnels to kill
or cripple Americans.

542
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:24,315
To shoot them, to plant Bobby

543
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:27,118
traps, and that's what
they did... booby traps.

544
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,186
And that's what they did.

545
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:34,926
Six years in darkness.

546
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:38,496
And at the end of the war, the

547
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:41,766
people of Vinh Moc emerged
from the darkness.

548
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:49,767
And what did they do?

549
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,726
What was that like after living

550
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:09,995
in darkness for so long?

551
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,729
What was it like to come out and

552
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,734
be able to spend the rest
of his life in the sun?

553
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:50,401
Thank you, wow, ready.

554

Thank you.

555

556
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:55,774
Good.

557
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:56,542
Good?

558
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:57,176
Yeah.

559
00:32:57,177 --> 00:33:00,345
Really?

560
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,446
Yes.

561
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,881
Last question, hypothetical,

562
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,716
if the French or the Japanese,

563
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:10,388
or the Americans, suddenly
decided they wanted for some

564
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,691

would he fight?

565
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:30,541
That's different.

566
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,945
They're all welcome
if they're tourists.

567
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:50,796

568

up in rice country.

569

571

catch in the early mist.

573
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:47,678
I'm meeting up for a
tasty afternoon snack.

574
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,620
It is set back from a quiet Lane

575
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,656
in the outskirts of town.

576
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:58,496
It's a neighborhood place
specializing in this.

577
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:00,465
Little pancake-like things made

578
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:03,067
of rice flour, steamed in molds,

579
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:06,304
and topped with crispy fried

580
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:11,075
shallots and crumbled
fried shrimp.

581
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:14,312
Show me how you eat this.

582
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,647
I have this when I
was a little girl.

583
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,749
So you try to pick
it up like this.

584
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,318
Right.

585
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:20,085
I got it.

586
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:22,487
Just cut around the edge here.

587
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:24,655
I feel so clumsy.

588
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,725

589
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:32,830
Fold it over.

590

This is great.

592

This is so nostalgic to me.

593
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:51,516
I will sit there in front
of our house... waiting.

594
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:55,953
Waiting for her, with a dish,
she would come and my mom

595
00:35:55,954 --> 00:36:00,291
would buy for me.

596
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:03,194
At the end of the day,
we see who eat the most.

597
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:07,398
Good, glad I'm fitting in here.

598
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,468
What do they have
in the banana leaf?

599
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,370
Are we having one of those too?

600
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,205
We have everything.

601
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,707
I don't want to
leave anything out.

602
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,377
It's made of tap yolka with

603
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:21,812
pork and shrimp from the lagoon,

604
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:26,551
wrapped like a tamale in
banana leaf, then steamed.

605
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:31,121
So, you can open.

606
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,392
In Vietnam, we learn how
to unwrap the thing.

607
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,561
So unwrap with these.

608

In a past life.

614

So this is shrimp.

615
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:59,950
Pick it up and dip.

616
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,252
Hmm.

617
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:00,786

You can see what's inside.

621
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:11,362
You call this type
of eating an-choi.

622
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:14,098
It's like for fun or playing.

623

Yeah.

625
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:22,607
So it's not a main meal.

626
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:23,041
It's for snacking.

627
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:26,844
Sticky rice dumplings.

628
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:30,781
Started with frying the
paste in cooking oil.

629
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:35,119
Then unpeeled shrimp are
stuffed into dough.

630
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,388
Place the chewy part with the

631
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:41,292
crunchy part and sprinkle
with chopped, fried shrimp.

632
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:44,194
Oh, wow, that is awesome.

633
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,896

634
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,898
Rice base.
