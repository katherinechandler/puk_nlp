Certainly a degree of freedom.

659
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:54,231
As someone who's
born and raised here,

660
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:55,992
you can definitely feel a change

661
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:57,717
in the last five to ten years.

662
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:00,617
And what we are trying to do
with our music

663
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,895
is to address
that sort of change.

664
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,932
Are you able

665
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:06,174

- Yeah.
- In ten years?

667
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:09,384
I don't know.
Right now, yes.

668
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,799
Say what you want.

669
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,070
You are actually allowed
to play music.

670
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:13,699
You're allowed to do
whatever you want.

671
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,114
But there's no venue.

672
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:16,944
There's no space
for you to practice.

673
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:20,016
I think this is how
the society is limiting

674
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,225

00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:24,365

Whatever your feelings
about how things are going,

677
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:28,887
some things are a constant,

678
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:31,717
a comfort, a birthright.

679
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:33,546
Like egg custard buns.

680
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,583
Egg yolks,
sweetened condensed milk.

681
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:37,826
When steamed,
the custard returns

682
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:39,621
to more molten form.

683
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:40,933
Braised chicken feet.

684
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:42,555

685
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,143

00:31:44,178 --> 00:31:47,250
before being finished
in the steamer.

687
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:48,803
Is it possible to make a living

688
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:50,460
playing your kind of music?

689
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:51,737
- No.
- Impossible.

690
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:53,049
- No.
- Hence the day job.

691
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,051
Hence the day job.

692
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:57,398
Actually, Hong Kong is a society

693
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:00,573
that really values
elitism and professionalism.

694
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:03,059
- Right.
- But in a way that, um,

695
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:05,337
we are seeing
even these standards

696
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:07,132
are falling apart
within the system.

697
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,582
But it's important
to be part of a system

698
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:11,067
to make any changes at all.

699
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:12,171
- Right.
- Because,

700
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:13,269
if you just stay on the fringe,

701
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:14,863
it's very hard to get people

702
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:16,935
to listen to you.

703
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:23,148
What do young people want
in Hong Kong?

704
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:25,253
Are they different
than the generation before?

705
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:27,669
Or are they ready
to think about stuff

706
00:32:27,704 --> 00:32:28,774
and get angry?

707
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:29,982
I think that society itself

708
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:32,088
is projecting
a really unhealthy image

709
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:33,882
of what young people
should be like.

710
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,712
Because there's always a model

711
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,956
of what the successful life is,

712
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,440
which is to get a house by 30,

713
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:41,960
have a family,
that sort of thing.

714
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:44,307
It's not like you can
actually change anything.

715
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:46,274
It's quite
a pessimistic thing to say,

716
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,345
but it's...
It's more about doing things

717
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,554

Only seven months?

- Yeah, yeah.
- So this is your new baby.

757
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:35,333
It was a little bit
more reflection

758
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,376
about being Chinese.
Like, how do I be modern

759
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:39,620
but not lose the soul of it?

760
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:40,897
Now, how important...

761
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,555
And I should be asking...
I should be asking you this...

762
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:46,213
Feng shui is something
I know nothing about.

763
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:47,904
When you moved into the space,

764
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,975
did you consult?

765
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:51,839
- She's my friend, yeah.
- I was guessing.

766
00:35:51,873 --> 00:35:53,185
She's my friend.

767
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,187
Feng shui is just
the environment

768
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:57,569
and the relationship
between the environment

769
00:35:57,603 --> 00:35:58,811
and the people.

770
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:00,330
When you're in a restaurant,

771
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:03,333
when you're eating the food,
the space matters.

772
00:36:03,368 --> 00:36:04,714
It...

773
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:07,199
It changes the way
you taste the food.

774
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:14,068
So when you look at this space,

775
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:17,313
what are you looking for
and what do you do?

776
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:19,038
There's a couple things.

777
00:36:19,073 --> 00:36:21,317
So number one is,
I use a compass.

778
00:36:21,351 --> 00:36:24,354
So we're northeast, southwest.

779
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:26,322
So from there,
we have a formula,

780
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:29,221
and then that will tell us
where the best chi is.

781
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,050
- What is chi?
- The energy

782
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:34,675
that are given off
by the universe.

783
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:38,851
So I look around,
and I see the colors

784
00:36:38,886 --> 00:36:41,751
of the decorations
and how the furnitures are.

785
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:45,927

00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,239
don't do it so much anymore,

804
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:23,275
because it's such
an old-fashioned dish.

805
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,794
So we want to make it
cool again.

806

812
00:37:35,874 --> 00:37:37,255
Again, this would feel

813
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,740
like a very traditional
Cantonese dish.

814
