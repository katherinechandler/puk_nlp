What's changed as far as...

186
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:06,037
the way that... I'm going to try
to pronounce it correctly...

187

Newfendlers...

188
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:08,522
Newfoundlanders.

189
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:11,525
Newfoundlanders see themselves?

190
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,389
I mean, something seems
to be happening here

191
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:20,810
as far as people here beginning
to value their own products,

192
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:22,329
their own traditional food ways.

193
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:24,055
Yeah.

194
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,401
That's a big change,

195
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:27,817
and it's something that
Jeremy Charles, for instance,

196
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:29,578
has been doing
very, very, very successfully.

197
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,165
How important is that?

198
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,754
I think the one thing
that has kept people here

199
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,515
in the wake
of the fisheries collapse...

200
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,207
Like the fish moratorium
in 1992,

201
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:39,519
so many people left.

202
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,244
And what really
has kept people here

203
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,763
is that sense of tradition.

204
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:44,454
I think sometimes
there's this idea

205
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,836
that tradition is static,
and that isn't necessarily true.

206
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:48,037
Tradition is always
kind of changing

in response to the environment.

208
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:52,248
And people choose the things
that they're passionate about,

209
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:54,119
and they find a way
to make that work.

210
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:56,570
And I think Newfoundlanders
have always had that tradition

211
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:59,021
of making do

You know, we have this
kind of complex relationship

223
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,775
here in Newfoundland
with the rest of Canada.

224
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:32,882
You know, we're a very old
British colony here,

225

but we've only really been
part of Canada since 1949.

226
00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:38,578
And I think for a long time,
on the mainland of Canada,

227
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,960
there was kind of this
stereotype of Newfoundlanders

228
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:44,342
as being, you know,
poor and uneducated,

229
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,793

And over the past 10, 20 years,

232
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,143
there's been a real shift

233
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:55,180
in how the rest of Canada
perceives Newfoundland

234
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:56,630

perceive themselves.

you can do that.

537
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:27,673
Heart of caribou tartar

538
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:29,640
with Adler and chanterelle.

539
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:31,159
I'm enjoying this meal.

540
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:32,229
Yeah, man, it's...

541
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,368
Very, very, very much.

542
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:34,611
This is really, really good.

543
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:36,164
Jeremy Charles, in my opinion,

544
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:39,685
honestly, I would say
easily top chef in Canada,

545
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:41,203
most likely, you know?

546
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:46,623
As a model of bravery,
determination, courage, pride.

547
00:24:46,657 --> 00:24:48,694
And not a false note.

548
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:53,008
We've not had anything
that's not from this island.

549
00:24:54,182 --> 00:24:56,736
What we got here
is the cod sound.

550
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:59,152
It's the swim bladder
of the codfish.

551
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:01,154
Just goes right up the middle
of the fish.

552
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:03,985
We've been toying around
with this for a long time.

553
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,195
This is almost like
boot leather, you know?

554
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:08,403
It's really, really tough.

555
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:10,681
So we'll salt it overnight.

556
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:14,098
Then we'll soak it,
and then we'll dehydrate it.

557
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:16,238
And this is the part
of you're left with.

558
00:25:16,273 --> 00:25:19,897
It's almost like a chicharrón
type of texture, you know?

559
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:21,416
But my grandmother,
she'd probably just

560
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,107
render up pork fat scrunchions,

561
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:25,903
and they just fry these off,
you know?

562
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:31,012
So what we'll do then is,
we'll drop that in the oil.

563
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:34,049
And it's gonna puff up,
become this beautiful chip.

564
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:44,853
Charred whelk with [indistinct]

565
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:47,097
And crispy cod sounds.

566
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:53,586
What was this?
Sound, floating bladder.

567
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,208
Bladder.
Yeah, I like that.

568
00:25:55,243 --> 00:25:56,451
Mmm, good.
Bladder.

569
00:25:56,485 --> 00:25:57,763

- Fried bladder.

Cod fillet

574

partridge profiteroles,

575
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:15,470
and this, the classic
Newfoundland staple,

576
00:26:15,504 --> 00:26:18,749
Jiggs dinner,
reinvented into a pasta dish.

577
00:26:18,784 --> 00:26:20,993
It's beautiful.
Oh, it's good.

578
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:22,097
Mmm.

579

580

I'm alarmed.

595

to settled here

892
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:54,005
and to catch the fish,
sell the fish,

893
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:56,221
trade the fish
all around the world

894
00:39:56,255 --> 00:39:57,774
as a means of survival.

895
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:00,398
And one place in particular
that we traded with

896
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:01,571
was with Jamaica,

897
00:40:01,606 --> 00:40:04,091
'cause in Jamaica,
they make rum,

898
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,058
and we loved rum.

899
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,440
We loved it so much

900
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:09,641
that we would actually get
on that wharf,

901
00:40:09,648 --> 00:40:11,167
and we'd kiss the fish good-bye,

902
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:13,756
knowing that it was coming back
to us in the way of rum.

903
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,793
So in keeping with that time
and honored tradition,

904
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:19,762
I do have a little buddy
for you to meet.

905
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,730
It's a Gremlin.

906
00:40:22,765 --> 00:40:27,079
This is a real Newfoundland
codfish.

907
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:28,764
Given the chance, this fish
could have grown up

908
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:30,911
to the height of 6 feet tall

909
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:32,809
and weighed as much
as 130 pounds.

910
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:34,604
This fish won't grow
any more than this,

911
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,192
because it's dead.

912
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:39,954
I do need you all to pucker up

913
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:41,818
and give this fish
a little kiss.

914
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,337
Excellent.
Fred, there we go.

915
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:44,580
On the lips?

916
00:40:44,614 --> 00:40:45,960
You're best
to go first and last.

917
00:40:45,995 --> 00:40:48,169
And by Jesus, keep
that tongue in your mouth.

918
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:50,965
Did you name your fish Valtrex?

919
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,208
I will now.

920
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,106
You were just in a strip club,
though, right?

921
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:55,176
Were you... were you...

922
00:40:56,315 --> 00:40:57,627
Where did you put that mouth?

923
00:40:57,662 --> 00:40:59,940
Tony, you can't catch it twice.

924
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:05,670
Oh, here, me darling.

925
00:41:05,704 --> 00:41:07,361
Oh, my God, Vince.

926
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:08,776
Come on, love.
Lick up.

927
00:41:08,811 --> 00:41:11,020
This is like an aphrodisiac
for you two.

928
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,608
Okay!

929
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:14,851
And we can't have a drink
without having a toast,

930
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:16,784
so please wait till
everybody gets their shot,

931
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:18,372
and we'll do it together.

932
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,615
Okay.

933
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:22,134
So here's to health
and your company

934
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:23,619
and one for the lasses.

935
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:25,793
Let's drink and be merry
all out of our glasses.

936
00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:28,002
Let's drink and be merry,
bad thoughts to refrain,

937
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:30,384
for we may or may not
ever all be here again.

938
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:31,534
Up to the lips.
Over the gums.

939
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:33,145
Look out, gullet.
Here she comes.

940
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,148
Flush her back.

941
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:42,396
Okay, now I now declare you all
honorary Newfoundlanders.

942
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,811
