1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,860
You think animals are sentient?

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,690
I think pain is, you know...

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,100
- Pain...
- Pain is pain.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,410
If you don't respond to that,

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,753
you're doing something
seriously wrong.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,240
That's very Buddhist of you,
I think.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,110
Look, when I worked in Cape Cod,

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,730
my job was to load
this steamer with lobsters.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,600
And they don't scream,
but, you know,

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,120
you hear them scratching
against the thing.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,453
I'd have dreams, and, I mean,
I'm in a sauna

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,880
and I look through the window

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,013
and there's this giant lobster,

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,290
like a... you know, a bib
with a chef on it, you know.

25
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,150
Bhutan,

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,360
a remote,
relatively rarely visited

27
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,840
kingdom of myth and legend
high in the Himalayas,

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,880
known as
Land of the Thunder Dragon.

29
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,860
One of the reasons it's not
on the tourist trail

30
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,380
is it's hard to get to.

31
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,290
Flying in,
you hang on to your seat

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,320
as the plane negotiates
some alarming maneuvers

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,530
through narrow
mountain passes...

34
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,850
Before dropping
into the country's

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,710
only international airport,

36
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,640
said by some to be the most
dangerous in the world.

37
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,360
Located between India and Tibet,

38
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,330
Bhutan, about the size
of Switzerland,

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,330
is caught between
the old world and the new.

40
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,680
Thimphu is Bhutan's capital
and largest city.

41
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,450
It has a rapidly growing
population of 100,000,

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,860
as Bhutanese have begun
the inevitable move away

43
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,040
from a rural,
agrarian lifestyle.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,460
Tourism was only allowed
starting in the 1970s.

45
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,570
The amount of foreign visitors
each year is strictly limited

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,740
to protect Bhutan's culture
and environment.

47
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,470
There are no Starbucks,
no KFCs, no King or Clown.

48
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,790
Basically, they don't
want you to come here...

49
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
at least en masse.

50
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,070
- Watch your head.
- Yeah, right? Wow.

51
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,413
What do you think of
the altitude? How you feeling?

52
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,070
I'm here because of this guy,

53
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,280
my friend, a film director,
Darren Aronofsky,

54
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,490
fresh off the unjustifiably
horrified reaction

55
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,640
to what I think is
his masterpiece, "Mother!"

56
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,500
I don't know if you've studied
the effects of high altitude.

57
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,740
You know, your blood
gets thicker and thicker

58
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,780
until it's like
freakin' marmalade.

59
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,750
- All right.
- We'll be dying slowly.

60
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,100
Awesome.

61
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,620
"Mother!" is an angry
and thinly veiled warning

62
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,100
that we are destroying
our planet.

63
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,970
And, policy wise,
Bhutan is something

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,310
of an environmental wonderland.

65
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,830
You want to protect the country
from being overly influenced

66
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,420
by foreign values,
culture, you know,

67
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,460
all of the bad stuff
that happens with tourism.

68
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,770
Has anyone made a film here?
I don't know.

69
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,460
It's got to be hard
to work here.

70
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,460
Yeah, plus talk
about contaminating

71
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,153
the values of a local culture,
I mean, I don't... that'll...

72
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,737
What, we are... Hollywood
doesn't do that.

73
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,680
Our first meal
becomes our go-to favorite

74
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,340
for the rest of the trip.

75
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,060
If I'm not on camera,
chances are I'm somewhere

76
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,890
eating these bad boys.

77
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,410
- Momo!
- Momos.

78
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,830
Plump, flavorful,
often quite spicy dumplings

79
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,630
filled with meat, cheese,
or veg.

80
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,390
Did I mention Darren
is a vegetarian?

81
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,840
- God damn, these are good.
- They are really good.

82
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,080
- Try chili cheese momo?
- Pardon?

83
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,880
- Chili cheese momo.
- Cheese momo?

84
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,540
- Chili cheese.
- Hot, very hot.

85
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,360
- Wow, everybody's smiling.
- The thing to do.

86
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,570
- Okay.
- All right, here we go.

87
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,820
- Mmm.
- That's excellent.

88
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,820
Yeah.

89
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,380
That's spicy.

90
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,613
That is... yeah,
I'm feeling that.

91
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,900
Mmm. I feel it
in the back of my head.

92
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,420
It's enlightenment.

93
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,000
It's your third eye
opening, man.

94
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,513
I can't even tell what
we're talking about,

95
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,590
I'm, like, so high
from the altitude.

96
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,720
Morning in Bhutan's capital.

97
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,620
A kingdom
that has existed contentedly

98
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,860
in a state of self-imposed
isolation for centuries.

99
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,560
In some forms of Buddhism
you're very much...

100
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,700
This life does not matter
at all, it's about the next.

101
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,050
Next.

102
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,113
But on the other extreme,

103
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,570
it's all about today, right now.

104
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,570
The form of Buddhism practiced
here is the Middle Path.

105
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,580
Middle Path.
Mahayana Buddhism.

106
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,550
Buddhists consider
the next life.

107
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,890
Yes, and always is your karma.

108
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,450
And karma.

109
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,730
Whatever tragedies fall on you,

110
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,660
that's the family of karma.

111
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,590
It's all about an attitude,
pick up and move on.

112
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,190
Once, his holiness
the Dalai Lama

113
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,260
told me, "Every day
when you rise up",

114
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,610
"you try and be a good
a human being as possible.

115
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,610
That more important
than being religious."

116
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,510
- Beautiful day today.
- Winter days...

117
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,130
- Yeah.
- Are normally like this

118
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,540
every day.

119
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,913
In the good old days,
we used to have

120
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,960
snowfalls about four,
five times a year.

121
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,790
- Mm-hmm.
- But over the last decade

122
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,210
or so, it's decreased a lot.
Noticeably, really?

123
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,040
Some glacier lakes have
disappeared completely.

124
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,520
Dasho Benji Dorji is known as

125
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Bhutan's godfather
of environmental conservation.

126
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,530
And in Tantric Buddhism,
is there a respect for nature?

127
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,080
- There is a lot of respect.
- You don't mess with nature.

128
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,640
Yeah, you don't
mess with nature.

129
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,570
This is a traditional
welcome drink, is an ara.

130
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,990
It's raw alcohol.

131
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,330
The normal toast
is "tashi delek."

132
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,820
- Tashi delek.
- Tashi delek.

133
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,060
May good fortune be with you.

134
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,030
I'm a retired alcoholic,
so I will not join you.

135
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,340
Okay. Mmm.

136
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,760
- Pretty good.
- Yeah.

137
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,590
Kind of a warm sake
but made out of wheat.

138
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,000
- Yeah.
- Yes.

139
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
If you could tell us
a little more about the chef.

140
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,700
Oh, she and her husband
are both colonels

141
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,110
in the Royal Bhutan Police.
Oh, wow.

142
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,740
We have to use the finger.

143
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,570
Touch, so that
the flavors come out.

144
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,570
These recipes,
where do they come from?

145
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,360
They come from the farms,
from all the local houses.

146
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,780
Just passed down.

147
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,710
These nine grains
have a very historical

148
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,370
and spiritual significance.

149
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,130
There was one saint
called Drukpa Kunley,

150
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,100
he's known as the Madman.
The Divine Madman.

151
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,270
Yes, of course.

152
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,380
So when he came to Bhutan,
he carried the nine grains.

153
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,870
This is the hide, the yak hide.
Mm. Yes.

154
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,730
Hot Sichuan pepper.

155
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,220
Lots of tomatoes
to tone down the pepper.

156
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,050
This is the yak hide.

157
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,780
It's a delicacy.

158
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,920
♪

159
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,780
And then this is... the green
one is the orchid flower.

160
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,130
- Oh...
- I always think

161
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,060
it's very exotic, the orchid.
Mm.

162
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,650
They say it's good
for your health.

163
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,310
- Mmm, good.
- I know, it's really amazing.

164
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,930
Can you tell us about

165
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,690
the famous
Gross National Happiness?

166
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,420
Ah, well, you have
in your Constitution

167
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,313
the pursuit of happiness,
the right of every individual.

168
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,350
It's true.
Yeah, but, we don't...

169
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,800
We don't actually believe that,
but please proceed.

170
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,430
I do believe in
Gross National Happiness.

171
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,640
Good governance, human rights,

172
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,610
justice for all,
education, health.

173
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,300
It is not a wealthy country.

174
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,160

I always do my very best

199
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,410
to be respectful and restrained,

200
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,280

God, give me strength,

207
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm trying to be respectful

208
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,890
of a five-century
religious tradition here.

209
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,060
For centuries, Bhutan
has celebrated

210
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,510
the, um... phallus.

211
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,240
Uh, I'm not sure
about the teeth.

212
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,110
This is the necklace ones.
Ooh.

213
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,525
I'm trying to think
of a circumstance

214
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,933
that you could wear
that around your neck.

215
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,320
You see them everywhere here.

216
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,910
Ah, jeez, it's a cock-alanche.

217
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,980
You could make a chess set
out of them, though.

218
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,500
Really, my dick
takes your schnatz.

219
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,980
Exactly.

220
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,353
Yeah, that's a little...
Yeah, that's...

221
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,850
That's making a statement
of some...

222
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,850
Yeah, it is. It is.

223
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,440
All right, I got to go

Rainbow dick.
Five, six...

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,860
I want to see this appearing
on the budget, by the way.

227
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,310
Exactly.
How do you write this off?

228
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,520
Do I add a little tip?
N-

229
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,380
- Do we have a bag?

230
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,413
Can I pass this along?
I'm not walking around with it.

231
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,280
I mean, I'm holding two...

232
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,010
It's... I feel like I'm...
So what do they-

233
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,940
Tell me what they represent.

234
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,390
Uh, embarrassment?
All right.

235
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,500
All this is the legacy
of Drukpa Kunley,

236
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,990
a lama and holy man
who lived 500 years ago

237
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,020
and spread the tenets
of Buddhism

238
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,850
along with a healthy skepticism

239
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,130
for the institutions of power.

240
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,070
We are sitting just below
the Chimi Lhakhang

241
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,590
which is a temple built
in the honor of Drukpa Kunley.

242
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,000
The temple's also known
as the Temple of Fertility.

243
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,970
He reveled unapologetically
in casual sex,

244
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,870
the copious use of spirits,
and seduction,

245
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,530
smiting demons
and making frequent friends

246
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,050
with what is referred to

247
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,530
as his Flaming Thunderbolt
of Wisdom,

248
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,980
which is a term you and I
are unlikely to get away with.

249
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,920
People from all over
the world come here

250
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,880
to buy wooden penises...
Yeah.

251
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,633
And to hear the stories
of the Divine Madman.

252
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,433
And to get the, yeah,
blessings from the palace.

253
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,890
The Phallus Palace.
Phallus Palace.

254
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,410
They bless you with a phallus?
With a phallus, yeah.

255
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,420
Kunga Tenzin Dorji is
a journalist and radio host

256
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,070
who knows a few things
about the Divine Madman.

257
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,700
The phallus has been
a symbol in Vajrayana Buddhism

258
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,560
long before Drukpa Kunley
came around.

259
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,600
It's just that because
he was such a character,

260
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,980
it's come
to be associated with him.

261
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,910
The Divine Madman was a rebel.

262
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,430
Questioned his own religion.
Mmhmm.

263
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,090
His own... his fellow monks.

264
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,540
So the monks hated him,
of course,

265
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,400
but then the establishment
hated him.

266
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,090
But the people took readily
to him

267
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,100
because he was a guy
who came to your house.

268
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,100
It didn't mean that,
you know, like other monks,

269
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,100
you had to prepare
a special meal for him.

270
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,620
He probably wanted, you know,
your latest batch of ara,

271
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,280
you know, the local rice wine.

272
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,450
And maybe he'd hit
on your daughter

273
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,450
and your wife as well,
in the process.

274
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,653
So you could imagine
in 16th-century Bhutan,

275
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,110
a person who was known
to have performed miracles

276
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,980
would strike
the fancy of anyone.

277
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,150
- Mm-hmm.
- What were his miracles?

278
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,950
Well, things like
shooting an arrow

279
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,090
all the way from Tibet
and landed in a house

280
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,500
that's about a few
kilometers from here.

281
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,060
- But he did exist, right?
- Yeah.

282
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,090
Then the first thing he did
when he got to the house

283
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,680
where the arrow had landed
was to hit up

284
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,480
on the lady of the house.
Mmhmm.

285
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,410
Yeah, that wouldn't fly
these days.

286
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,240
This is one of
the most difficult things

287
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,100
to understand
about Drukpa Kunley,

288
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,490
because he breaks our own... our...

289
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,250
Our notions about what is right
and what's proper.

290
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,150
This man was essentially saying,

291
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,460
"We should make love."
True.

292
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,080
"We should drink.
We should feel pleasure."

293
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,010
Oh, well, not necessarily that.

294
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,523
I think what he was trying
to say is that,

295
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,050
you know, all these things
that you hold dear

296
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,633
to your heart such as,
you know, your wife

297
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,440
and your kids and your house
and all of this,

298
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,300
in the end,
it doesn't really matter.

299
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,340
So you're saying
the Divine Madman was bringing

300
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,030
people towards enlightenment.
Yes.

301
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,720
So should I be
getting drunk more

302
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,480
and having more casual sex?

303
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,070
Will I be more enlightened?
No, not just because of that.

304
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,520
I'm sure not.

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,280
You know, obviously there's
a lot of destruction.

347
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
It will stop some of the fishes

348
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,630
from migrating up and down.

349
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,353
You're also talking about
a lot of transmission lines.

350
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,120
But, obviously, for Bhutan,

351
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,640
I think when we started on

352
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,183
the path of development,
I think we were left

353
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,610
with few other options.

354
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,810
And I think this was
the best thing for us to do.

355
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,580
The water that comes
through this dam,

356
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,300
is it an inexhaustible supply?

357
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,820
- It's all glacial water.
- We hope so.

358
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,620
There are many studies
which are showing

359
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,650
that the Himalayan glaciers
will disappear

360
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,140
in about 50 to 60 years.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

361

Yeah.

Are we talking about
the difference

365
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,800
between 50 years and 100 years,

366
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,693
or are we talking about whether
it's happening at all?

367
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,523
No, it is happening.
There's no doubt about it.

368
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,453

- And you're not only talking

369

you're also talking

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,780
Wow, close.

702
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,780
What's interesting
is the other team

703
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,950
is often standing by the target,

704
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,020
and hanging out looking cool
for as long as possible

705
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,230
as an arrow flies
in your general direction

706
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,610
is standard practice.

707
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,340
Yeah, yeah!

708
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,930
Whoo!

709
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,690
When points are scored,
there's singing and dancing

710
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,630
and a fair amount of
what can only be called

711
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,730
playful taunting.

712
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,390
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

713
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,600
The Bhutanese version
of "In your face!"

714
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,050
Brag dance.

715
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,540
- They're drinking that.
- Yeah.

716
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,610
What could possibly go wrong?

717
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,790

Why?

726
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,843
- So they're anti-cheerleaders.
- Yes.

What are they saying, though?

728
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,860
Oh, the short guy,
he can't hit, so...
