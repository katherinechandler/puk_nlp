and a present-day
political reality

31
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:20,485
103 years after what just about
anyone would call genocide.

32
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,213
Turkey has always

37
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:40,988
a cultural touchstone
and a constant reminder

38
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:44,474
of what was done
on the other side.

39
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,343
Think of Armenia,
and chances are

40
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:53,759
you think instead
of an Armenian,

41
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:58,074
maybe someone you know
or maybe someone on TV.

42
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:01,595
These guys, for instance,
famous Armenians.

43
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,838
We needed an Armenian.

44
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:06,841
I needed an Armenian
to push me over the edge,

45
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,326
help me find a window,

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,224
a lens with which
to look at a country

47
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,951
which, for some reason,
I'd managed to not visit

48
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,780
on my travels.

49
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:16,782
Then, this guy reached out...

50
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:20,441
Serj Tankian, front man
for the Armenian-American band

51
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:22,581
System of a Down.

52
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:26,344
And the whole thing
started to fall into place.

53
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:30,279
Serj first visited Armenia
17 years ago.

54
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:32,384
Since then, he's performed
a number of shows,

55
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:34,386
including one
with System of a Down

56
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:38,252
during the centennial
of the Armenian genocide.

57
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:39,978
We meet up at Dolmama,

58
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,600
his favorite restaurant
in Yerevan,

59
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:45,294
and right away I identify
a potential problem.

60
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:47,088
Well, my first question is:

61
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:48,987
I understand you're
a pescatarian?

62
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,472
- Yeah.
- How does one...

63
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:54,234
You're like,
"What the fuck are you doing?"

64
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,649
This is a land-locked country

65
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:57,961
in the heart of, like,
meat on a stick zone.

66
00:03:57,996 --> 00:03:59,998
Well, I'm interested to see

67
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,682
how you navigate your way
through this week.

68
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:05,175
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, we've got amazing trout.

69
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,005
And lots of great veggies.

70
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,731
I'm just busting your balls.

71
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:10,905
Of course you are.

72
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,907
So how Armenian are you?
I mean...

73
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,005
That's a really good question.

74
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:15,427
You were born in...

75
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,326
Yeah, I was born in Beirut,
grew up in I.A.

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,294
I'm Armenian by culture.
Both my parents are Armenian.

77
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,022
My grandparents, you know,
ended up in Syria and Lebanon

78
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,610
because of the genocide.

79
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:26,956
And how Armenian am I?

80
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,785
That's a really
good question, man.

81
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,167
The majority of Armenians
that live in the Diaspora

82
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:32,686
didn't voluntarily migrate.

83
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,171
You know, they were...
They were forced migrations,

84
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:37,449
pogroms, you know,
after the genocide.

85
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,064
So they ended up
in the Middle East and Europe

86
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,694
and different parts
of the world.

87
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:44,698
So, we have this kind
of feeling of being kicked out,

88
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:48,046
and that longing is different
than other diasporas I think

89
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,703
because of that.

90
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:52,153
Diaspora Armenian communities,

91
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:54,328
wherever they are,
have been held together

92
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:56,330
by deep feelings of nationalism

93
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,470
and injustice
for what happened to them

94
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:03,372
and how the world
refused to acknowledge it.

95
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:05,477
Dolmama specializes
in modern versions

96
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:08,238
of Armenian classic dishes.

97
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:10,344
Khashlama, a braised lamb shank

98
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,312
served with rice pilaf.

99
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,141
It's a big little snack.

100
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,901
That is a leg of...

101
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:18,904
a leg of lamb,
a little guy, yes.

102
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,906
Yeah.

103
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:23,737
Wow. It's pretty too.

104
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:26,705
So manti is like
my grandmother used to make it,

105
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,466
but it looks completely
different than this

106
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,226
because this is
vegetarian manti.

107
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,368
They're like little boats
with spices and onions.

108
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:37,198
You probably thank
Genghis Khan for this.

109
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,579
The dumplings.

110
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:40,270
He made it happen.

111
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,300
He took all the manuscripts,
killed a million people but...

112
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,827
- But he left you dumplings.
- He left... yeah.

113
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,036
Mmm, that's awesome.

114
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,038
Yeah, this is what
my soul needed.

115
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:51,903
Good.

116
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:54,423
What was it like
coming back the first time?

117
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:56,286
And how old were you,
and what was it like?

118
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,909
I had a mystical connection

119
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,428
because I had never been
to Armenia.

120
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:01,775
And we had only read about it
in books per se, you know.

121
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:04,191
Modern Armenia is different

122
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,538
than what I had thought of,
you know,

123
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:09,438
because it's thriving,
it's young, you know.

124
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:13,131
It's got a lot
of interesting dynamics.

125
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,583
And I remember the first time
I flew back to I.A.

126
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:19,206
the feeling that I got
getting out of the plane

127
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,139
is "Why am I back here?"

128
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,314
Like, it was a weird thing
where it's this...

129
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:27,145
Inescapable feeling
of kind of the land

130
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,457
having some kind of pull

131
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,906
on your blood
or something like that.

132
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:32,150
Genealogy, I don't know
what it is.

133
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,567
Do you think that Armenia
looks to the West for anything?

134
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:36,810
Yes, definitely.

135
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,294
I think, you know, culturally

136
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:39,709
Armenia is very European.

137
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:42,402
- Culturally? But...
- Culturally.

138
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,542
Politically, it's very much
tied into Russia.

139
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:46,475
Not just
as an ex-Soviet republic,

140
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,891
but there's a lot of economic
investment from Russia,

141
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:52,170
and Russia, obviously, based
on the last two world wars

142
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,483
is extremely... what's the word...

143
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:57,451
They're very afraid
of their borders, let's say.

144
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:59,729
Yes, they are
acutely sensitive...

145
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:03,423
- Acutely sensitive.
- To particularly this area.

146
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:12,673
There are three million
Armenians living in Armenia,

147
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,780
another eight million
around the world.

148
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:17,506
Ever since the genocide,

149
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,475
it's been a long, existential
struggle for survival.

150
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,927
Recent history is defined
by three major events...

151
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:26,998
A massive earthquake in 1988,

152
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:31,140
followed by the collapse
of the USSR in 1991,

153
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:35,455
and then a full-scale war
with Azerbaijan in 1992.

154
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,319
Not to mention limited
employment opportunities

155
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:40,494
and most significantly
its borders,

156
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:43,221
of which approximately
80% have been closed

157
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,361
due to relationships
with its Turkish

158
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:47,501
and Azeri neighbors.

159
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:50,780
Things have not been easy
for Armenians.

160

♪

161

Most estimates historically

169

put it around 1.5 million.

170
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,437
That's a lot of people.

171
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:30,268
Especially a lot of people
when we look at the per capita,

172
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,442
when we look at the impact
this had.

173
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:36,343

what was historically
western Armenia

176
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:43,212
was under the control
of the Ottoman Empire,

177
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:45,041
present day Turkey.

178

00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:50,460
that Christian Armenians
would align themselves

180
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:52,877
with a hostile
and also Christian Russia,

181
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,189
then undergoing
its second revolution

182
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:56,950
and threatening their borders,

183
00:08:56,984 --> 00:09:00,125
the Turks rounded up
Armenian intellectuals

184
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,059
and summarily executed them.

185
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:06,615
Military and police units were
dispatched to the countryside

186
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,687
to drive out Armenians
from their villages.

187
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:12,448
They hanged local leaders
in the town squares,

188
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:15,140
burned churches,
destroyed manuscripts,

189
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:18,592
then marched anyone left
towards the Syrian desert,

190
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:21,664
deliberately starving them
along the way.

191
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:27,912
Those who survived
scattered across the globe.

192
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:30,293
They formed large
and vibrant communities

193
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:32,226
that survive today.

194
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:34,815
They never forgot the past

195
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,990
and who and what had pushed them

196
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:38,750
from their homeland.

197
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,102
Let's start with this:
genocide.

198
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:49,174
Many people seem awfully
and curiously reluctant

199
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:50,590
to use this word.

200
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:54,110
As American national
foreign policy,

201
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:56,009
we use what, "catastrophe"?

202
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:58,528
Yeah, a "regrettable
series of incidents."

203
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:00,358
- Yeah, how insulting.
- Yes.

204
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,601
But, I mean, it seems to me,

205
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,947
just as a casual observer,

206
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:05,846
anytime a state actor
or organization

207
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:08,504
makes a concerted
and organized effort

208
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:12,370
to eradicate any ethnic
or national group

209
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,683
that... that's genocide, right?

210
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:17,375
Yes, what's important
though, however,

211
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,205
is this is our defining issue.

212
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,276
This is the unifying issue,

213
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:23,553
and it's probably in many ways

214
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:26,764
the only defining issue,
both good and bad.

215
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:30,215
For Armenians, both Diaspora
and living here?

216
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,390
Yes, it's the fact that, yes,

217
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,704
my grandfather's a survivor,
every family's touched.

218
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:38,568
But it's not the personal.
It's also the political.

219
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:41,951
If Turkey wasn't so adamant
about denying

220
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:43,712
the historical accuracy,

221
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:46,059
this is what makes it
a living issue,

222
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:47,405
a present issue.

223
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,234
- Going forward...
- Mmm-hmm?

224
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:52,341
Do you think there will be
some kind of reconciliation?

225
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,998
Well, I'm
a little more positive.

226
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:55,724
This is now the turning point,

227
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:59,037
Armenia looking to normalize
relations with Turkey

228
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:02,247
not because of the genocide
but despite the genocide.

229
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:03,593
Do you have any expectation

230
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:05,734
of fruitful negotiations
with Erdogan?

231
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:07,805
It seems to me that
things have...

232
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,530
kind of taken a downward turn.

233
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:12,741
They have, but it was
never supposed to be that easy

234
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:14,743
or that quick.

235
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:17,746
We also need to go beyond
victimization

236
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,371
and to take more pride
in survival.

237
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:24,373
♪

238
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:52,884
♪

239
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:03,619
Lavash, the national bread.

240
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:07,623
An ever-present feature
of the Armenian table

241
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:09,556
and a part of everyday life.

242
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,767
Baked on a tonir,

243
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:15,665
or underground clay oven,

244
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,291
its preparation is passed down
from generation to generation.

245
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:30,611
Markets like Gum
near the city center

246
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:32,130
date back to Soviet days,

247
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:33,822
but they remain a favorite stop

248
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:36,479
for an older generation
of Armenians.

249
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:47,283
October brings an array
of seasonal produce,

250
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:49,458
and Miriam
and her grandmother Leah

251
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:51,805
pick up ingredients
for a fall tradition...

252
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,222
Ghapama, a rice dish
baked in pumpkin.

253
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,196
The top of the pumpkin
is removed,

254
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,957
and the seeds and pulp
are scraped out.

255
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:07,925
Dried fruit, almonds, and honey

256
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,997
are mixed with rice
and baked inside.

257
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:17,866
Incredible.

258
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,386
So, as main course
we prepared Ghapama,

259
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:22,836
which has its own song.

260
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,804
Serj?

261
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:30,464
Usually, when you bring in
the dish, you sing it.

262
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:32,018
We don't cook it very often,

263
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,882
but it's an autumn meal.

264
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,469
We have some pickles there.

265
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,333
We have Armenian cheese there.

266
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,957
And I'm going to serve
Armenian bread.

267
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:42,373
And this looks like...

268
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:43,581
It looks like hummus.

269
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,376
- It is hummus.
- That's hummus.

270
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,826
Hummus and bread.

271
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,861
And it's not Armenian.

272
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:49,725
This is mutabal.

273
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,692
We're not laying any claims
that they're Armenian,

274
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,073
but many western
Armenian families

275
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:55,213
grow up with this
on the table as well.

276
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:57,181
Miriam, her mother,
and grandmother

277
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:59,528
were all born here in Yerevan.

278
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:02,255
Her husband, Nazareth,
and his family

279
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,258
are more typical
of the diaspora Armenians.

280
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:08,778
His mom, Nar, was born
in Beirut.

281
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:11,885
Nazareth, in Toronto.

282
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,508
What language
will your children speak?

283
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,062
Where will they live?

284
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,236
- Here.
- Yeah, here.

285
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:19,444
No hesitation?

286
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:21,791
That's the easy question
to answer.

287
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,517
But I think the two of us

288
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:25,761
would like them to grow up
being equally comfortable

289
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:27,521
with Armenian, Russian,
and English.

290
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:30,214
All three languages
are very, very important

291
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:32,181
for anyone growing up
in Armenia.

292
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:34,459
They are the two largest
Armenian diasporas,

293
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:36,427
Russia and America, so.

294
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:39,568
How many years was it
part of the Soviet Union?

295
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:43,537
Uh, 70 years, since 1921
more or less until 1991.

296
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:45,091
So, 70 years.

297
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,852
But what remains of those times?

298
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:15,293
You sound... wistful
about the old days.

299
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,503
Are things better now or worse?

300
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:30,308
When Armenia was swallowed up
by the Soviet Union in 1922,

301
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:34,002
it became the Armenian
Soviet Socialist Republic.

302
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:36,936
With that came purges
and paranoia

303
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,627
but also a rapid
industrialization,

304
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:40,836
the evidence of which
is still seen today

305
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,597
in the abandoned factories
and worker's blocks

306
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:45,634
of another time.

307
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:49,155
And a Soviet mentality
and sizeable Russian presence

308
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:52,813
still hang over the country
like a dead weight.

309
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:57,370
No matter how you felt
about Soviet rule,

310
00:15:57,404 --> 00:16:00,511
the transition was a rough one.

311
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:03,686
After the collapse
of the USSR in 1991,

312
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:05,723
Armenia suffered
terrible food shortages

313
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,380
and a ruined electrical grid

314
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:10,176
that allowed only a couple
of hours of power a day,

315
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,694
if you were lucky.

316
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:15,491
The worst of those years
would be 1992 to 1994.

317
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:18,356
But then a few years
after '94 as well.

318
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:20,041
There was a lot
of pilferage in the beginning.

319
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,705
There was a lot of...
It was dark, dark days.

320
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,674
And the generation
literally learned alphabet

321
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,331
with the candlelight.

322
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:30,161
Back then, we had only
two hours maybe?

323
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:37,030
It was something to observe

324
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:40,033
because during those two hours

325
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:41,897
someone would go to the balcony

326
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,174
and scream in the yard:

327
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,349
"We have lights,
the electricity is back!"

328
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:47,730
And everybody would go
do their laundry,

329
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,042
ironing, and cooking.

330
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:51,527
Everything would be done
in that one hour.

331
00:16:57,947 --> 00:16:59,259
Oh yeah.

332
00:16:59,294 --> 00:17:01,917
But they raised us with love,

333
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,540
and we would play games.

334
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:07,578
Ma would have her friends
coming over playing guitar.

335
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:11,202
Looking back, I don't remember
the darkness.

336
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:12,445
I remember that it was dark,

337
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:15,448
but emotionally
we didn't feel that.

338
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:18,934
Parents, grandparents
really did their best

339
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:20,763
for kids not to feel
the darkness.

340
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,628
It was heroism on their part.

341
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:24,871
Especially in the winter.

342
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:26,528
Especially the winter.

343
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:29,117
But also I think we're observing

344
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,981
a very interesting period
of our history

345
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:34,605
when change is happening.

346
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,607
Little by little,
and it's us to make.

347
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:38,471
Right, Serj?

348
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,139
♪

349
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:15,680
The Tumo Center

350
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:17,993
is an after-school program
for kids.

351
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:19,857
You get to pick your course
of study,

352
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,585
be it art, technology,
creative writing, whatever.

353
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:25,000
There are no grades,

354
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:27,658
no mandatory
course requirements,

355
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,625
and upwards of 14,000 kids
are enrolled

356
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,007
at four locations
across Armenia.

357
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,768
It's free,
an entirely non-profit,

358
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:36,356
privately funded venture,

359
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:39,911
an investment in the youth
of a young country.

360
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:55,893
The main goal is

361
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:59,966
to complement
their formal education.

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,210
The curriculum is not mandatory.

363
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:04,384
You pick what you want.

364
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:05,834
You can pick music,

365
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:09,217
graphic design, 3D modeling,

366
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:11,046
or programming, games,

367
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,222
whatever, photography, robotics.

368
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:17,017
The managing director,
Maria Lou Papazian,

369
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:19,744
and her husband Pegor
are two former members

370
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:22,230
of the Armenian Diaspora,

371
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:24,404
both extraordinary
but not unusual

372
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,854
in the new Armenia.

373
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:28,097
They're not ex-pats but re-pats,

374
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:29,996
people who though not born here

375
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,102
have chosen to come home
and help build a nation.

376
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:34,828
Well, we grew up
together in Beirut

377
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:36,416
then moved to the States.

378
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:38,073
And the reason we moved

379
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,317
was because of
the Armenian thing.

380
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:41,939
Our kid was growing up,

381
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,770
so we told our friends
we're gonna move,

382
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:47,190
we need him to go
to Armenian school.

383
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,720
So they said,
"You're going to Armenia?"

384
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:51,914
I said,
"No, Glendale, California."

385
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:54,572
But, eventually,
we did move here, 12 years ago.

386
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:56,264
Living in Glendale

387
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:57,955
and keeping always saying

388
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,129
you have to keep your identity

389
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:02,097
was strange.

390
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:05,963
And every time coming up
with stories for the kids,

391
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,965
you have to love your country,

392
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,554
you're Armenian,
you have to speak Armenian.

393
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:12,038
Whereas once you're here,

394
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:13,626
you just forget all about that,

395
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,249
and it's more about being
a good person,

396
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:18,458
having ambitions, all of that.

397
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:20,046
And the Armenian part,

398
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,979
you can let that
happen naturally.

399
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:27,881
Apricot vodka
is a good start to a meal.

400
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,367
Gyan is local favorite,

401
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:33,301
a restaurant operating out of
what was once a private home,

402
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:35,993
something of a throwback
to Soviet days

403
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,651
like the Cuban paladars,
when private enterprise,

404
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:41,309
not to mention the spending
of money on entertainment,

405
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:46,141
could be frowned on,
and privacy was at a premium.

406
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:52,837
Trout wrapped and baked
in lavash.

407
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:55,668
This is not light cooking.

408
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:04,021
There's certain things

409
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,506
about especially maybe
the last 20, 30 years

410
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,301
of the Soviet Union, '60s on,

411
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:11,856
that not the brutal, early
Bolshevik Stalinist times

412
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:14,618
but later on were,
in terms of investment

413
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:15,964
and culture and education...

414
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:17,931
Well, I mean, it's very much

415
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:19,692
a legacy of the Soviet Union.

416
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:22,281
Armenia was kind of
a nerd republic in a way.

417
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,697
They specialized
in different republics,

418
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:27,216
and Armenia was where
they concentrated

419
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:31,359
science, technology,
particle accelerator,

420
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:33,671
radio telescope, all of that.

421
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:35,708
And so we benefitted from that,

422
00:21:35,742 --> 00:21:37,641
and you see a lot of
Armenians attributing that

423
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:39,332
to our "genes" and so on.

424
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:43,060
But, of course, our genes
are the same as anyone else's.

425
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,683
It's the culture that...
Right.

426
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,264
You know, you take
the good with the bad,

427
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:50,723
and the good is we're
a cerebral nation in a way.

428
00:21:50,757 --> 00:21:52,656
That's how we grew up.
We like chess.

429
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,141
We're like we're nerds.

430
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:21,926
Armenia enjoyed
a somewhat celebrated status

431
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:23,480
during Soviet times,

432
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:26,345
and Russian influence
is everywhere still.

433
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,347
Chess is taught
in public schools,

434
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,279
a basic life skill.

435
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:34,249
It's probably the fact that
Armenia was such a powerhouse

436
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:36,596
of smart, highly educated
brainiacs

437
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:39,116
with strong backgrounds
in engineering, math,

438
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,256
rocketry, and technology,

439
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,224
a veritable Silicon Valley
of the Caucuses

440
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:48,436
that largely spared them
the worst of Soviet rule,

441
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,370
and also perhaps the reason
that it continues

442
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,406
to be a leader in IT.

443
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:56,720
I meet a few members
from the tech community

444
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:59,136
at a local brewery in Yerevan...

445
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,035
Arthur, an industry writer,

446
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,969
Harot, a software engineer,

447
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:07,455
and Ruben, a cyber security
consultant.

448
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:09,940
So what are you making?

449
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,459
What is coming of this?

450
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:14,427
IT is a big...

451
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:16,325
- For the country.
- It's a big house.

452
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,051
So, websites,

453
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:19,881
web based stuff and chip design.

454
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:21,779
We're all over the place
actually.

455
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,609
But this comes
from the old times, you know.

456
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:25,438
Like, in Soviet times
what happened is

457
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:27,095
they manufactured chips,

458
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:29,166
lots of electronic stuff for...

459
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,340
I heard for Soviet submarines.

460
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,446
But actually it was

461
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:36,484
a success story
in the Soviet time.

462
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:38,347
You can have a success story

463
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:41,143
if you were
a Communist Party official

464
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:44,008
or if you were doing science.

465
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:45,941
Or perhaps artist,
and that's it.

466
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:50,014
And the science was
the most clean career.

467
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:53,293
I mean, you were not
compromising your own beliefs,

468
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:55,364
and you were
doing something good.

469
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:58,816
If you were to imagine
the perfect business

470
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:01,819
and the most efficient export
for a land-locked nation

471
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:04,028
with most of its borders closed,

472
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:06,686
it would be
information technology, right?

473
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:08,999
Or, to put it simply, brains.

474
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:11,829
They teach chess in school?
Yes.

475
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:15,833
In school?
Starting at what age?

476
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,386
Third grade.
My son hates it, he's...

477
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,112
No, second grade.

478
00:24:19,147 --> 00:24:22,391
- So everybody plays chess?
- Yeah, you kind of...

479
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:24,670
That already is
a very different...

480
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:25,981
I have a ranking actually.

481
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:27,776
Really? I didn't know.
Come on.

482
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:29,502
Small number.

483
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:32,609
But that's a very different
mentality than most places.

484
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:36,026
Actually, my mom
took me to chess class.

485
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,959
It was not because
of the country's

486
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:39,892
like a super nation in chess
or something.

487
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:42,135
Just she wanted to take me
some place

488
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,345
where, like, I can develop
my brains.

489
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,176
But, actually,
there's a quick answer.

490
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,419
When you are being oppressed

491
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:52,076
during your history,

492
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:55,563
knowledge is something
that cannot be taken off you.

493
00:24:55,597 --> 00:24:59,083
Anything can happen.
Soviet Union can collapse.

494
00:24:59,118 --> 00:25:02,017
There can be pogroms.
There can be immigration.

495
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:05,434
They can take your home.
They can take your fortune.

496
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,333
But knowledge and skill
is something

497
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:10,543
that remains with you
for all of the time.

498
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:14,582
And that's why Armenians
are investing in education,

499
00:25:14,616 --> 00:25:16,515
in knowledge, in skill,

500
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,276
to invest in the development
of a child.

501
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:24,833
All of us are children
that were invested in.

502
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:29,113
The knowledge is something
that you always keep with you.

503
00:25:29,148 --> 00:25:33,532
I think this explains a lot.

504
00:25:47,822 --> 00:25:50,203
My trip to the disputed,

505
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:52,758
Armenian-controlled enclave
of Nagorno-Karabakh

506
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:55,381
requires an early morning stop
at a military base

507
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:57,383
on the outskirts of Yerevan.

508
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:01,214
And, apparently,
a flight in this thing,

509
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:04,770
a smoking, flame-belching,
banged-up looking

510
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:07,289
Soviet Mi-8 twin turbine chopper

511
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:09,602
whose appearance
prior to boarding

512
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:12,398
does not fill me
with confidence.

513
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:23,236
But, once up in the air,

514
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:26,446
it takes me over crags
and peaks and steppes

515
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:28,414
across the international
recognized border

516
00:26:28,448 --> 00:26:30,002
with Azerbaijan

517
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:33,074
to what the Armenians
call Arstakh,

518
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:36,905
an isolated pocket
surrounded on all sides

519
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,080
by Azeris.

520
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:42,083
Whose mountains these are

521
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:45,811
is a subject of contention
and conflict to say the least.

522
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:48,607
When the borders of
the South Caucasus were drawn

523
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:52,024
by the Russian conquerors
some 200 years ago,

524
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:53,646
a strong Russian presence
kept ethnic

525
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:55,683
and religious rivalries
in check.

526
00:26:55,717 --> 00:26:58,340
But, whenever disorder
hit Russia,

527
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,997
war has broken out here.

528
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:03,483
Most recently, after the fall
of the USSR.

529
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,488
The brutal conflict
went largely ignored

530
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:10,214
internationally.

531
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:11,664
As with any war,

532
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:13,459
particularly wars with an ethnic

533
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:15,668
or religious component
over territory,

534
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:17,670
it was ugly, murderous,

535
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:21,812
and with atrocities
committed by both sides.

536
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:25,057
1992 was a turning point.

537
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:27,784
The Armenians organized
and created their own army

538
00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:29,786
and, surprising everyone,
pushed through

539
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,064
and took full control
of Karabakh

540
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:34,583
and the surrounding areas.

541
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:37,483
These buffer zones
are ethnically Azeri

542
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:38,898
and bitterly contested

543
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:41,798
and the subject
of continuing dispute.

544
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:44,490
There are still
violent confrontations,

545
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:47,044
the latest being
a four-day battle

546
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,875
in the Spring of 2016.

547
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:52,153
Russia's role in the conflict

548
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,017
is suspiciously cynical.

549
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:58,159
They actively arm, support,
and advise both sides

550
00:27:58,193 --> 00:27:59,988
as it appears in their interest

551
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:04,061
that there be
no lasting resolution.

Travel to this region
continues to be

554
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,345
a particularly sensitive issue,

555
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,589
especially for the Azeris.

556
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:16,695
Simply by coming here,
I've become,

557
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,283
as I read in the papers
a few days later,

558
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:24,012
officially persona non grata
in Azerbaijan.

559
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:28,603
Stepanakert is the capital
of the autonomous republic

560
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:31,744
of Nagorno-Karabakh.

561

Zhingalov Khats is
a specialty of the region.

563
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:52,040
This lavash bread is stuffed
with greens and onions

564
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:55,630
before being toasted
atop a cast-iron sheet.

565

Khorovats... basically,
Armenian barbecue.

566
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,229
Meat on a stick,

567
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:11,611
which is... let's face it...
Always good.

568
00:29:14,442 --> 00:29:17,756
Khorovats.

569
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,311
Armenians try sometimes
to cook it.

570
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:25,004
Not the same thing.

571
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,661
Armenia and Karabakh,

572
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:29,146
two different things
or the same?

573
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:32,011
Not really. Karabakh is...

574
00:29:32,046 --> 00:29:34,255
definitely part of
the Armenian civilization,

575
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:36,084
the Armenian culture.

576
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,776
I wouldn't separate them.

577
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,468
I think Karabakh is
part of Armenia

578
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:42,642
but not part of
the Republic of Armenia.

579
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:44,921
It's like a continuation
of Armenia.

580
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:46,094
We are the same.

581
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:47,924

He now runs a guest house
here in Shushi.

588
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:05,734
To what extent is this
just a religious conflict?

589
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:07,074
- No, it's not really.
- Not at all?

590
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:10,360
- No, no, no, no. Nothing...
- No, no.

591
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,155
This is a Christian island.

592
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:14,640
Well, this is
Christian island, it's true.

593
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:15,848
This is Christian island.

594
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:18,402
But the conflict
of Nagorno-Karabakh

595
00:30:18,437 --> 00:30:19,887
is not religious.

596
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:22,303
There are people here,
hardliners here,

597
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:24,823
who refer to Azeris as Turks.

598
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,894
- But they are Turks.
- They are Turks.

599
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:30,138
- They are Turks, yes.
- Please explain.

600
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:33,901
I think probably they are
not ident...

601
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:36,558
They do not bear
historical responsibility

602
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:39,044
for the actions committed
by the Ottomans.

603
00:30:39,078 --> 00:30:42,254
But the struggle of
the people Nagorno-Karabakh

604
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:46,051
for their existence is
continuation of the struggle

605
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:49,261
of Armenian people
to live peacefully on...

606
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:51,228
In their historical homeland.

607
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:54,335
I'm not saying that
Azeris and Turks

608
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:55,784
are the same nations.

609
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:56,882
But they are Turk nations...

610
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,891
They're working in unison.

611
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:02,239
Yeah, they're working
in unity today

612
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:04,000
to isolate Armenia.

613
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:05,760
Do you think there's a sense

614
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:07,935
that when people
look at this conflict

615
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:10,213
they think they look back
and they say

616
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:11,870
this is what could happen
in the future?

617
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,112
Yeah, absolutely.

618
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:15,735
It is absolutely
an existential conflict.

619
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:18,704
If we lose, we know
that we will be destroyed.

620
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:22,294
Who will help?
Who cares?

621
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:23,364
Support?

622
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:24,434
Who will support you

623
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,539
if things once again get ugly?

624
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:27,740
What do you think the future...

625
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:29,646
- No one, no one. We.
- No one?

626
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,131
I think there is
a clear understanding

627
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,270
in Armenian society

628
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:36,032
that we can only rely
on ourselves.

629
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,724
But another reality
is we are paying

630
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:40,036
very, very high price.

631
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:44,385
Since 1994, Armenian
and Karabakh sides

632
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:48,078
lost about 3,000 soldiers.

633
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:54,429
We are losing our 18,
20 year old sons, you know.

634
00:31:54,464 --> 00:31:56,259
This is sad reality.

635
00:31:56,293 --> 00:32:00,815
And I don't know how
will this situation continue.

636
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:02,334
I don't know.

637
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:06,234
I think it's the right time
to drink for peace.

638
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:08,409
For peace, yeah.

639
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:09,479
You read my mind now.

- Good.
- Yeah.

it's a sheep's head but...

697

- Yes.
- This is called "kalleh."

698

- "Kalleh." Kalleh.
- In the local language.

699

When I was kid,
I remember my father

700

not only went
to restaurant with kalleh,

701
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,863
but he brought it home for us.

702
00:35:41,898 --> 00:35:43,348
- Oh yeah?
- And I was afraid.

Yeah.

that we can count on.

712
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:15,656
But what I see 10 years ago
and 10 years now

713
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,830
Gyumri is developing quite fast.

714
00:36:17,865 --> 00:36:20,212
It's really good.
I see really good developments.

715
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:24,527
And I can say that's mostly due
to the younger generation.

716
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:26,114
I would definitely say that.

717
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:29,428
It's self-employment
and entrepreneurship

718
00:36:29,463 --> 00:36:31,775
that is developing
among the youth

719
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,607
very, very in a very kind of
fast way these days.

720
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:38,782
Because people understand
that if you stay in Gyumri

721
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:41,199
you need to create
your own stuff.

722
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,408
We never should stop.

723
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:44,754
We never should wait for others

724
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:47,274
to help our city and ourselves.

725
00:36:47,308 --> 00:36:49,241
We should think,
we should create,

726
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:51,519
we should use our strong sides

727
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:53,728
to move forward.

I don't want to wonder.

Dilijan is the Switzerland

It's one of
my favorite spots actually.

744
00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:00,933
What am I eating today?

745
00:38:00,968 --> 00:38:03,177
I think you're eating
khash today.

746
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:04,972
Said to be a hangover cure.

747
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:06,491
That's it, yeah.

748
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:09,010
It's made out of
legs of cows, I think.

749
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:11,358
Cool, I like legs of cows.

750
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:12,359
I like their eyes.

751
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:14,015
Not to eat but just to look at.

752
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,810
Me too, they're so dreamy.

753
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:17,191
They are.

Joining Serj and I at the table

765
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:54,470

Khash is what hipster goofs
these days

00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:08,691
would call bone broth,

771
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:14,317
basically a stock flavored
by roasted beef bones.

772
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:18,045
In Armenian,
we say "khash."

773
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,012
It means just boiled.
Right.

774
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:22,394
So there is big debate whether
it's Georgian or Armenian.

775
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:24,914
Of course, every Armenian
is sure it's Armenian.

776

What are you talking about?

We're gonna do the...

779
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:36,443
Garlic, garlic.
First comes garlic.

780
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:38,099
I see.

781
00:39:38,134 --> 00:39:39,584
But pay attention to the salt.

782
00:39:39,618 --> 00:39:42,966
If you are not leveling it
with the right level...

783
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:45,279
Garlic level for you, it's okay?

784
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:47,108
Yeah, so garlic.
So far so good.

785
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:49,110
Then, okay, you have
one more plate.

786
00:39:49,145 --> 00:39:50,767
You remove the meat.

787
00:39:50,802 --> 00:39:54,288
Wow, this is...
You take this very seriously.

788
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:56,739
- Yeah, yeah.
- This is a ritual.

789
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:57,947
It's a ritual.

790
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,535
Does everybody have
their own style?

791
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:02,123
Or is this the absolute...
This is the way?

792
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:03,470
Yeah, but the classics say

793
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:05,299
you have to eat with your hands.

794
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:08,302
This is... this is the classics.
You eat with your hands.

795
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:09,721
Whoever is not eating
with his hands,

796
00:40:09,752 --> 00:40:11,236
they are teasing him.

797
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,996
"Hey, you're a loser"
or something like that.

798
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:14,619
- Really?
- Yeah.

799
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:16,483
And you're literally
judged by a person

800
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:18,726
if he's eating good khash or...

801
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:20,452
- Yeah, yeah.
- Like, "See the guy?"

802
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:22,143
He's the first, see the guy.

803
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:24,456
- Harsh. That's...
- See the guy.

- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

808

810
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:43,095
to a place that hosts us.

811
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,789
We say...
[speaks Armenian]

812
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:48,653
Which literally means:

813
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:51,656
"Let my feet bring
luck to this home."

814
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:58,525
So, let your feet
bring luck to our country,

815
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,598
to Dilijan, and to this home.

816
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:07,465
I think guys with khash
we do like lots of toasts,

817
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,501
but it has to be short.

818
00:41:09,536 --> 00:41:11,676
You can go like Armenian toasts
are very long.

819
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,472
Because people have
to be concentrated on khash.

820
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:17,371
No, no, no, because it
will get cold.

821

Yeah, yeah, we were
always between Iran and Rome.

"what do they feel?"
