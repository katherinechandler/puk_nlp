00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:53,196
Uh, education free.
Also a very big medium class.

128
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:54,888
That is very important
for Uruguay.

129
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:56,372
- Right.
- That began to change

130
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:58,339
after the '60s and '70s.

131
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:00,549

132
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,516
socialist, or God forbid,
communist movements

133
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:04,484
in Latin America in the '60s

134
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,383
was an area
of great concern for the U.S.

135
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,143

authoritarian-leaning

National Liberation Movement,

cause for alarm at the CIA.

A lot of students, young people,

142
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,817
were very active in politics.

143
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:30,199
There weren't the low classes,
as you could say.

144
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:32,056
They weren't the poor people
who were doing this.

145
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:34,058
These are middle-class kids

146
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:35,445
Yeah.
At the beginning, I think,

147
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,414
they really thought
they could change the system.

148
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:41,417
With covert and overt
support by our country,

149
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,557
a state of emergency
was declared,

150
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:45,041
and a right-wing dictatorship

151
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:47,250
grabbed hold of
the instruments of power

152
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,563
launching a period of
repression that

153
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:53,256
lasted from 1973 until 1985.

What kind of people were
finding themselves swept up?

161

- Especially teachers.
- Teachers?

162
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:16,797
- Professors from university.
- Troublesome intellectuals.

163
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,592
Sometimes lawyers or...

164
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:22,078
Something like 3% to 5%
of the entire population,

165
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:25,254
uh, had gone through
the prison system.

166
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:27,290
I mean, we're not talking
about incarceration.

167
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:28,630
We're talking about...
No, no, no, no.

168
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:29,983
They were tortured and then

169
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,709
kept inside a prison system

170
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:35,816

to pretty much destroy them.

Massive demonstrations

173
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:45,136
forced the government
to hold elections,

174
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,276
and the military
was swept from power.

175

- I think it's going well.

177
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,009
We have troubles.
We are in Latin America.

178
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:58,943
We'd like to believe that
we are a European country.

179

We are not.

180
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,774
- But are you optimistic?
- I am.

181
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,189
I am.

182
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:08,469
I don't see, like,
a huge crisis coming.

183
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:13,095

186
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,528
When people think of this

187
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:34,392
often overlooked little country,

188
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,153
if they think of it at all,
they tend to think of it

189
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:40,329
patronizingly as
Argentina's little brother.

190
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:41,641
Not so.

191
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,470
And that attitude
pushes people here

192
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:45,334
to think of themselves
in many ways

193
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:47,785
as existentially in opposition

194
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:50,063

Here, if you're
a little bit courageous,

It's a scene here.

201
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:04,215
Like, to be flashy,
it... it's a scene.

202
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:07,321
To be successful, it's not
something that is one scene.

203
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:09,013
You got to do it quietly.

204
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:11,153
There's a saying,
"[speaking Spanish]."

205
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,258
It means "Stay in
the small thing," you know?

206
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,157
Right..

207
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,710
It's something that defines...
Right.

208
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:19,437

00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:30,620
What was it like for a woman

213
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:35,556
working in the restaurant
industry in the early 2000s?

214
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:39,043
I was very lucky
because Francis, he had, like,

215
00:11:39,077 --> 00:11:42,115
this army of women... no?
Around him.

216
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,393
You were surrounded by women
from the beginning?

217
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:45,774
Yes. Yes.

218
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:48,362
Is that an unusual situation
in Uruguay do you think?

219
00:11:48,397 --> 00:11:50,882
- I mean...
- I'm not asking you, man.

220
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,290
You're... you're a man.
I'm asking...

221
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:55,749
Oh, I sound like a woman.

222
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:59,373
The food here takes its cues
from Spain and Italy.

223
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:02,445
Homemade gnocchi

So when you were first
planning the menu for this place

227
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:14,941
and thinking about the
concept...

228
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,666
- Yeah.
- What inspired you?

229
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,876

a small restaurant,

You want fish?

232
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,470
Very nice and a little
vegetables, you know?

233
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:29,334
Right.
This is the most vegetables

234
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:31,889

239

Just the one? Two?
Three.

- Three.
- Three.

- Nice number, man.
- You're not lazy.

242
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:42,858
- No.
- It's just a little dump.

Happiness is a thing that...
No, no.

251
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:04,818
Happiness all the time
is fascism.

252

- No. It doesn't exist, man.
- It's oppressive.

You're not doing anything.

You're not allowed
to build here anymore, so
