There are parts of America
that are special,

00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,590
unique, unlike anywhere else,

24
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:48,901
cultures all their own...

25
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:53,458
Kept close, much loved,
but largely misunderstood.

26
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,947
The vast patchwork
of saltwater marshes,

27
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:02,950
bayous, and prairie land
that make up Cajun Country

28
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:05,815
is one of those places.

29
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:06,988
While the rest of the USA

30
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:09,267
got stitched together
by superhighways,

31
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,510
southwestern Louisiana remained

32
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,341
relatively isolated.

33
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,309
I-10 wasn't completed
until the 1970s,

34
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:19,173
finally connecting
this part of the state

35
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,349
to New Orleans, Houston,
and the rest of the nation.

36
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:24,178
With that came
chain restaurants,

37
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:27,871
drive-throughs,
and strip malls, but fear not.

38
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:30,495
It's still magnificently weird.

39
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:42,472
Take, for example,
Cajun Mardi Gras.

40
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:45,199
Ordinarily, I loathe
the idea of Mardi Gras.

41
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:46,994
Any kind of group celebration,

42
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:48,996
anything festive
involving dancing

43
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,999
fills me with
self-conscious dread.

44
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,725
Thousands of happy drunks

45
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,244
crowded into the French Quarter,

46
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,660
for instance... not for me.

47
00:02:57,694 --> 00:03:01,388
But Cajun Mardi Gras
is another thing entirely...

48
00:03:01,422 --> 00:03:03,666
Closer to the ancient
French tradition,

49
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,909
vaguely more dangerous.

50
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:09,258
Downright medieval.

51
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:11,536
Cajuns do things their way...

52
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,021
Always have, always will.

53
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:15,885
Whether it's hanging on
to the French language

54
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,921
of their ancestors, their music,

55
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:20,303
traditions, or food,

56
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:24,928
Cajuns fiercely
keep it all vibrantly alive.

57
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:30,382
Boudin is a ubiquitous
sausage of Cajun Country,

58
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,867
and judging by the line
up at the drive through,

59
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:35,974
Billy's Boudin is
pretty damn popular.

60
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:40,944
So this is a boudin ball

61
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,601
stuffed with pepper jack cheese,

62
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:46,985
which I believe Billy's is
responsible for its invention.

63
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,401
What's not to like?
Ground-up sausage

64
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:52,956
and molted cheese,
battered and fried?

65
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:55,752
Who's gonna hate that?
No one.

66
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:56,960
In addition to boudin,

67
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:59,273
breakfast around here
wouldn't be complete

68
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:03,967
without some cracklins,
and of course, a cold beer.

69
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:06,004
My father's
first language is French.

70
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,317
I mean, as a kid, for him,

71
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:11,665
he was whipped at school
for speaking French.

72
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,461
Yeah, I mean, look,
is it fair to say that

73
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:16,428
at most points in its history,

74
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:20,294
the Cajuns have been,
if not, a despised minority...

75
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,987
An aggressively
marginalized minority.

76
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:27,819
Our depiction stops at
swamp scenes and alligators,

77
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:29,579
and it's so much more
than that...

78
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,781
Not just because of the food,
not just because of the music,

79
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,411
because of the way of life,
you know?

80
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:37,104
Especially Acadiana...
This is the most European

81
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:41,004
part of America, in my opinion.

82
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,627
So we're gonna
eat well this week?

83
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:46,493
Yeah, a lot of good food,
a lot of house parties.

84
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:49,496
- Excited about Mardi Gras?
- Mm.

85
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,360
My first.
Never been to one.

86
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:52,982
Here, it's a
whole different thing.

87
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:55,364
I mean,
the major difference is that,

88
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:58,332
here, you're the event.

89
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,817
If you're attending Mardi Gras,
if you're running Mardi Gras,

90
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:02,336
you are part of it.

91
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:03,682
Right.

92
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,513
Like,
it's bigger than Christmas.

93
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:10,379
Toby Rodriguez is about
as Cajun as you get.

94
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:12,001
I met him nearly a decade ago

95
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:15,384
when I came here
for a boucherie.

96
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:18,490
Back then,
Toby and everybody else said,

97
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:20,354
"You got to come back
for our Mardi Gras."

98
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:21,907
- Wanna give me a hand?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:24,531
"We do Mardi Gras right."

100
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:26,395
And so, here I am.

101
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:27,844
It's the week before,

102
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,537
and there's
anticipation in the air.

103
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:33,540
All over Acadiana,
scenes like this unfold.

104
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:36,370
Out in the yard
with friends and family,

105
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:39,408
kids playing, music, dancing,

106
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:42,445
beer, good Catholic whiskey,

107
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,758
gumbo cooking in a big pot.

108
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:48,295
♪

109
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,541
Mardi Gras!

110
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,580
Welcome back.
How you doing?

111
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:15,720
Really good.
Good to see you both again.

112
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:17,515
- Good to see you too.
- Thanks.

113
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:21,104
You might call the
Savoy family Cajun royalty.

114
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,589
I know them from my last visit,

115
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:24,522
and it's good to see them again.

116
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:26,627
Marc Savoy was
born and raised here

117
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:29,492
in the small prairie town
of Eunice.

118
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:32,599
Together with his wife Ann
and sons Joel and Wilson,

119
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,464
they make up the
Savoy family band.

120
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,614
They've all been playing music
since they were children,

121
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:40,434
and share a devotion...
Dedication...

122
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,056
To Cajun culture.

123
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:44,783
So how far does
the family go back here?

124
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:46,129
Marc, here's the question.

125
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:47,588
How far does your family
go back here?

126
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:50,064
Well, I think back
to the American Revolution

127
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:51,652
because the land that we live on

128
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:54,448
was ceded to
one of our ancestors,

129
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:58,176
and part of that land
is still in our family today.

130
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,730
How the French-Acadian
pioneers got here

131
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:05,183
and ended up becoming Cajun
is a long story.

132
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,634
Forcibly deported
by the Protestant British

133
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:09,463
from their homeland
in Nova Scotia,

134
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:11,741
the Acadians became refugees,

135
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:14,468
eventually settling deep
in the mosquito-infested

136
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:17,160
swamps and flatlands
of Louisiana...

137
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:20,474
A place nobody else
wanted at the time.

138
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,959
Over the years,
the settlers absorbed,

139
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:25,168
to varying degrees,
other cultures...

140
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:28,171
Irish, Spanish, German,
Native American,

141
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:29,966
and West African, among others,

142
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:34,488
mutating into a distinctive
culture unlike any other.

143
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:36,973
So how long has the
family been playing music?

144
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:38,527
Well,
my grandfather was a fiddler,

145
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,495
but I don't know...
I don't know more than that.

146
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,670
- I have that fiddle.
- Yeah.

147
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:45,844
Your grandfather's fiddle,
and your uncle's fiddle.

148
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,225
Yeah,
which was your great uncle.

149
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,021
Living in the same case
here in the house.

150
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:52,541
So what are you guys
doing for Mardi Gras?

151
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,990
- Running.
- Running.

152
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,234
- You ready?
- Uh, I believe I am.

153
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,202
- What are you doing?
- He's accounting.

154
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:01,204
- What are you doing?
- I'm running Mardi Gras.

155
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,552
- What are you doing?
- I'm running Mardi Gras,

156
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:04,691
right here.

157
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:06,037
But, you know, in the old days,

158
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:07,659
it was just people walking.

159
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:09,592
It wasn't... it's become insane.

160
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:11,214
It's become insane,
more and more insane.

161
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:12,761
And every year,
somebody dies in Eunice.

162
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:15,149
Every single year, there's
one death at the Mardi Gras.

163
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:16,530
Every year.
But, you know,

164
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:18,532
you gotta stay away
from the horse's feet.

165
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,569
You know,
like a lot of horse injuries.

166
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:22,191
Like, their horses...
Right.

167
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:23,910
Some horses will kick you
in the head or something.

168
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,574
Oh, okay.

169
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:26,913
I mean, there's a lot
of really good reasons

170
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,577
that you're doing
all these things.

171
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:30,855
I mean, it's the end of winter,

172
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,719
people are out of food...

173
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:35,756
- And it's right before Lent.
- It's the last year.

174
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,724
Yeah, this is the last...

175
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:39,933
You gotta stop everything
for a good while.

176
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,831
Let's just misbehave
before Lent.

177
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:43,592
And then the next day,

Crawfish.

But that's the exception,
not the rule.

301
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:20,963
- It is the exception... huge.
- Yeah.

302
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:22,095
We had a female

303
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,063

And I'm like, "No, you're not.

304
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,899
Don't do it.
They don't accept it."

305
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:28,902

00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:30,179
You get chased off.

307
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:32,112

- Yeah.

308

meaning, as I had said.

377

hundreds of definitions.

378
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,394

it's descendants of slaves

379

and free people of color,

380

the music.

516

One day a year that
you could get it,

524
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:41,323
it was kinda license
to mock the people you were...

525
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:42,386
Who were leaving you
out of the party.

526
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,844
That's where the tall,
conical hats come from...

527
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:46,708
In mockery of the Queen.

528
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:47,944
They were proud people and
they wanted to be recognized.

529
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:49,849
That's why they
disguised their face,

530
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:53,370
and not to feel like
they were taking charity.

531
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,337
- Mm-hmm.
- So they put on a performance.

532
00:26:55,372 --> 00:26:56,856
- You got a little...
- Here you go.

533
00:26:56,891 --> 00:26:59,376
So at each home that we stop at,

534
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,853
there's, like,
a little party that goes on.

535
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,759
Right,
so they knew you were coming,

536
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:04,754
and you knew you were expected.
It's already prearranged.

537
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:06,307
Like, they know we're coming,
they have a chicken,

538
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:08,143
and they cook something and...

539
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:10,042
So if I knew you were coming,

540
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:13,148
what would the
appropriate preparations be?

541
00:27:13,183 --> 00:27:14,667
I should have some food on hand?

542
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:16,289
You could throw money,

543
00:27:16,324 --> 00:27:17,808
you could donate
a couple chickens

544
00:27:17,843 --> 00:27:19,154
that they could chase and grab.

545
00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:20,673
Right.

546
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,047
Basically just
board up the windows,

547
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:25,160
and make like there's
a hurricane coming.

548
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:26,886
Open up the barn,

549
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:28,819
put everything in the barn,
lock the barn.

550
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:29,717
Mm-hmm.

551
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:32,685
I'm talking about
down to a shovel.

552
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,204
If a Mardi Gras finds a shovel

553
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:36,309
just leaning up against
the back of the house,

554
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:37,828
they're gonna grab it,
dig a hole,

555
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:39,416
and bury another Mardi Gras.

556
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,866
- Or me.
- I know.

557
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,041
I will be taking part in
the Mardi Gras run this year,

558
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:46,699
and one does not interject
one's self among hundreds

559
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:50,323
of drunk Cajuns
without proper attire.

560
00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:53,879
Fortunately, Grandma Jackie is
one of the premier couturiers

561
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:56,260
of such specialty garb
in these parts.

562
00:27:56,295 --> 00:27:59,885
How many masks and outfits
do you do a year?

563
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,232
Masks...
I guess I made about 50.

564
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:04,061
I usually have 50 or 60 a year.

565
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:05,753
So you're working on those
all year long?

566
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:07,893
Um, well, yes.

567
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,760
Jackie has created
a signature nose

568
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:14,306
that's unique to her...
Basically, yeah.

569
00:28:14,313 --> 00:28:16,004
- That she's known for.
- Ah.

570
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:23,046
A lot of people just say,
"I want a suit."

571
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,765
Or if I have one, they say,
"Ooh, I like this.

572
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:26,187
I like this one."
Right.

573
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:27,844
Now, if they
come to me and they say,

574
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:29,915
"I want the Saints," or, "LSU,"

575
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:32,538

looks like Santa Claus

00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:41,305
or anything like him.

579
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,792
They have to be traditional,
or I don't make them.
