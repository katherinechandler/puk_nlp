- But, I mean, you know,

95
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,811
they said that in Europe
in the '30s.

96
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:22,248
Right, right, no, I think from
just a military,

97
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,650
logistical point of view,

98

mostly from the fields moving
a million people out, right?

102
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,226
- And they did.
- Yes.

103
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,563
- And what happened?
- Well, first of all,

104
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:39,632
a huge amount of U.S. citizens
were picked up one day

105
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,469

and families were torn apart,

106

ironic thing about it

107
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,305
and the most tragic thing

108
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,907

of years they said,

109

to open the borders again

111
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,179

- The problem was we never

112

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,843
and we celebrate it our style.

180
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,946
We live in unbelievable
times right now.

181
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,214
People are talking about,
you know,

182
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,117
mass deportations of Mexicans.

183
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,451
What's the problem here?

184
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,721
Where does this fear
and loathing come from?

185
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,522
It's just racism is still alive

186
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:26,025
and kicking in America,
you know?

187
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,327
We really don't hear it
from people we're around.

188
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,397
We're around artistic,
laid-back people, you know?

189
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,899
- Right.
- Some idiot said, you know,

190
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,301
he said, "We got to do
something about this situation."

191
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,869
"When all these Mexicans come
over,

192
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,470
we're gonna have a taco truck
on every corner."

193
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,972
And I'm thinking,
"Is this a bad thing?"

194
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,407
Where would all these
food trucks be, you know?

195
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,976
There was only taco trucks
ten years ago.

196
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,978
- It's a prototype for, yeah.
- There wasn't

197
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,848
an Asian fusion truck here,
this kind of truck,

198
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,317
an Indian food truck or this
truck, you know,

199
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,987
Taco truck, I mean,
you opened the door.

200
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,057
We kicked the door down, yeah,

201
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:02,494
White America loves
Mexican food, I mean,

202
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,064
probably more than
any other food at this point.

203
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,332
- Yeah.
- You know...

204
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,934
they sure like
cheap Mexican labor

205
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,668
because they can't
live without it.

206
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,038
- Right.
- Why... why are they

207
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,506
so freaked out about Mexicans?

208
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,575
You know, nobody's talking
about building a wall,

209
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,078
you know,
across the Canadian border.

210
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,913
Who's gonna help them
build the wall?

211
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,883
You got to have
some Mexican power to do that.

212
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,753
That's exactly what I thought.

213
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:38,397
I was at a taco truck
in Eagle Rock,

214
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,766
it's one I go to,

215
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,034
and I just overheard
the guy's conversation.

216
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,470
He was finishing up his order
and the guy goes,

217
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:45,938
"Oh, bro, my mom told me

218
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,974
"not to eat the cilantro
if it's from Mexico

219
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:53,213
because they're shitting in it
to get back at Trump."

220
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,415
And I said,
"Well, don't get me wrong.

221
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,950
"I'm all for a good Trump
takedown,

222
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,619

if they've got that level

everyone gather round.

Yes, Crazy Eddie."

228
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,740

00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:36,322
All right, thank you
very much, everybody.

How Mexican is Mexican?

Not so good.
Spanish is horrible.

Spanish better.

Well, that's what I learned.
This has been an age-old thing

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,953
where everyone's trying
to out Chicano each other,

271
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,521
and I shouldn't feel
that bad about it.

272
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,257
Right, what's the expression
for a bad Chicano?

273

- Pocho.
- Pocho.

274
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,427
Is there a literal
translation there?

275
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,962
Rotting.
So if you say "pocho,"

276
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,796
you're basically saying,
"You're a rotting Mexican.

277
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,566
"You're completely fake,
you've lost all your culture,

278
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,101
therefore you should be hated."

281
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,406
about rounding up
Mexicans left and right,

282
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,774
sending them all... all off to
camps,

283

across the border,

00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,247
I actually think it's good.

286
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:45,484
I think Latinos need this
to rally together to excite.

The world needs aliens to land

00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,088
till it'll actually
come together.

289
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,292
Is there anybody who could
rally all Mexicans, you know?

290
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,595
- Like a spokesperson, yeah.
- No, like a Mexican Reagan.

The last big leader
was Cesar Chavez,

25 years ago at this point.

293
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,470
I mean, you have to have
almost a messianic figure.

350
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,618
On the menu tonight,
jidori chicken

351
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,453
with chipotle cream sauce,

352
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,822
some charred branzino
with summer squash

353
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,057
and sautéed poblano peppers,

354
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,627
and crispy pork tacos
with black garlic mole

355
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,062
and some fat sacks of uni,

356
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,466
and lots of healthy greens.

357
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,800
Why healthy? I mean...

358
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,936
Because we have
such an obese problem

359
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,405
in the United States,
especially Latinos,

360
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,943
so we had to find a way
to make it tasty but healthy.

361
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,747
Healthy food can taste good.

362
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,082
Green, healthier, lighter,

363
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,485
locally sourced versions
of Mexican street classics

364
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,987
are not exactly
what I'd expected,

365
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,657
and I sure as shit
ain't making no rude cracks

366
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,259
about vegan tacos.

367
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,261
Not to this man.
Though to be fair,

368
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,798
Danny Trejo is, like,
the nicest guy in the world.

369
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,370
Here's something I discovered
that completely shocked

370
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:27,005
and surprised me,
so I have to ask you.

371
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,341
Are you a Morrissey fan
by any chance?

372
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,510
- Morrissey?
- Like, from this band,

373
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,111
The Smiths.

374
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,846
Apparently, it's like
a British rock band

375
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,482
of the late '80s that is

376
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:39,451
apparently hugely popular
in the Chicano community.

377
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,688
So you have not been
touched by this, this...

378
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,624
I'm gonna tell you something
right now between me and you.

379
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,528
I listen to no music that came

380
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,400
after the 1968.

381
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,203
I'm, like, the oldies guy.
You know what I mean?

382
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:00,672
So I know your parents
were born in Texas.

383
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,241
Yeah.

384
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:05,211
But can you trace your people
back to one area in Mexico?

385
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:06,645
Monterrey.

386
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,880
My grandmother and grandfather
were born in Monterrey.

387
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,216
Did you speak Spanish
at home, or...

388
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,050
Yeah, yeah, we spoke, we spoke,

389
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:16,188
I spoke Spanish until I was
about nine, ten, and then,

390
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,724
usually you stop
speaking Spanish

391
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,392
when you go to grammar school,

392
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,761
especially in the '50s
because they wouldn't let you.

393
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,596
"No, no, you don't
speak Spanish," you know?

394
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:25,997
So you kind of forget.
Right.

395
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,033
So then... but then when you
start going

396
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,237
to juvenile hall and jail,

397
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,671
you pick it up again
so the guards

398
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,406
won't know
what you're talking about.

399
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,208
Did you get in a 12-step

400
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,543
while you were still
in prison or after?

401
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,711
When I was in prison.
That was 1968.

402
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,913
Cinco de Mayo in 1968.

403
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,950
That was where I just kind of
like made a vow.

404
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,285
I'm... you know, I'm done, you
know?

405
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:49,255
When you get out,
you became a drug counselor.

406
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,923
I dedicated my life
to helping other people.

407
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,792
Everything good that
has happened

408
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,894
to me has happened
as a direct result

409
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,396
of helping someone else,
everything.

410
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:01,967
Well, for example,
you were called to a film set

411
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,971
to counsel somebody,
and you bump into,

412
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,539
of all the people in the world,
Edward Bunker.

413
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,609
- Eddie Bunker.
- The sort legendary ex-con

414
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,744
turned writer and,

415
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,780
I guess, screenwriter as well.

416
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:18,450
I... I knew Eddie in prison,
you see.

417
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,151
And so when he saw me,
"What are you doing here?"

418
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,620
I said, "I'm working
with this kid."

419
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,889
And then he asked me,
"Are you still boxing?"

420
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,291
because I held the lightweight

421
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,725
and welterweight champion
of every joint I was in.

422
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,827
I said, "I'm training.
I still train",

423
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,629
but I don't want to get hit
in the face anymore."

424
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,331
And he said,

425
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:35,302
"We need somebody to train
one of the actors how to box."

426
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,272
The movie was
the awesome "Runaway Train."

427
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,441
Trejo trained and fought
against the actor,

428
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,743
Eric Roberts,
who, along with Jon Voight,

429
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,346
earned Academy Award
nominations for the film.

430
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:50,949
For Danny, it was the start
of a long and glorious career.

431
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,651
He never looked back.

432
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,420
I'll never forget,
Andrei Konchalovsky,

433
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,188
the director, a Russian
aristocrat, right, he says,

434
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,759
"You fight Eric in movie.

435
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,160
You be my friend."

436
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:05,697
Now, if you come out
of the penitentiary

437
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,165
and somebody says,

438
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,168
"You be my friend,"
it's kind of a red flag.

439
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,438
Right.

440
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,205
And then how many films
since then, man?

441
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,541
A whole hell of a lot.
Oh, yeah, they've got to be

442
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,043
at about 320
or something, you know?

443
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,512
You moved from there
to serious bad guys...

444
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:24,450
- Yeah.
- To now action hero franchise.

445
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,518
How do you stay nice
in a business basically

446
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,320
full of [...]holes?

447
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,556
Eddie Bunker, the first time
when I started getting,

448
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,792
like, a little recognition,
he told me something.

449
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,528
He said, "Try to remember"

450
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:40,031
"that the whole world
can think you're a movie star,

451
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,667
but you can't."

452
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,835
And I've watched
movie stars, right?

453
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,036
I hate them.

454
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,638
You know, nobody likes them.

455
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,375
And if you, like, if you're,
like, on a movie set

456
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:50,842
and the movie star comes in,

457
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,044
then after he leaves,
this is how everybody talks,

458
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,713
"That guy's an ass.
I hate that guy.

459
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:58,149
Man, he's rude."
So I don't want to be that guy.

460
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,718
- Right.
- You know what I mean?

461
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,052
One if the things
I've learned, actually,

462
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,388
making television
really early on,

463
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,222
if, like, you show up to, like,

464
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,891
shoot and the people, like,

465
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:07,659
with the cameras
and the crew say,

466
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,227
"Oh, the talent is on set,"

467
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,863
what they really mean
is the [...]hole is on set.

468
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,599
You know, when somebody
calls me the talent or refers

469
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,501
to me as the talent,
it's, like, time to go back

470
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,438
and take a long look
in the mirror, right?

471
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,051
♪

472
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:53,906
♪

473
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,745
They ain't from LA,
but from time to time,

474
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:01,246
you'll find them here,

475
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,715
and when you do,
you best play nice.

476
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,284
Gilbert Melendez,

477
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:10,456
Nick Diaz, and Nate Diaz,

478
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:13,792
three of the greatest
mixed martial artists

479
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:17,095
to ever fight in an octagon.

480
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,497
Gilbert holds the distinction

481
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,298
of being one
of the few MMA fighters

482
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,634
to be ranked number
one in the world

483
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,302
in two weight classes.

484
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,737
Nate and his older brother Nick

485
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:29,441
are both vicious strikers
and grapplers,

486
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:33,144
and about as tough as it gets
in a professional setting

487
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,814
or on the street.

488
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,349
Neither particularly likes
to fight they say,

489
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,619
but should the situation
call for it,

490
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,024
well, let's put it this way,
they will.

491
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,329
Nick and Nate
grew up in Stockton

492
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,832
and still live there
and train there.

493
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,501
Conor McGregor mocked Nate

494
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:58,537
for teaching kids
jujitsu in his hometown.

495
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:01,306
That was before Nate
chased him around the octagon

496
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:06,011
like a little deer
in his last close decision.

497
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:09,014
In one of the greatest fights
in UFC history,

498
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,149
Nate Diaz shocked the world

499
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,551
when, on very short notice,

500
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,787
he stepped in
and submitted McGregor

501
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:16,722
in two rounds.

502
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,957
Nate Diaz.

503
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,226
He lost the second
bout by decision,

504
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:23,529
but there will
surely be a third,

505
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,296
and no matter what happens,

506
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,200
Nate Diaz always brings it.

507
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:34,173
Mariscos Chente
on South Centinela.

508
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,912
What did you... what do you eat
growing up? Like, what do you-

509
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,413
in your house,
when you were little kids,

510
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,716
what kind of food
were you eating?

511
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,484
What's lunch?

512
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,053
Macaroni and cheese
and hot dogs.

513
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:51,256
Yeah, man, hot dogs, right.

514
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,891
That was basically,
like, Top Ramen.

515
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,326
Every day.

516
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,195
- Yeah.
- Hot dogs, mac and cheese?

517
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,564
- Some ghetto juice.
- What about you?

518
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:00,566
You know, rice and beans
and some sort of Mexican dish.

519
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,167
Some sort of protein with it
and everything, you know.

520
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,569
- Right.
- I'm not vegetarian,

521
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,336
but I learned
a lot from them though.

522
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:09,207
I was, like,
pretty much vegan for...

523
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,442
For years really.
Even as a kid? No.

524
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,278
Like, I stopped
eating land animals period.

525
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,746
Like, I was... I'm a vegetarian,

526
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,748
but I've been
eating seafood on and off,

527
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,917
but I've been a vegetarian
since I was, like,

528
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,518
since I was 18 years old.

529
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,554
I just would be better cutting
weight when I would just go

530
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,623
on [inaudible] vegetarian diet.

531
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,391
- Right.
- I end up, you know,

532
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,627
nice and light,
and then I get stronger.

533
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:31,429
And then once he started
fighting pro too,

534
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,099
I think he kind of started
doing the same type of thing.

535
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,769
When you eat in LA,
if you're going out for food,

536
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,270
what are you going out for,
Asian?

537
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,772
You're going out
for Pad Thai food...

538
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,540
Good food's pretty convenient
around here, of course.

539
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,110
I go to... I go to Venice Beach.

540
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:48,914
I go to Café Gratitude,
and that's a really good place.

541
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,749
What do you eat there?

542
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,619
It's, like, vegan,
vegetarian all the way.

543
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,989
I get off the plane,
I go right to In-N-Out Burger.

544
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,325
And the last thing
I do while I'm in town

545
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,761
is I stop at In-N-Out Burger.

546
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,295
That stuff is like crack for me.

547
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,265
I got to have it.

548
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,501
Oh, it's so good.

549
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,138
Mariscos Chente serves shrimp.

550
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:15,406
Lots and lots of shrimp.

551
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,076
The house special,
camarones borrachos,

552
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,611
or drunken shrimp,

553
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:22,447
sautéed in butter
and garlic over high heat.

554
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,916
Add cilantro,
and crushed peppers,

555
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,918
and finish with tequila.

556
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:27,419
♪

557
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,131
So when was your first fight,
like, in school?

558
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,332
Like, what grade?

559
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,367
- First.
- First grade?

560
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,970
- Just kidding.
- No.

561
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,605
Yeah, [inaudible]
my first fight, right?

562
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,641
One time I was in sixth grade,

563
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,509
and I went down
to the baseball field

564
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,144
waiting for foul balls

565
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,113
because when you catch
a foul ball you get free soda

566
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,948
or a bag of chips or something.

567
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,785
And I caught the ball, and one
of the baseball players was mad

568
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,320
because a littler kid was
trying to run up and get it.

569
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,455
Like, "What's up? Why didn't you
let him get the ball?"

570
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,025
I'm like, "Shut up. I've been
waiting all day for this ball."

571
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:08,526
You know what I'm saying.
I was a little kid.

572
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,195
And he tried to get
in a fight with me,

573
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:12,030
but I'm with these guys
and they're all hard core.

574
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,665
And I'm in my head like,
"Man, why they gonna make me

575
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:17,368
fight this guy, because..."
in my head, right?

576
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,204
I was, "Man, they're making me
fight this guy."

577
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:20,706
And we're, like, going at it,

578
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:22,640
and I've never been
punched in my face

579
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,209
so many times in my life, right?

580
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,144
I was just a little kid.
He used to swing kind of wide

581
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,545
back then.
I was all heart.

582
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Why you make me fight?

583
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,718
That's mean.
Why you make me fight this guy?

584
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:48,734
Street tacos are a not guilty
at all pleasure for me,

585
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:53,939
something of an obsession,
they always make me happy.

586
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,341
But Mexican food
has been redefining itself

587
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,409
in significant ways for years,

588
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,211
here and in Mexico.

589
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:03,414
Across the city, young,
extremely talented chefs

590
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:07,753
are taking Mexican traditions
to the next level and beyond.

591
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:13,058
Maybe the most exciting new
frontier of modern cooking.

592
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,460
Chef Ray Garcia,
a native Angelino

593
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:18,263
is one of those pioneers.

594
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:21,599
Located in the heart
of downtown is Broken Spanish,

595
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,934
a higher-end,

596
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,602
higher-priced Mexican restaurant

597
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:27,939
than most are accustomed to.

598
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,576
Chef Eddie Ruiz and Robin
Chopra are childhood friends

599
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,644
who opened the wonderful,
but short-lived

600
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,081
Alta California Gastro Pub

601
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,983
Corazon y Miel,

602
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:41,152
which put them both on the map
in LA's burgeoning,

603
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,823
modern Mexican dining scene.

604
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:47,959
I absolutely believe
that the next big thing

605
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,064
is a re-evaluation of Mexican
flavors and ingredients,

606
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,467
and a re-evaluation
of how much you should pay.

607
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,237
I mean, people love it,
but their expectations is,

608
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,471
Mexican food should be cheap,

609
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,739
and the fact is there's always

610
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,641
gonna be new arrivals
from Mexico

611
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,443
who are perfectly willing
to sell you,

612
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,412
unfortunately or fortunately,

613
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:10,481
really good Mexican food
for very cheap,

614
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,318
but not the kind of deep flavors

615
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,652
that, you know, you find,

616
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:17,122
or I've found
in my travels there.

617
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:18,990
Well, sometimes
in the Mexican world

618
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,026
the only thing
that's passed down,

619
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:23,094
it's not a home,
it's not a necklace,

620
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,430
what it is is
a recipe passed down

621
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,032
from generation to generation.

622
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:30,268
It all comes from these rustic
dishes that our grandmothers

623
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,170
and grandpas cooked for us.

624
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:35,841
Do you have
any responsibility to preserve

625
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:37,542
and protect
the traditional flavors

626
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:39,210
and ingredients of Mexico

627
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:40,478
or do you- or not?

628
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,646
Yeah, of course.

629
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:42,981
Everything that you see here

630
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:44,349
in front of you is inspired

631
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,817
by something
that we had as a child,

632
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,954
but how do we present
that with our training,

633
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,189
and how do we present
that with our experience

634
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,993
that's gonna give people value
to want to pay more for it?

635
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:57,963
I think that Los Angeles
is kind of a stage

636
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,630
for that next level,

637
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,534
and Chef Ray is doing
a really good job of that.

638
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,470
He's presenting stuff like this,

639
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,305
and that's what's gonna
elevate people's mind-set

640
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:10,877
in terms of what you can do
with this food.

641
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,748
Chicharrones, skin on pork,
cured and salted,

642
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,717
cooked sous vide for 36 hours,

643
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,419
then deep fried and served

644
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,923
with elephant garlic mojo
and radish sprouts.

645
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:27,825
♪

646
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,727
Tamales of slow-cooked lamb neck

647
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:33,532
with oyster mushrooms
and queso Oaxaca.

648
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,704
Camote, an Okinawan sweet
potato filled with pork,

649
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:42,607
the ears, tails and snout,

650
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:47,212
topped with a drizzle
of piloncillo syrup.

651
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,779
I got one more present
for you guys here.

652
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,181
A little pre-dessert, Eddie.

653
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,416
I know it's your favorite,
Eddie.

654
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:52,783
It's my favorite.

655
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,886
We have the foie gras
rebanada here.

656
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,554
So it's sort of like
a pre-dessert.

657
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,023
It's my take on
a very traditional

658
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,191
and simple Mexican pan dulce.

659
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,627
Which is, like,
a brioche with butter

660
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,595
and sugar is just
the basic pan dulce.

661
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,231
So this here, we have
foie gras in our butter,

662
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,566
we kind of up
the ante a little bit,

663
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,235
and then some piloncillo.

664
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:11,602
Sweet. Thank you.

665
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,538
Man, I am loving...
I am loving this meal.

666
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,639
- Thank you.
- I mean, big-time.

667
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,942
Thank you so much. Thank you.

668
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:19,644
This is the most nostalgic dish

669
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,279
I've ever had at a restaurant
in Los Angeles.

670
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,450
In Mexican panaderías,
this is called rebanada.

671
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,785
- Wow.
- Nothing says my childhood

672
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:31,222
like this dish right here.

673
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,458
I've worked in French
and Italian restaurants

674
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:34,392
my whole career.

675
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,893
Right.

676
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,096
But, I mean, really,
if I think about it,

677
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:41,266
they're Mexican restaurants
and Ecuadorian restaurants

678
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,234
because the majority
of the cooks

679
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,071
and the people working with me
were from those countries.

680
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,673
That's who, you know,
picked me up when I fell down,

681
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,308
who showed me what to do
when I walked in

682
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,278
and didn't know anything,
and nobody knew my name.

683
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,081
Right, it's just the way
our culture is.

684
00:31:56,082 --> 00:32:00,318
We're so family oriented
that that's what matters to us.

685
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,521
At the same time
I feel like our job as chefs

686
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,157
is to bring in our unique,

687
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:10,261
Latin American experience
to dining,

688
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:14,165
family, tradition,
food, culture,

689
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,766
and LA's the heart of that
right now.

690
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,035
It really is.

691
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,636
And hopefully that resonates

692
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,639
throughout the rest
of the country.

693
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,319
Gang violence has been
part of LA's story

694
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,622
for the better part
of a century now.

695
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,224
Also part of the story,

696
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:42,494
police corruption and brutality.

697
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:49,067
Former police officer
Alex Salazar was a bad cop.

698
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:52,670
By his own admission, very bad.

699
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,672
Like a lot of once good police,

700
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:55,906
the streets changed him.

701
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,675
He saw a lot of ugliness,

702
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,644
the lines became blurred,

703
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,346
the job ground him down,

704
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:05,550
and he crossed the line...
repeatedly.

705
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,085
To quote Nietzsche,

706
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,854
"Those who chase monsters
need to be careful

707
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,656
that they don't
become monsters."

708
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,225
I thought I was gonna
arrest the bad guys.

709
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:17,163
I never thought I would become
a bad guy myself.

710
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,835
- Did you become a bad guy?
- Oh, I did, yes.

711
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,938
- How bad?
- I became very aggressive,

712
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,840
beating people, losing control,

713
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,442
and using excessive force

714
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,245
when there really wasn't
any need for me to do that.

715
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,914
I mean, I worked the most
infamous police station

716
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:39,016
ever known.
It was called Rampart.

717
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,386
Won best picture
for Denzel Washington

718
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:44,622
for his betrayal of this
really bad police officer.

719
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:45,890
I'm the police.

720
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,559
I run shit here.
You just live here.

721
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Was that an understatement?

722
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,096
Were there cops that bad?

723
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:52,563
Yes, there were,
yes, there were.

724
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:53,931
I was one of them.

725
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,933
The problem was very systemic.

726
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,103
We don't have so much
that problem anymore.

727
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,037
It does happen.
Is it not the nature of

728
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,940
the job when you're asked
to every day go in

729
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,609
and look at people

730
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,811
at their most desperate and ugly

731
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:09,880
that you become desensitized

732
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,049
and maybe
even turn into a monster?

733
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,784
Just think about it.

734
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,287
Every day they're looking
at the worst of society,

735
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:19,590
and maybe they have a partner
that gets killed or shot.

736
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,959
It's all very overwhelming.

737
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,564
Many turn to alcohol
and drugs to medicate.

738
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,999
And I'm not trying to be
an apologist for the police,

739
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,303
because, you know, they do need
to be held accountable,

740
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,672
but, you know, we need
to help them, we really do,

741
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:38,075
because they are out there,

742
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:42,113
and they're the ones that
are gonna show up at your home.

743
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:44,649
Mexican American,
living in East LA,

744
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,818

a sympathetic response?

747
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:55,660
I mean, generally speaking,
what do you think the...

748
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,329
I think most police officers
show up

749
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,131
being ready to help out.

750
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,099
They certainly have to do
their job, take a report.

751
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,934
But, I mean, what do you
think the victim thinks

752
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,170
when they place a phone call?

753
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:06,471
Do you think they have
high hopes that,

754
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:08,873
"I believe, like, my call
is gonna be handled

755
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,842
"with the same fervor

756
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,479
as somebody calling
from Beverly Hills?"

757
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,982
Well, there are good officers
that come in, and they do help.

758
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:21,786
There's also many who lose
that empathetic feeling

759
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,954
of looking at someone
with brown skin

760
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,357
or very dark skin and they say,

761
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:27,792
"Well, you know, why am I
helping out this person?

762
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,360
This is a stupid Mexican,"

763

870
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,524
- Right.
- And the songs are so much

871
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:02,292
about finding something
beautiful or even funny,

872
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,194
about getting relentlessly [...]
over

873
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,897
and having shit
go wrong; I mean...

874
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:10,668
I think Morrissey
really speaks... you know,

875
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:13,638
it's so odd,
he's this white guy...

876
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:17,241
About, like, displacement
and this longing for, like,

877
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:19,009
for a mythic home

878
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,678
because when I go to Mexico,

879
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,146
I'm like a sore thumb there,
you know?

880
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,148
My Spanish is horrible,

881
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,382
the way I dress, the way I talk,

882
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,351
but there's just
something about it.

883
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:31,055
Like, Morrissey really
articulates that experience.

884
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,757
He himself is an immigrant.

885
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:34,024
He is Irish.

886
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,926
You know, he feels displaced.

889

00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:47,171
You're never white enough
for this country,

891
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,574
and you're never
brown enough for Mexico.

892
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:53,043
It is a big issue
about that pocho and all that,

893
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:55,946
but I know that we are...

894
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:59,416
