- For the whole country.
- Yes, for the whole country.

48
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,800
And nine miles of paved road
in Muscat.

49

Muscat was really of no concern

Absolutely, yes.

He's presided over everything
Omani for the last 47 years.

largely secular society.

69

Electricity, water,
heath care, education.

00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,400
and military advisors,
was engaged in a war

179
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:01,700
in the country's southern
Dhofar region

180
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,833
that was in every way
far more vital

181
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:06,733
to American security interests

182
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,200
and of far more importance

183
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:12,500
to global strategic
and economic concerns.

184
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:16,867
Where we operated
were the frankincense trees.

185
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,500
The frankincense that the Wise
men brought to Christ.

186
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,233
All the sudden,
they came through mountains

187
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:23,200
where we were fighting.

188
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,200
And you're sitting
behind a machine gun

189
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:34,400
on a track, which had been used
for 3,00 years.

190
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:37,100
One felt like an intruder
in history.

191
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,700
And if the trees were cut,

192
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:43,233
you could smell
the frankincense.

193
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:47,167
The smell of explosives.

194
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
The smell of blood.

195
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:56,067
The smell of the food.
Cardamom, the smell of the tea.

196
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
I loved it.

197
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,200
This was a civil war.

198
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:03,233
Civil wars, typically,
are the worst wars of all.

199
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,467
I mean, you know that
well enough in your country.

200
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,900
But most people
have not heard of it.

201
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:10,100
No, they haven't.
But you'd have heard about it

202
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:13,300
if we'd lost it, I can tell you.
Right.

203
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,300
The war began
as a local rebellion

204
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,733
by the Dhofari people
against the autocratic

205
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:22,167
and outdated rule of then
Sultan, Said bin Taimur,

206
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,700
who had kept his nation
isolated and stunted

207
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:27,167
out of his concern
for his hold on power.

208
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,567
What started as a local uprising

209
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,967
quickly became a serious,
full-blown,

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,700
communist-backed insurgency,

211
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:39,133
as Soviet and Chinese influence
poured in through Yemen.

212
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:45,500
Ian Gardner remembers
the conflict well.

213
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,333
He fought in it,
alongside Omani infantry

214
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,100
as a British Royal Marine.

215
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:51,633
And later wrote about
the experience

216
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:54,367
in his memoir,
"In the Service of the Sultan,"

217
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,733
a rare chronicle of the brutal,
incredibly difficult

218
00:13:57,767 --> 00:14:00,467
and almost entirely unknown war,

219
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
fought in the rugged
southern mountains.

220
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:05,533
The old Sultan was not
an inhuman man.

221
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,267
But he was an old man.
He was deeply reactionary.

222
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,467
So he wanted to keep his country
in a medieval time warp.

223
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,467
The thing that changed it
was the advent of

224
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,800
the Japanese transistor radio.

225
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,033
And the first time,
his people could hear

226
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,500
what the other Arab countries
were doing with their oil.

227
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,267
And they wanted some of that.

228
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,733
By the 1920s, Winston
Churchill had switched

229
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,967
the British Royal Navy's
mode of power

230
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,367
from coal to oil.

231
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,767
And suddenly,
everything changed.

232
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,567
They needed oil and lots of it.

233
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,367
Which made Oman vital.

234
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,833
Not for its limited
oil resources,

235
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,467

He was deposed by his son,
Qaboos bin Said al Said,

245

in a relatively bloodless coup.

246
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:10,733
Immediately,
the young Sultan set out

247
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,300
on a different tact
for winning the war.

248
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,333
Longs before
the shooting had stopped,

249
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:19,167
we would institute
a civil aid program.

250
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,067
Build roads, build a school,
build a mosque,

251
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,467
build some shops, a clinic.

252
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
But was in this way
the Sultan was able

253
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:29,633
to demonstrate
that he was the one

post-insurgency

258
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,700
This tactic failed spectacularly
in Vietnam, of course.

What made the difference here?
