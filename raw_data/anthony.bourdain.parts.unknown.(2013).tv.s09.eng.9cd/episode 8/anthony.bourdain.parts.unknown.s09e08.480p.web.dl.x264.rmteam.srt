1
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,410
Everything old is new again.

2
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,011
Maybe not.

3
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,913
I come close
sometimes to believing

4
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:22,015
that nothing actually
ever changes.

5
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:29,090
Back in the beginning,
fresh out of the kitchen,

6
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,921
when I first went out
in the world

7
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:33,223
trying to figure out
how to make television,

8
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:36,425
I came to Northern Portugal.

9
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:38,196
Little did I know
what I would find.

10
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:42,099
Up until then,

11
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,400
for 30 years spent
working in kitchens,

12
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,572
meat had come
wrapped in plastic.

13
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:48,503
I'd order it in boxes.

14
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,335
I had never seen an animal die

15
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,906
because I was making dinner.

16
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:54,777
Ooh.

17
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:03,083
Hi.
How are you guys doing?

18
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:15,221
Oh, man, they can be so cruel.

19
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:41,468
All right, ciao.

20
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:45,271
Oh, man. Oof.

21
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:47,973
I had to call the crisis center.

22
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:05,224
Portugal, sandwiched between
Spain and the Atlantic Ocean,

23
00:04:05,254 --> 00:04:06,985
and tiny as countries go,

24
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,987
has had an outsized impact
on the world.

25
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:13,390
During the Age of Discovery,

26
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,961
the Portuguese went to sea
in great numbers,

27
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:20,364
and gained fame as navigators,
ship builders, and explorers.

28
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:23,937
They conquered
a large part of the world,

29
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:26,268
their empire stretching
from Brazil,

30
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:29,040
to Africa, to the East Indies.

31
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,104
The city of Oporto
is a reflection

32
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:39,607
and a creation of that
relationship with the sea.

33
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:43,179
A lot has changed
since I was last here.

34
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:44,250
Or has it?

35
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:05,825
When I decided to return

36
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:07,796
to take another look
at this place,

37
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,827
I, of course, reached out
to Jose de Meirelles,

38
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:12,469
my old boss and
first entre to Portugal.

39
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:13,700
How you doing, man?

40
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,371
- You look good.
- You good?

41
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,833
- Yeah, nice to see you.
- It's been a long, long time.

42
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:20,034
Jose is from the area
around Oporto,

43
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:22,035
and this time,
just like back then,

44
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:25,438
he said "Come, see
my country, meet my family."

45
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:26,538
We'll do a pig feast."

46
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:28,039
16 years later.

47
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,981
I came here in 2001,
one of the first times

48
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,783
I've ever been on television,
and here we are again.

49
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:36,285
There are only so many beautiful
places left in the world.

50
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,387
Oporto is one of them.
It's gorgeous.

51
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,048
Has it changed too much?

52
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:42,889
Eh, yes, especially
in the big cities.

53
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,991
Especially Oporto,
it change a lot.

54
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,652
It was never too rich town.

55
00:05:46,692 --> 00:05:48,853
Now it's packed with tourists.

56
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,510
So that's... is that
good news or bad news?

57
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:51,895
- Yeah, it's good news.
- Good news.

58
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:53,626
I mean, it's good
for the economy,

59
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:55,127
and especially it came up

60
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,159
during the big financial
crisis and all that.

61
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,331
So it was a great job
for the city.

62
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:03,803
I mean, it looks even prettier
than it looked last time.

63
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,035
They seem to have fixed up
a lot of buildings.

64
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,248
So what are we eating here?
It's the specialty?

65
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:28,179
Oh, actually we're gonna
start with.

66
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,181
That's small sardines.

67
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:37,856
You eat everything. The bones.
You eat the whole thing.

68
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:39,757
You can eat a thousand of them,

69
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:41,528
and the plate is empty
so that's a good thing.

70
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:43,360
Nobody can tell you
how many you eat.

71
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,432
You ready for the tripes?

72
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:48,263
- Yes.
- Absolutely, let's go.

73
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:53,236
- Tripeiros, right?
- Tripas.

74
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:56,338
We are known as the tripas,
that's tripe people.

75
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:58,600
Why?

76
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:07,175
Right.

77
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:10,548
The people from Oporto gave
them all the meat they had.

78
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:12,209
- So they...
- All they're left with...

79
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:13,610
Just with the tripes.

80
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,111
It's cheap food for the sailors.

81
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:16,412
It would last a long time.

82
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:17,712
And it usually is on Thursday.

83
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:19,113
That's the day with the tripes,

84
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:20,755
because being
a Catholic country,

85
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:23,386
on Friday, they skip the meat.

86
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:29,961
A meal here is, generally
speaking anyway, not light.

87
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,922
The Portuguese like pork.

88
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:33,793
They like it a lot.

89
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:35,464
So sausage, bacon.

90
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:38,096
- Sausage, pig's ear.
- Cured pig's ear.

91
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:39,867
What do you do
when left with nothing

92
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:42,029
but guts and hooves
and odd bits?

93
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,700
You have the tripes here,
some beans.

94
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,772
Figure out how to transform that

95
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:50,174
into delicious,
delicious things, of course.

96
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,540
Oh, wow, look at that.

97
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,081
Oh, that's fantastic.

98
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:01,882
- It smells delicious.
- Perfect. Yes, it does.

99
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:04,143
So I put a little rice on
the side there to mop it up?

100
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,644
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:10,087
Mmm.

102
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:12,489
That is good.

103
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,031
Mmm.

104
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:35,664
I mean, it's sort of incredible
the story of the wines here.

105
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:38,066
I hear that because the soil

106
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:40,568
is so tough with flint
and stones also,

107
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:44,740
the vines have to dig
up to 30 meters down.

108
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,512
But it's a lot.

109
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,643
I think it gives the wine
a special character.

110
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,347
Northern Portugal's Douro Valley

111
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:55,778
is where Port comes from.

112
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,352
If it's not from here,
it's not Port.

113
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:03,353
It's just fortified wine.

114
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,332
I don't usually do wine scenes.

115
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:19,464
No matter how good the wine,
on camera

116
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:22,536
it's just colored liquid
going into a glass.

117
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,467
Wine nerds usually bore me.

118
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,369
Don't talk about
your damn wine, drink it.

119
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,372
But I absolutely love
cheese served

120
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:34,304
with a glass of Port wine,

121
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:37,205
and that's what most people,
including my new friend Andre,

122
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:39,007
that's what they do around here.

123
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:41,208
I'm not a dessert guy,
but a nice blue cheese

124
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,710
with a glass of port,
for me, is, like,

125
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,382
the perfect thing
to end a meal with.

126
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:49,714
Unlike wine,
cheese porn is easy.

127
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,785
Just like shooting actual porn.

128
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:55,458
Start with an establishing
shot, move in for a close...

129
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,019
Oh, yeah, there we go.

130
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:58,890
...cut away to a reaction.

131
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,690
Mmm.

132
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,721
Money.

133
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:02,392
Works every time.

134
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:05,865
Oh, that's disturbing.
I mean, it's delicious.

135
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:08,066
What kind of cheeses
are we looking at here?

136
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:10,828
These two over here,
they're goat cheese.

137
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,069
They're aged ones.

138
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:14,530
Then all the other
are sheep milk.

139
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,902
This is worldly known
Queijo Serra,

140
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:18,733
so the buttery one.

141
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:21,175
This is what we call
a Queijo Azeitao.

142
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,736
It's strong,
intense to your palate.

143
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:24,537
Oh, I like this guy already.

144
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:26,809
Any cheese that are, like,
you need a spoon pretty much.

145
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,410
Oh, then smell it.
For me, the worse the smell,

146
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,881
the better the flavor.

147
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:32,813
- Mmm.
- Huh? Like it?

148
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:35,344
Smells like dirty feet.
Tastes like heaven.

149
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:39,087
This is a 30-year-old Port.

150
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:18,443
- Oh, that's delicious.
- Yeah.

151
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:19,744
Put a little bit of that

152
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:21,615
and then some pumpkin jam
on top.

153
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:24,417
Mmm. If I put on my Speedo
and dive into this thing,

154
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:28,380
please stop me before
I completely face plant.

155
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,074
Oh, no, no, no.
I love Portuguese gastronomy.

156
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:32,452
The heart and soul of it,
its simplicity.

157
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,023
Look, that's the thing

158
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:35,978
that makes me fall in love
with it every single day.

159
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,756
Cheese is one of those things,
it's always magic to me

160
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:42,689
because it goes
into the cave one way

161
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,390
and then you go in
and you pull it out,

162
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,861
and, I don't believe in God,

163
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:47,592
but somehow
it went in like that,

164
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:49,294
and it came back like this.

165
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:53,937
Relying on time to cut his way
through it and to change this.

166
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:57,269
Change the texture,
even the smell,

167
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:02,242
and we have nothing to do with
that other than enjoying it.

168
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:59,841
Portugal has got
a lot of coastline

169
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:02,012
and a lot of history
with the sea.

170
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,183
It's a close relationship,

171
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,245
one that's imprinted deep
within the national character.

172
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:09,447
The songs.
The poetry.

173
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:10,848
The state of mind.

174
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:13,189
I love this word, saudade.

175
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:19,994
Saudade means missing
something. Nostalgic.

176
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:26,298
A word with no direct
translation to English.

177
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:29,660
It connotes longing,
being away from something,

178
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,302
and yearning to get back.

179
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:33,333
The Portuguese went out
of the country

180
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:35,935
for years at sea,
and he does not know

181
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:38,766
when he's gonna get back
to his family.

182
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:50,875
During the cold gray months,
it's lamprey season.

183
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,446
Oh, hell yeah.

184
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:54,217
So I'm here
at just the right time.

185
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:55,741
What do you call
this dish in Portuguese?

186
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,149
This is the lamprey eel?

187
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,450
Yeah, the lamprey bordelaise.

188
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,221
Awesome.

189
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:06,385
Lamprey are butt ugly
damn creatures,

190
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,656
but delicious when cooked right,

191
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:11,388
and my man Pedro
knows how to cook it right.

192
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:13,229
Very traditional.
Cooked in its own blood.

193
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:15,191
Yeah, it's bordelaise style.

194
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:17,662
When it's bordelaise,
it means it has the blood.

195
00:14:38,947 --> 00:14:41,748
Mmm, it's good.
Fantastic.

196
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:44,680
Saudad is going back to a moment

197
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,081
where you're happy.

198
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:48,083
It doesn't matter
if it was through food,

199
00:14:48,113 --> 00:14:50,254
through sex, through wherever.

200
00:14:50,284 --> 00:14:52,108
You're making me sad
already thinking about this.

201
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:53,416
No, but that's not sad.

202
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,017
- I'm getting depressed.
- Come on.

203
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:56,251
Yes, thinking about happy times

204
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:57,759
that I can't have right now.

205
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:59,420
But there's a hope in the future

206
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,585
that that's going to happen
because that's also part of...

207
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:03,893
- Yeah, no.
- Yeah, I see it like that.

208
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:05,594
If you don't see it,
that's your problem.

209
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:22,936
The Portuguese were
the original navigators.

210
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:24,737
Yeah.

211
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:27,939
It was about the sea.
About fishing, exploration.

212
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:50,855
Ah, question.
I went to the fish market.

213
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:53,356
I met these women
who sell fish there,

214
00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:55,858
and they were saying terrible,
terrible things to me.

215
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:57,922
They were saying, "Hey,
pin dick, get over... you know",

216
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,461
how do you satisfy your wife
with that tiny little penis?"

217
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,464
My God, I've never
in my life heard women,

218
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:05,965
anybody speak like this.

219
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:09,807
This is what I'm gonna get?

220
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,408
Yeah, nasty approaches

221
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,069
about your penis
and your height, yeah.

222
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:37,295
I'm Tony, hi.

223
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:38,867
- I'm Sophia.
- Sophia.

224
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:40,368
I'm Shanna.
Nice to meet you.

225
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:42,599
- Hi. Good to meet you both.
- How are you?

226
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,670
Those of you who know me
even a little bit

227
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,802
are familiar
with my unholy attraction

228
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,373
to the mutant hot dog.

229
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:50,374
Is it actually called
a hot dog here or is it...

230
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,206
- No, here we call it cachorro.
- Cachorro.

231
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:55,037
Toasted bread.
Fresh sausage.

232
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:56,478
Fresh pork sausage.

233
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,110
And a cheese and a spicy sauce.

234
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,811
And spicy sauce.

235
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,385
And cut in a very specific way.

236
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:08,786
Wow, look at...
Fast knife work.

237
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,289
Nah.

238
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,391
He's asking if you want
some fork and knife.

239
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,152
No, we can eat it with the...

240
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:18,693
No, we don't do that, right?

241
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:23,726
Mmm. This is delicious.

242
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:25,398
This is very healthy too.

243
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:27,399
Yeah, it's a light dinner.

244
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:28,830
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.

245
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,562
No, no, no, yeah, it is.

246
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:34,734
- They're busy.
- Yeah, they're always busy.

247
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:36,565
- Yeah, always busy.
- It's a small place.

248
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:40,237
And you can see it's just
Portuguese, just locals.

249
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,239
How many places
like this in town?

250
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:44,410
Nowadays, not many.

251
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,542
- Now, you guys own a tavern?
- Yes.

252
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:48,473
How's employment
in Portugal now?

253
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:51,175
There's a lot
of unemployment here.

254
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,576
No, I was gonna ask,

255
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:55,247
do you get a lot
of people with degrees,

256
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:58,380
you know, higher degrees
who are opening restaurants?

257
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,521
Yes. She has the degree
in psychology.

258
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:02,722
I have the degree in sociology.

259
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:06,255
And everyone who is working
with us they have the degree.

260
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:09,427
- Yeah, or they are finishing.
- Or they are finishing.

261
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:10,758
I might have to have another.

262
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:13,159
That was good.

263
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,118
This city seems to have
been preserved carefully

264
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:43,420
and with respect for the past.

265
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,151
I don't see a lot
of high rise buildings

266
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:47,122
breaking up the skyline.

267
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:49,494
We are still very authentic.
We don't sell out very easily.

268
00:20:49,524 --> 00:20:51,255
I mean, I was
in a relatively poor

269
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:52,826
neighborhood
a couple of nights ago

270
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:54,757
just walking around,
and somebody said,

271
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:57,329
"You know, you could buy
that apartment building

272
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,130
right there for $50,000."

273
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,461
I said, "Okay, good deal."

274
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:02,162
"But you can't touch
the exterior."

275
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:05,905
Yeah, no.

276
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:08,566
This is the fishing
and port area of Oporto, yes?

277
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:10,267
And it's called Matosinhos.

278
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:12,069
The fishing boats just arrived,

279
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:15,941
and the market is just
two streets away from here.

280
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,281
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

281
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:32,953
Seafood tower, bitches.
All right then.

282
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:35,154
Okay, not a tower precisely,

283
00:21:35,184 --> 00:21:38,786
but a whole heap of incredible
creatures from the sea.

284
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:43,329
Coastal shrimp.

285
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,961
Local oysters

286
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:48,033
and crab.

287
00:21:48,063 --> 00:21:49,534
Sea urchin.

288
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:51,935
Langoustine.
Gooseneck barnacles.

289
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:53,366
This I'm very excited by.

290
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,498
- Yeah.
- So dangerous to get these.

291
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:57,199
Yeah, it's not
the thing that you get

292
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,370
from the hulls of the boats,
but from rocks.

293
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,341
And you've got to get it
in between waves.

294
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:03,543
- Mm-hmm.
- Quickly. Whelks?

295
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:07,045
- Caramujos.
- Caramujos.

296
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,206
Oh, there we go.

297
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:10,648
Mmm. Insane.

298
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:13,209
One thing that I don't like
with food is sauce.

299
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,281
Yeah, I don't need it.
This is all perfect.

300
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:16,575
What do they do to it?
They steamed it, some of it.

301
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:18,313
- Yeah.
- The rest is raw.

302
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:20,354
It's not like this
is fancy cooking.

303
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,860
Mmm.
This crab is...

304
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,392
It's like a Rubik's cube.

305
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:33,223
I'm trying to figure
my way into here.

306
00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:36,125
Okay, I found it.

307
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:40,498
This is the thing that
gets you back to your roots.

308
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:43,029
You have to use your hands.
You don't have to be polite.

309
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,030
Yeah.

310
00:22:53,276 --> 00:22:54,677
Mmm, these little shrimp.

311
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,178
The brains are really good too.

312
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,981
Oh, look at that.

313
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,742
Sea urchin, fat sacks of roe

314
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:05,644
buried deep inside
these prickly exteriors.

315
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,087
When I was a kid, I went
with my father to get these,

316
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:13,089
and it was nasty,
but also very good.

317
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,921
Mmm.

318
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:16,592
It's funny, a lot of things

319
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:19,394
that you see here
were used as fertilizer.

320
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:22,155
In the years before
independence in Massachusetts,

321
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:23,656
Lobster was seen as a pest.

322
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:25,398
The only people
who used them regularly

323
00:23:25,428 --> 00:23:27,029
was the prison system.

324
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,200
The prisoners rioted because
they said this is cruel

325
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,361
and unusual punishment having
to eat lobster every day.

326
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:33,203
"No, I don't want that.
It's lobster."

327
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,942
Nobody knows who first
salt-baked a fish.

328
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:48,343
Maybe it was Jesus.

329
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:50,514
- Ohhh.
- Oh, wow.

330
00:23:50,544 --> 00:23:53,546
Scale and gut your fish,
in this case a sea bass,

331
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:55,418
insert lemon and onion,

332
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:57,319
then pack it in salt and bake.

333
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,253
Light the whole thing
on fire tableside,

334
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:05,854
then break open.

335
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:07,886
The salt acts like
a protective crust,

336
00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:10,458
sealing in all
the moisture and flavor.

337
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:13,930
Now, that looks beautiful.
That's perfect food.

338
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,631
Mmm.

339
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:17,632
Clams cooked Portuguese style.

340
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:19,734
- Yeah.
- So tender and sweet

341
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:21,635
and delicious.

342
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:23,266
Why do you think Portuguese food

343
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,438
has not had a higher profile
internationally?

344
00:24:25,468 --> 00:24:30,241
Well, for me it's
real easy to say this,

345
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:31,942
it's basically...
It's your fault.

346
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,903
- Our fault?
- It's the Americans' fault.

347
00:24:33,943 --> 00:24:35,274
Yeah.
Why?

348
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:37,305
The American culture
embraced Spain.

349
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:39,807
It embraced Italy.
It embraced France.

350
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:43,109
It didn't embrace Portugal
because... I don't know.

351
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,081
If we have a civil war

352
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:47,482
so popular like the Spanish had,

353
00:24:47,512 --> 00:24:49,584
and Hemmingway came
to Portugal instead of Spain,

354
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,985
we would be a different country.

355
00:24:52,015 --> 00:24:54,117
You know, you think of Italy,
you think of romance.

356
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:56,488
- No, but we are romantic.
- I know. These people...

357
00:24:56,518 --> 00:24:58,327
We are the most romantic
country in the world.

358
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,061
After you have a couple
of meals in Porto,

359
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:03,493
you're going to feel saudade
in your heart and soul.

360
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:07,466
Man, good meal.
Oh, what, there's more clams?

361
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:10,167
Right over here, my friend.

362
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:51,255
Contrary to what some might say,

363
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:55,528
I do not enjoy seeing
the death of any living thing.

364
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,159
I do not promote animal cruelty.

365
00:26:18,573 --> 00:26:20,514
- Yeah, ready to go?
- Yep.

366
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,876
Kill the pig, kill the pig,
kill the pig.

367
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,479
But I think people should
know where meat comes from,

368
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,051
and knowing, they should
feel free to decide

369
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:32,382
what they want to do from there.

370
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:40,758
- It's the least you could do.
- Yeah, exactly, so...

371
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:45,891
Here, right here
on Jose's family farm,

372
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:48,533
is where I saw
my first animal die.

373
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:50,234
A pig too.

374
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:52,295
This, after years and decades

375
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:54,067
of being a chef, serving meat,

376
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:55,798
ordering up my death
over the phone

377
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:57,839
at a comfortable distance.

378
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:00,671
Up close, it was not
so comfortable.

379
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:02,672
I think he's starting
to get the bad news.

380
00:27:02,702 --> 00:27:05,004
I guess on the DNA, they know
that's gonna happen and...

381
00:27:05,044 --> 00:27:06,845
They know it's coming.

382
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,869
- Really they know it's coming.
- Yeah, well the pigs are smart.

383
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:11,979
And sometimes
they manage to run away.

384
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:15,551
To do the job right,
professionals are brought in,

385
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:17,182
and they do it
like this because,

386
00:27:17,212 --> 00:27:19,654
how shall I put it,
they need the heart

387
00:27:19,684 --> 00:27:22,185
to keep pumping the blood
into the pail

388
00:27:22,215 --> 00:27:24,057
for sausage and soup,

389
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:26,088
and many delicious things.

390
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:41,068
We all come to this in the end,

391
00:27:41,098 --> 00:27:43,399
whether struggling for air
in our beds,

392
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,601
bleeding out on cold concrete,

393
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:49,033
a last mighty dump like Elvis,

394
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:50,534
or this.

395
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:06,245
Oh, yeah, it's a firecracker.

396
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:10,688
That's the start of
any festivities in Portugal,

397
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:13,289
is the firecracker.
Really?

398
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,692
As befitting tradition
and the way things are done,

399
00:28:16,722 --> 00:28:18,893
this is a once in a year event.

400
00:28:18,923 --> 00:28:21,025
For two days, extended family,

401
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:23,126
friends and neighbors
gather to cook,

402
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:25,027
cure and eat a pig.

403
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:27,259
Time for a haircut?
Yeah, haircut.

404
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,030
- Old-school.
- Yeah.

405
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:36,705
They finish up
with the blowtorch.

406
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:39,467
- As one must.
- Yeah.

407
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:56,548
It's like rappers.

408
00:28:56,578 --> 00:28:58,249
Yeah, yeah,
that's it, that's it.

409
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,021
Free style.

410
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,640
Up.

411
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,242
Up. There you go.

412
00:29:34,804 --> 00:29:37,606
So now they gonna finish up
and take all the guts out...

413
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:40,007
Take all the guts out,
and that is lunch.

414
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:41,678
Lunch time.

415
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,409
In Portugal, we used to say

416
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,311
that if we want
to know our body,

417
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:48,253
you have to kill a pig because
it's absolutely the same.

418
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:51,985
All the organs are placed
on the same disposition.

419
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:54,817
I see a liver there
and the heart,

420
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:56,658
and you have
the tongue there too.

421
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:59,360
That's all in a package,
all the good stuff.

422
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:02,963
Look, it's a lung.

423
00:30:05,894 --> 00:30:07,125
He's good.

424
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:09,027
Yeah, he really knows
what he's doing.

425
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,868
I would say a surgeon,
but he's faster than a surgeon.

426
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,806
Guts removed, the liver
and heart are used today.

427
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:24,377
Cooked immediately.

428
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,338
Oh, this is the best, the heart.

429
00:30:26,378 --> 00:30:29,380
- It's like a tender sirloin.
- Oh, it's so good.

430
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,681
It's so good, yeah.

431
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:32,212
The intestines washed

432
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:34,844
and reserved for sausage casing.

433
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,786
Mmm. Looks nice.

434
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:41,388
The rest is left to hang
until tomorrow,

435
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,990
when we shall feast again.

436
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:51,655
- Ah, it's like chicharron.
- Chicharron.

437
00:30:53,026 --> 00:30:54,527
Oh, wow.

438
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:56,858
Yeah, yeah.

439
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:59,930
Oh.
That's kind of perfect.

440
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,204
Mmm.
That's good.

441
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:08,006
Not all of the countries
eat all of the meat

442
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:09,237
off of the pork.

443
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,768
And here, we eat everything.

444
00:31:18,273 --> 00:31:20,674
- They don't waste anything.
- Anything.

445
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:20,184
Fado, the national music
of Portugal.

446
00:32:20,214 --> 00:32:22,886
Songs of longing, heartbreak,

447
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:25,117
saudade set to music.

448
00:32:46,972 --> 00:32:48,773
Anthony, in Portugal

449
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:51,875
everybody thinks
that they sing Fado.

450
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:54,637
We, the Portuguese,
think that the Fado

451
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:56,938
is not the perfection,

452
00:32:56,979 --> 00:33:00,241
the ability, the fine-tuning.

453
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:05,314
It's emotion, so everybody's
allowed to sing.

454
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:06,885
Yeah.

455
00:33:06,915 --> 00:33:09,547
That's why Jose is
telling that I sing Fado.

456
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,218
I see.

457
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:15,051
Normally the guys who sing
Fado are very happy guys.

458
00:33:15,091 --> 00:33:18,323
They are very...
But when they begin to sing,

459
00:33:18,353 --> 00:33:20,154
they turn into sad guys.

460
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:21,725
I don't know why.

461
00:33:21,755 --> 00:33:24,957
Well, you said
the Portuguese are bipolar.

462
00:33:24,997 --> 00:33:27,229
Yes, yes they are.
They are.

463
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,502
So ready to eat, I see, huh?
Big enough table?

464
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:40,267
The home of Jose's
ancestors for centuries.

465
00:33:40,307 --> 00:33:44,840
Much of their original estate
still in family hands.

466
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:55,447
Very exciting.

467
00:33:55,477 --> 00:33:57,619
Jose's mother Maria
is in charge today.

468
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:01,051
She's preparing a feast of
rustic Portuguese soul food.

469
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:13,129
They boil the bones out,

470
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,184
then they finish with the
blood, so... blood and bread.

471
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:17,993
- Blood and bread.
- Yeah.

472
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:20,334
Mmm.

473
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:22,435
Beautiful.

474
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,740
It's so good.

475
00:34:36,645 --> 00:34:40,708
The main event, cozido,

476
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:44,480
a glorious stew of seemingly
every last part of the pig.

477
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,712
I'm gonna give you
some of the pernil,

478
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,153
that is the smoked meat.

479
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,714
Spare ribs.

480
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:52,686
Nothing goes to waste
around here.

481
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,717
The blood sausage.
Cabbage.

482
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:56,888
- Oh, what's that?
- That's the butelo.

483
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:00,191
It's the pig's bladder
that's stuffed with pork belly,

484
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:02,462
the spare ribs, and then smoked.

485
00:35:02,492 --> 00:35:04,323
Wow, look at that.

486
00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:08,126
Extraordinary.

487
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:15,531
And one little thing,
you don't feel that guilty

488
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,732
when you eating this
because it's only just boiled.

489
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:21,305
Not fried. Not...
Oh, I don't feel guilty.

490
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:25,407
Oh, it's fantastic.
Oh, it's superb.

491
00:35:25,437 --> 00:35:28,409
Wonderful.
Thank you.

492
00:35:35,614 --> 00:35:37,546
So, Jose,
what's left of the pig?

493
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:39,247
A couple of hams
and not much else.

494
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:41,548
Well, the everything
is on salt right now.

495
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:44,250
So the shoulders
and the legs are in salt?

496
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,907
They're on salt.
They're gonna be in salt

497
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:47,422
for about three months,

498
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:49,423
and then they're going
to be smoked

499
00:35:49,453 --> 00:35:51,355
and they are a prosciutto.

500
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:54,757
And they are fantastic.

501
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:57,729
So you spoke about
Fado and sadness,

502
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:00,661
but, you know,
after a few drinks,

503
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,102
everybody gets very happy,
you know?

504
00:36:02,132 --> 00:36:04,764
Good.

505
00:36:04,804 --> 00:36:06,735
Means, "With wine, happiness."

506
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,106
- Yeah!
- Cheers.

507
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:10,167
- Yeah.
- Happiness, happiness.

508
00:36:10,207 --> 00:36:12,669
Thank you.

509
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,020
Cheers.

510
00:38:18,853 --> 00:38:22,155
Now it's time
for the francesinha,

511
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:25,497
which translates
as little French girl?

512
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:26,828
Yeah, yeah.

513
00:38:26,858 --> 00:38:28,222
But I understand
she's not so little.

514
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:29,800
- No, it's not.
- No.

515
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,602
It's your first time,
francesinha?

516
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:33,333
- It is.
- Really?

517
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:35,634
You have this look
on your face like...

518
00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:37,205
You look worried.

519
00:38:37,235 --> 00:38:40,307
- Good luck.
- It's gonna be okay, right?

520
00:38:40,337 --> 00:38:42,609
Oh, here we go.

521
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,940
- Oh, thank you.
- What do we got?

522
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,942
Good Lord, look at that thing.

523
00:38:46,972 --> 00:38:49,343
Is there a vegetable in there?

524
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:51,475
- Only meat.
- Oh, my God.

525
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:53,846
It weighs, like, a ton.

526
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,884
So it's bread, ham...

527
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:06,885
Mm-hmm.

528
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:08,826
Steak...

529
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:10,387
Sausage, and a bit of...

530
00:39:10,427 --> 00:39:12,489
- Linguica.
- Yeah, linguica.

531
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:18,663
And then the sauce
has many things like beer,

532
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:22,966
Port wine, spicy, tomato.

533
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:25,898
- Cheese.
- A lot of cheese. A lot.

534
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:28,069
Wow.

535
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,241
What a construction.

536
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:34,844
Meat, cheese, fat and bread?
It's the immortal combination.

537
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,305
Yeah, it's the ultimate solution

538
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:38,206
for a hangover or too much pork.

539
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,181
That is delicious.

540
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:48,012
Oh, that's good.
It's really, really good.

541
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,884
Are there a lot
of places making this?

542
00:39:49,914 --> 00:39:51,085
- Mmm.
- A lot.

543
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:52,656
- Yeah.
- Everyone does.

544
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:54,917
And this is a Oporto
thing specifically?

545
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:57,689
- Yes.
- Yeah.

546
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,660
What's the relative rate

547
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:03,663
per capita of heart-related
disease in this country?

548
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,094
I'm just curious.

549
00:40:05,124 --> 00:40:07,666
It depends on how many
francesinha you had.

550
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,697
Oh, right.

551
00:40:40,948 --> 00:40:44,050
Oh-oh, oh-oh.
How are you doing?

552
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:50,254
No, I don't know. Today?
You guys need any fish?

553
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:52,055
Thank you.

554
00:41:41,028 --> 00:41:44,660
Everything old is new again,
maybe not.

555
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,232
I come close sometimes
to believing

556
00:41:47,262 --> 00:41:49,493
that nothing
actually ever changes,

557
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:51,895
that we are trapped
in our destiny,

558
00:41:51,935 --> 00:41:53,466
hurtling or limping

559
00:41:53,496 --> 00:41:55,968
or being dragged
towards the inevitable.

560
00:41:55,998 --> 00:41:59,000
That saudade refers
not to a long-lost place,

561
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,601
but a long-lost time

562
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:03,173
when we were all
young and innocent.

563
00:42:03,203 --> 00:42:06,305
Saudade can help
you value things.

564
00:42:06,345 --> 00:42:09,677
Be grateful for just a sunset.
Enjoy that. Smile.

565
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:11,578
- Enjoy it now.
- Yes.

566
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:12,779
Because tomorrow we die.

567
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:13,950
Yeah, you never know.
