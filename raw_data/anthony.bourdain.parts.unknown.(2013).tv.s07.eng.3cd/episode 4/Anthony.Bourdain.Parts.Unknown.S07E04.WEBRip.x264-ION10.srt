1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:07,089
Some people must live in great spaces...
where the sky

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:13,430
goes on forever... where everyone
must bend to the land...

3
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:17,518
where to hunt, to fish, to
sleep under that big sky

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,271
aren't activities,
but a way of life.

5
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,232
It was between here
and those mountains

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:28,737
that Cheyenne and Crow
battle took place.

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,239
But I like it.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,699
It's very peaceful, huh?

9
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,120
What was it like 100
years ago, 200 years ago?

10
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,914
Oh, not much different.

11
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,082
This was never forested.

12
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:46,234
This is the dry side of the
river, 'cause the primary winds

13
00:00:46,235 --> 00:00:48,173
come from the west.

14
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,968
And rain tends to
blow over here.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,095
That brings the snow
to the mountains.

16
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,162
Legendary writer and
poet Jim Harrison

17
00:00:57,163 --> 00:01:00,081
is one of those people,
and this is the place

18
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:01,729
he calls home.

Maybe not.

34
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:03,082
Time is a mystery that
could tip us upside down.

35
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,170
Yesterday I was
seven in the woods.

36
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,132
A bandage covered my blind eye.

37
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:18,472
68 years later, I can still
inhabit that boy's body

38
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:22,059
without thinking of
the time in between.

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,589
It is the burden of life to
be many ages without seeing

40
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,111
the end of time.

41
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:43,142
Next time you turn off a news
cycle filled with shouting

42
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:46,207
bobbleheads convinced
that America is devolving

43
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,732
into a moronic inferno,
questioning the greatness

44
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:54,466
of your nation, maybe
you should come here.

45
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,386
Here are your purple
mountains majesty.

46
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,223
This is the landscape that
generations of dreamers,

47
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,290
despots, adventurers, explorers,
crackpots, and heroes

48
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,313
fought and died for.

49
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:12,151
It's one of the most
beautiful places on Earth.

50
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,696
There is no place like it.

51
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,238
Montana.

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,241
Many have come to claim
their piece over the years.

53
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,620
But before the prospectors
and explorers,

54
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,246
there were the Plains Indians.

55
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,858
The Absaroka have been master
horsemen since they adopted

56
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,465
Spanish-introduced mustangs
in the 18th century.

57
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,425
General "Black Jack"

58
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,678
Pershing... he called
the Native Americans

59
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,889
the centaurs of the plains.

60
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,725
Better known as the Crow,
they were once part

61
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:46,143
of the larger Hidatsa tribe.

62
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:49,312
Centuries ago, they split off
on their own and wandered

63
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,566
or were pushed by conflict
with the Blackfeet, Cheyenne,

64
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,088
and Dakota until
settling here in

65
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:55,569
the Yellowstone River Valley.

66
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,279
That horse became
everything to our people.

67
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,575
Kennard Real Bird grew up
ranching and raising horses here

68
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:05,537
at Medicine Tail Coulee, which
happens to be the exact spot

69
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,084
where General George Custer had
the worst day of his life.

70
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,962
Kennard raises horses for rodeo...
Go!

71
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:17,007
For riding, and for
this... Indian relay racing.

72
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,301
The athletic ability on
them kids are just amazing.

73
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,596
The competition is intense.

74
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,515
They travel all over to compete
at this collarbone-smashing,

75
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:29,019
skull-cracking, bone-snappingly
dangerous sport...

76
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,939
Former allies and former
blood enemies alike.

77
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,314
It requires a lot of courage.

78
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,025
I'll bet.

79
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,485
And a high threshold for pain.

80
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,280
It's representative
of warrior mentality.

81
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,617
Welcome!

82
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,120
One rider, three horses.

83
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,245
They're all in line.

84
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,372
When they're lined
up, gun goes off.

85
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,333
It's like a spontaneous
combustion.

86
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,921
Away they go!

87
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,216
Top speed is around
40 miles an hour.

88
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,342
And after each lap,
the rider dismounts

89
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,763
at full freakin' gallop
and leaps, hopefully,

90
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,347
onto the next horse.

91
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,144
Yes, it's as dangerous and
difficult as it looks.

92
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,396
The prizes at big events run
into the thousands of dollars,

93
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,523
but, really, it's about
bragging rights...

94
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,279
And pride.

95
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,158
Being in motion, in
rhythm, in time, and in one

96
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,787
with that horse, you develop
strength of character.

97
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,081
And once they conquer that fear,

98
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,625
that feeling of
accomplishment is so great,

99
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,877
when they walk back
from that race,

100
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,257
they have this sense of pride,
and self-worth is sky-high.

101
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,592
Now they've identified
with their ancestors.

102
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:57,023
Ken's wife, Diane, has prepared
a lunch of buffalo steaks,

103
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,693
potato salad, fry bread,
and Indian pudding

104
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,570
made of Juneberry stewed
with flour and sugar.

105
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,866
When I looked at my ancestors,
they didn't have diabetes.

106
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,450
They didn't have much cancer.

107
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,329
They were very strong,
durable people.

108
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,497
And I said, "Well, I'm
gonna start eating"

109
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,042
nothing but buffalo."

110
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,751
Over the course of your life,

111
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,419
how much has this area changed?

112
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,462
Quite a bit.

113
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,507
We went and picked up a
four-wheeler last Sunday.

114
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,426
It'll be the first
four-wheeler on the place.

115
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,305
Given those changes,
what are the Crow people

116
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:31,058
gonna be doing in
20 years, 30 years?

117
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,468
The horse is gonna
play an important part

118
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,601
in the culture still?

119
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:37,231
I think so, yeah, because
what's a place gonna be like

120
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,440
without horses?

121
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,152
I wouldn't want to be there.

122
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,122
Who owns this land?

123
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,457
Can anyone really own it?

124
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,459
Who gets to use it?

125
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:03,382
These are big questions
that cut across traditional

126
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:05,842
ideological lines out here,
where they have real meaning,

127
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,262
not theoretical meaning.

128
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:13,641
All this belongs to one
man... this guy, Bill Galt.

129
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,874
Okay, we're about a half
mile from the confluence of

130
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,646
Rock Crick and the Smith River.

131
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:23,006
Galt Ranch is 100,000 acres
of grazing land, mountains,

132
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:24,903
cliffs, and valleys.

133
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,323
There's also some of the best
trout fishing on the planet.

134
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,491
Bill, the water level
on the crick looks good.

135
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,765
This is Bill's friend, the
author and journalist

136
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:33,954
David McCumber.

137
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,998
They disagree on land
use... a major issue.

138
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,043
Remember when you could do
that and still be friends?

139
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,298
Lee Kinsey is a
professional outfitter

140
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,342
who Bill leases some areas of
his property to for fishing.

141
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,344
- All this to outwit a fish.
- I know.

142
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,588
- It's amazing.
- All right. Go ahead.

143
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,888
Start that tip high.

144
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,515
Throw that thing
straight up in the air.

145
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,892
Good. Perfect.

146
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:59,375
Bill's a fifth-generation
Montanan whose principle business

147
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:00,563
is raising cattle.

148
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,065
He's no weekend cowboy.

149
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,524
This is work.

150
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,320
And he pays a lot of
attention to his land.

151
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,990
And a big issue for him...
For just about everybody

152
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:13,368
around here... is the
1985 Stream Access Law.

153
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:19,458
Anybody that could access
a stream via a public means

154
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,917
could, in fact, use the stream,

155
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,338
even if it was on private
ground as long as they stayed

156
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,215
within the ordinary high-water
mark of the stream.

157
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,490
Widely heralded by sportsmen
and outdoor enthusiasts,

158
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:33,554
the law did not go down well
with land owners like Bill.

159
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,576
Oh! Got him.

160
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:35,556
Something took a bite.

161
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,725
Yep. You still got a
fish right in there too.

162
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,685
Oh, I see him.

163
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:39,602
Perfect.

164
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,687
That's it!

165
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:41,729
Oh!

166
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,168
Fish of the day.

167
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,565
Nice brownie.

168
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,191
All right.

169
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:45,775
Whoo!

170
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,693
Beautiful thing.

171
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:47,568
That's pretty.

172
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,570
But I will not eat you
today, my friend.

173
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,739
Not today.

174
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,682
For lunch, a modest,
protein-centered repast of steak...

175
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:58,413
A wagyu-angus hybrid bred
and raised right here

176
00:08:58,414 --> 00:08:59,622
on Bill's ranch.

177
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,582
There's the marbling
on the wagyu steak.

178
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,584
That's what makes them good.

179
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,836
Oh, that's nice.

180
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,589
And it's pretty damn
tasty, I could tell you.

181
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,592
So you hold an opposing view,
is that correct, on access?

182
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,761
The idea behind the
Stream Access Law

183
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,223
that if you stay in
water, it's public...

184
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,598
I agree with that concept.

185
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,934
But where do you draw the line

186
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:20,227
for private-property rights?

187
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,749
If the state were to pass a law

188
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,293
that your restroom was public
because the public needed it,

189
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:25,982
in your house... - Right!

190
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,693
Oh, just because this isn't
my backyard doesn't mean

191
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,529
it's any less mine than
your toilet is yours.

192
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,198
We still pay taxes
on every foot of it.

193
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,116
I'm an old-school
lefty, but I got to say,

194
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,702
I kind of completely understand
the property owner's

195
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,702
point of view here.

196
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,620
There would be no
ambiguity in my feeling

197
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,874
if I inherited this land and
it had been in my family

198
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,168
for generations, and I
looked around at it and

199
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,629
wanted to keep it like it is...
If I were to go to a bar

200
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,216
in town and I would
ask, "How do you"

201
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,216
feel about this issue?"

202
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,044
- Where would it break?
- What would most people say?

203
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,837
It depends on if you're a
fisherman or a landowner.

204
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,637
Clearly divided right
down the middle.

205
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,466
Well, you know, a lot
of people are gonna say,

206
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,226
"When I was a kid, I used to
be able to go hunt and fish,

207
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,644
and I can't now, and stuff's
getting closed off."

208
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,313
I have some sympathy for that.

209
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,857
Anybody that's not
complying with Stream Access

210
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,651
merely has to step into the
stream when he hears you coming.

211
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,861
Right.

212
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,030
The spirit of it
is... it makes sense.

213
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,365
The spirit of it's thievery.

214
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,859
- Well...
- We own it, and they took it,

215
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,327
and that's not stealing
it, without compensation?

216
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,537
I think it's still here.

217
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,330
This is about being a
good neighbor, right?

218
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,457
Yeah.

219
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,771
I mean, so, if people ask
nicely, more often than not,

220
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:26,834
you're gonna say yes?

221
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,463
We do. It used to be,
before Stream Access,

222
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,757
we seldom required somebody to
have permission if they just

223
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:33,508
behaved themselves.

224
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,677
After Stream Access is
when the outfitters

225
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,973
came into the world, not because
we wanted to make money,

226
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,268
but we wanted somebody there
patrolling and policing it.

227
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,103
The outfitters take care of it.

228
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,307
A small stream like this can
only take so much pressure.

229
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,336
It really can.

230
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:50,691
And so we try to manage
it, fish it responsibly.

231
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,278
And if somebody wants to walk
all the way from the Smith

232
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,427
five miles up to here,
and do it legally, I say

233
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:57,698
all the more power to them.

234
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,700
That's what I'm saying.

235
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,331
♪ ♪

236
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,239
At first look, you'd
think this is

237
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,639
the worst place on Earth...
A ravaged, toxic,

238
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,933
godforsaken hill
threatened from above,

239
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,102
riddled with darkness below.

240
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,729
But you'd be wrong.

241
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,733
Butte, Montana... it is,
in fact, heartbreakingly,

242
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,528
poignantly beautiful.

243
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,302
The gallus frames seem
eyesores for only a second

244
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:41,180
before it becomes clear
why they are points

245
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:44,266
of fierce pride for locals,
for whom they signify

246
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:45,913
and commemorate everything.

247
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,957
For Montanans, many
people consider it

248
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,459
sort of a black eye.

249
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:53,129
I happen to think it's sort
of the essence of Montana.

250
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,922
Aaron Parrett was born in Butte.

251
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,591
He's a professor of literature

252
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,553
and a chronicler of the city's
colorful literary history.

253
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,222
There is something beautiful
about this city, right?

254
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,514
Yeah.

255
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,765
The enduring decay.

256
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,061
Like in Detroit or
Buffalo or Cleveland,

257
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:12,440
you can see the aspirations
of the builders or the people

258
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,774
who they were building for.

259
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,478
As I've gotten older, I
kind of think about it

260
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,133
the way Europeans romanticize

261
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:20,781
those ruins in Greece and Rome.

262
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,493
I view it as
America's Acropolis.

263
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,208
In its heyday, Butte
produced tens of billions

264
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,795
of dollars worth of copper
that built, well, America,

265
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,466
that helped power the country,
defend it against Germany

266
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:38,508
and Japan.

267
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,012
Without this hill, no copper
wire, no electricity.

268
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,725
At the turn of the
century, Marcus Daly's

269
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:48,747
Amalgamated Company
consumed its competitors

270
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:50,729
and became Anaconda Copper.

271
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,607
By the '20s, the Company,
as it was referred to,

272
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,234
was one of the largest
corporations in America,

273
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:00,050
generating staggering
wealth by today's

274
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:01,822
or any day's standards.

275
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,824
People came from
all over the world

276
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,161
to make their fortunes here
or simply for steady work,

277
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,829
a better life.

278
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,998
Cornish, Welsh, a lot
of Eastern Europeans...

279
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,835
Croatians, Serbs...
very ethnically diverse.

280
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,630
By Montana standards
or by any standard?

281
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,425
I would say by any
standards, that it's kind of a

282
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,425
micro-version of New York City.

283
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,719
Meaderville was an
Italian neighborhood

284
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,845
and developed a tradition
of supper clubs.

285
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,766
Lydia's was opened in 1946
by Lydia Mitchell Eddy

286
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,019
in the 4 Mile, the
valley below Butte.

287
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,854
So what is a supper club?

288
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,891
- I've heard about this tradition,
- but I don't really understand

289
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,858
What distinguishes a supper
club from a restaurant.

290
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,799
At least in Montana, the
supper clubs are a variation

291
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,862
on Meaderville style.

292
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:46,451
It involves this antipasto beginning...
Sliced beets,

293
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:49,870
sweet-potato salad, salami
and cheese, side salad,

294
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,872
pickled peppers,
and breadsticks.

295
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,667
Then when you actually
get your entrée,

296
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,878
you get, oddly enough, ravioli
or spaghetti or, here, both.

297
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,172
But also French fries.

298
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,465
Odd.

299
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:01,716
That may be unique to Montana.

300
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,303
For entrées, seared scallops
in white wine sauce for Aaron.

301
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,055
Me... noticing we're pretty
much landlocked around here...

302
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,517
I go for the extra-thick
tenderloin of beef,

303
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,518
thank you very much.

304
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,644
This is wacky.

305
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:13,728
It makes no sense.

306
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,939
It is somewhat bizarre to
have scallops and French fries.

307
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,940
Yeah.

308
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,400
Meaderville no longer around?

309
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,422
No, it's not.

310
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:22,987
It was swallowed up by the
Pit in the early '60s.

311
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,115
For the first 70 years,
it was hard-rock mining...

312
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,909
Blasting and digging tunnels
deep into the ground.

313
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,932
By the 1950s, mining was moving

314
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:34,123
increasingly to above
ground... open pit...

315
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,313
Which meant fewer
jobs and a bigger,

316
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:37,293
more visible footprint.

317
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:42,382
By 1955, the Berkeley Pit had
become the largest open-pit

318
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,300
copper mine in the world.

319
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,927
As it expanded, it
devoured Meaderville

320
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,304
and surrounding neighborhoods.

321
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,931
There was money down there
to be dug out of the ground,

322
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,933
and that's what Butte
had always been about

323
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,435
from the beginning.

324
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,980
In 1983, the pumps that
held back the groundwater

325
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,859
from thousands of miles of
tunnels beneath the city

326
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,319
were turned off.

327
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:07,866
The Pit filled with 30
billion gallons of water.

328
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,117
And as mine tailings
and mineral refuse

329
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,559
contaminated the water,
it became a giant,

330
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,959
insanely toxic lake of sulfuric
acid... a monument to greed

331
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,961
and heedless exploitation
of the Earth

332
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,632
and something eerily, if
tragically, beautiful.

333
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,385
If you're still living
here, you've got to have

334
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,346
some kind of weird,
perverse pride in the Pit.

335
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:30,263
Absolutely.

336
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,806
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.

337
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,140
No, you nailed it.

338
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,394
Obviously, the Pit is an enduring
emblem of that rapacious,

339
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,980
capitalist greed, but you
also have people here

340
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:41,232
who are proud of
where they live.

341
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,444
The history of Butte, in
many ways, is, you know,

342
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:47,405
this town that should've
died but never did.

343
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,199
Part of that is luck,
geographically,

344
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,410
but also the character
of the people here.

345
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,994
You know, they endured.

346
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,041
As you might have
gathered by now,

347
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,545
this is a working-class
town and unusual,

348
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:06,341
in that it's a union town,
a proudly union town,

349
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,635
in an otherwise very red state.

350
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,431
Butte is the most interesting,
important town in America

351
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,225
that nobody knows about.

352
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,228
Brian McGregor is the owner
of the Silver Dollar Saloon

353
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,731
in what was once
Butte's Chinatown.

354
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,608
So we call ourselves
Butte, America.

355
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,443
Amanda Curtis, a former state
congresswoman, was born

356
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,028
of the labor movement.

357
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,406
She's a unionist and
advocate for workers

358
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,493
in this solidly union
city she calls home.

359
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,537
When you got off the
boat in Ellis Island,

360
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,768
it said "Butte"

361
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:38,957
pinned to your shirt.

362
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,959
And it wasn't Butte,
Montana, right?

363
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,418
It was Butte, America.

364
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,463
We were founded by
European immigrants

365
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,278
who came from socialist countries
with all of these crazy

366
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,467
socialist ideas.

367
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,303
Would you say Montana,
in a stereotypic way,

368
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,054
is relatively socially
conservative?

369
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,786
Oh, absolutely.

370
00:16:55,787 --> 00:16:57,475
But Butte is a labor town.

371
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,096
Nobody knows anything about
union history, you know?

372
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,355
They don't teach it.

373
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,183
When the country was at its peak,
unions were at their peak.

374
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,901
When wages were at their peak,
unions were at their peak.

375
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,110
- That was then.
- This is now.

376
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,237
This is the era of
"I got mine, Jack."

377
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,656
That's what makes
Butte different.

378
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,115
It's not a "I've got mine."

379
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,221
It isn't. Why?

380
00:17:14,222 --> 00:17:15,284
It's truly not.

381
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,871
Unionists together, we've
grown this community

382
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,143
out of taking care
of each other.

383
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,541
You have to remember
what it was like here

384
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:25,085
for workers before unions,
if you can imagine.

385
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,089
Men worked underground for
as little as $3 a day,

386
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,092
10-to 12-hour shifts,
6 days a week.

387
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,993
Thousands died over the years
in industrial accidents

388
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:38,891
or from silicosis, lungs ravaged

389
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,267
by the airborne silica dust.

390
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,187
You don't have any
rights in your workplace

391
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,273
unless you bond together and
have a collective voice.

392
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,631
In a one-company town,
despite hiring assassins

393
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:52,739
and strikebreakers, Butte's
thousands of workers

394
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,115
successfully managed
to unionize.

395
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:59,119
Labor costs increased while
copper prices slumped.

396
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,581
Anaconda responded by
moving their production

397
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,897
increasingly south,
way south, to Chile,

398
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:07,461
where such impediments as
labor laws and fair wages

399
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,129
were more malleable.

400
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:14,260
We serve as the example about
what happens if you allow

401
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,554
unfettered capitalism.

402
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,305
But isn't there
something beautiful

403
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,557
about unfettered capitalism?

404
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,747
Because, look, this structure...
Oh, yeah.

405
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:25,104
We powered the entire world
As long as they're making

406
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,942
their money in the goddamn
United States of America first.

407
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:29,964
Right.

408
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:30,944
I feel I'm a patriot.

409
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,779
But if you're taking
jobs away from America

410
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,176
to export them overseas...
You're not.

411
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:36,156
You're not.

412
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,077
And we've been talking
about this for decades

413
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,077
in this country, right?

414
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,955
Keep our jobs here.

415
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,207
Yeah.

416
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,179
Time sinks slowly to the
deepest part of the ocean...

417
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,391
The Mariana Trench.

418
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:09,189
She's tired of light, and
there it's pure black.

419
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,359
They say that Butte is a
mile high and a mile deep,

420
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,361
and to get an idea
of what they mean,

421
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,574
you've got to go down...
Down deep into the hill.

422
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:22,036
An intricate warren of tunnels
riddled through the rock

423
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,935
and soil that lay beneath the
city was flooded forever

424
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:26,373
by water and darkness.

425
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,981
The Orphan Boy Mine is
one of the few remaining

426
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:31,712
hard-rock mines in the city.

427
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,156
Today it serves as a training
facility for the Montana Tech

428
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:40,054
School of Mines & Engineering.

429
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,933
There's five generations
of mining here.

430
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,812
In order to survive and provide
the resources for America,

431
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,272
these people were
super skillful.

432
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,233
Jim Keane is a state
senator and labor advocate

433
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,235
who grew up working
the mines of Butte.

434
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,947
How many miles of tunnel
under Butte, total?

435
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,240
10,000 miles of tunnels.

436
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,660
10,000 miles.

437
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,037
- And I figure...
- Like this?

438
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,371
Like this.

439
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,664
Only smaller, usually.

440
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,835
Larry Hoffman is a longtime
mining engineer and instructor.

441
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,670
Matt Krattinger is the new guy.

442
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,255
A hard-rock miner by
day, he likes to relax

443
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,258
by spending his free
time down here, playing.

444
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,670
I come mining for
fun on my days off.

445
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,095
Okay.

446
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,589
It's one of those things
that just gets in your blood.

00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,848
You got a lot of pride in it.

448
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,266
These guys like it underground.

449
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,268
And even more, they seem
to like drilling holes

450
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,854

451
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,321
You want to drill?

452
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,322

the miner was at the top

of the food chain.

00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,527
When I grew up,
he was considered

464
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,614
just like a doctor or a lawyer,
because everybody knew

465
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,783
he was the one making
everything work.

466
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,326
The other thing about mining
is it's so intensive.

467
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,411
I mean, you need engineers.

468
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,935
You need guys running ventilation...
Mechanic or a carpenter

469
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,332
or a pipe fitter.

470
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,440
It's just such a diverse
asset to have all these

471
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,503
different types of people.

472
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,964
That's what was
so good about it.

473
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,340
Mining was always dangerous.

474
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,261
But these men are
proud of what they do

475
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,554
and of the generations
who came before them,

476
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,182
who built neighborhoods
and schools

477
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,059
and helped power the nation.

478
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,352
They loved their work.

479
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,603
They raised their families.

480
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,147
They worked all the time.

481
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,963
It was a destination with
hopes and dreams of hard work

482
00:21:57,964 --> 00:21:59,026
leading to a better life.

483
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,778
You know, the Company's
a son of a bitch.

484

Let's face it. But they
were our son of a bitch.

So, you know, that's
just the way it was.

The community worked
to support the people.

487

Here's the fun part.

488
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:20,380
Cool.

489
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,383
Well, how many holes do you
usually drill to make a round?

490
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,802
Oh, between 20 and 30.

491
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,179
What is a round?

492
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,388
This pattern has
to be drilled out.

493
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,391
And every time you advance
the face, that is a round.

494
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,539
You drill it. You load it.

495
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,644
You blast it.

496
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,041
You muck it. You bolt it.

497
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:36,396
You drill it again.

498
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,899
And that's a cycle.

499
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,401
We're in the loading
process right here.

500
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,071
They call it collar priming
or top priming this hole.

501
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:44,843
Pull it.

00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:45,572
Still away.

Back in the day,
it was dynamite.

504
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,410
But in the '60s, they started
switching over to this stuff...

505
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,622
ANFO, ammonium nitrate
and fuel oil.

506
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,874
Okay.

charged up, loaded.

Now we get to time it.

509

This is kind of where I
got hooked on mining.

first round off, it was,

"How do we do another one?"

527
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:45,716
Oh, yeah.

528
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:46,466
Very cool.

529
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,302
Can we see the smoke?

530
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,929
Oh, does that vent it out?

531
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,639
Yeah. The smoke will
start moving towards us.

532
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,350
You got to get in the smoke.

533
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:55,935
Aw, yeah.

534
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,477
Smells like victory.

535
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,855
This is the smell of mining.

536
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,732
We'll see if it all
worked as planned.

537
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,192
That shock wave is awesome.

538
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:03,985
Isn't it?

539
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:04,735
Yeah.

540
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,487
This is like being an
astronaut right now.

541
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,719
You're gonna go in there,
and you're gonna be

542
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,161
the first person in the world
to see what you're seeing.

543
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,413
All right!

544
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,123
Did you break it?

545
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,707
Yeah!

546
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:21,648
Nice, huh?

547
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:22,502
Happy with your work?

548
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,422
I'm very happy with it.

549
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,506
Everything came out
just the way it should.

550
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,509
That's another six-foot advance.

551
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,095
And that is a round.

552
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:31,950
Beautiful thing.

553
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:32,763
Yes, it is.

554
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,187
I fell in love with the dark
and the blowing things up

555
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:40,229
and the people.

556
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,730
The people's a big thing.

557
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,358
You meet some of the
most interesting people.

558
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,411
About one third of
Montana is public land.

559
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,851
It was set aside for the
people of the United States

560
00:24:57,852 --> 00:24:58,705
of America.

561
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:03,210
Generally speaking, it is
intended for multipurpose use...

562
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:07,068
Timber harvest, grazing land,
hiking, fishing, hunting,

563
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:08,548
and mining.

564
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,073
These open lands are important
to hunters and anglers

565
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:13,553
like Dan Bailey.

566
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,807
He's the Montana representative
for Pheasants Forever...

567
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,559
An organization working
to conserve pheasants

568
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,188
and other wildlife through
careful management.

569
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,606
So this is a piece of
property that's owned

570
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,606
by Pheasants Forever.

571
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,192
It's open to public access.

572
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,277
This is through Montana's
Block Management system.

573
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,362
We sign in.

574
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:30,404
They collect all the tags.

575
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,648
They know who's on the property.

576
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,096
Today me and my friend Joe
Rogan are going after some

577
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:36,576
delicious pheasant for dinner.

578
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,454
Yee-haw, ladies and gentlemen.

579
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,622
Joe is, of course, is
the voice of the UFC

580
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,625
and the host of the
wildly popular podcast,

581
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,585
"The Joe Rogan Experience."

582
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,587
In recent years, Joe
has become an advocate

583
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,007
for the notion that you
should, whenever possible,

584
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,092
know where your food comes from.

585
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,886
The connection that
you have with your food

586
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,305
when you kill it yourself...
It's a totally different

587
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,515
experience.

588
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,497
I believe that if you choose
to eat meat, there should be

589
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:02,520
a little bit of guilt
and shame involved.

590
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,416
Something did die.

591
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:06,023
So there should be a sense of
loss and an understanding.

592
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,316
Right here, this is it.

593
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:08,810
I mean, you know where
your food comes from.

594
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,861
That's as small a
circle as you can get.

595
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,533
Hey, Tony, the three
things we can hunt here

596
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:19,245
are Hungarian partridge,
which is a small bird...

597
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,499
sharp-tailed grouse, and
then rooster pheasants.

598
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,730
So no hen pheasants.

599
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:25,918
I'll call out what it is.

600
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,627
Yeah, I'm gonna wait for you,

601
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,297
'cause I sure as hell wouldn't
be able to identify them.

602
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,833
So we'll get one person
on one side of the draw.

603
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,259
Need one person on the other.

604
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,669
And I'll run the dogs
through the middle.

break, do you think?

606

- Any way.
- It could be any way.

607

sautéed with garlic and brandy,

Why should people in New
York or San Francisco

683
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,714
who've never hunted... in
what way does your access

684
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:19,883
to hunting ground impact on
his nation in a positive way?

685
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:20,967
Why should they care?

686
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,240
Well, it's not hunting ground.

687
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,722
It's public ground owned by the
people of the United States

688
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:25,431
of America.

689
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,808
And I just see our
country... it's very nuanced.

690
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,644
And private property is bedrock.

691
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,312
But public lands have worked.

692
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,441
But you're talking big
government stepping in and saying,

693
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,131
"We're taking all this land,
"and we're gonna protect it

694
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:41,321
from exploitation by...
capitalists."

695
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,324
Public land management is
not perfect for anybody,

696
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,825
but it's a path forward.

697
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,362
It's not happening anywhere
else in the world.

698
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,476
And the reason that it came
here is because we are

699
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:51,582
such a great country, but
as we move into the future,

700
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,293
it's gonna take everybody
understanding how unique it is

701
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,628
to America.

702
00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:00,549
To say that hunting and
conservation are intertwined...

703
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:01,925
Is an absolute fact.

704
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,741
It is an absolute fact,
but it is a really painful

705
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:07,889
admission that we are the
masters of this environment,

706
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,558
whether we like it or not.

707
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,770
As thinking beings, we're the
only ones in the food chain

708
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,773
that understand the
consequences of the imbalance.

709
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,775
And, therefore, we
do have a right

710
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,311
to take care of this
thing and manage it.

711
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,945
When it comes to animals that
can alter their environment,

712
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,155
we're unique.

713
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,283
You know, I'm not a
hunter, obviously...

714
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,785
We hunted all day today.

715
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,211
If you take a shit,
you're a shitter.

716
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,165
My daddy didn't take
me for the long one.

717
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,899
- It is what it is.
- You shot that pheasant.

718
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,376
We're eating that pheasant.

719
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,630
There's no closer connection
to food almost than that.

720
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,420
I think there's a
fundamental misunderstanding

721
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,950
by people that don't hunt or
people that call themselves

722
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:48,972
"animal activists"

723
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,391
that we don't love animals
as much as they do,

724
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,310
and that's just not true.

725
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,689
We do what we do because
we love Mother Nature

726
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,835
We love wildlife.

727
00:30:57,836 --> 00:30:58,940
We want people to enjoy it.

728
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,901
You know, the three of us...
We have decided to spend

729
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,404
what we do for a living
to protect wildlife

730
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,073
and to protect access and to
protect hunting heritage.

731
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,266
They're fellow living

732
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:13,580
in a very hardscrabble life.

733
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,915
They're howling right now
because they killed something,

734
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,334
whatever it is.

735
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,953
They're letting all the
other coyotes know,

736
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,838
and they're gonna
eat it right now,

737
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,923
and that is what they do.

738
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,176
You know, if you ever been
out on an open body of water

739
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:30,096
where you're just surrounded
by the ocean or the desert

740
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,829

Hey, right.
