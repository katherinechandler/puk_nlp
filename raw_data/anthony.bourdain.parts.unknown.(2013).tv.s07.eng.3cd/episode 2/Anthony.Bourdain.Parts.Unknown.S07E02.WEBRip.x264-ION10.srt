00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,118
He was in a gang or he
got killed in a drive-by

520
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,704

Hip-hop artist
extraordinaire Lupe Fiasco

522
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:59,712
grew up on the South and
West Sides of Chicago.

523
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,716
But inside, his home was
always an island of sanity,

524
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,719
a supportive,
creative environment.

525
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,376
Well, what was different
about your family?

526
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:13,017
My mother and my father
were very intelligent

527
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:18,605
and politically oriented and
active, so it... it... you know,

528
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,608
I got book smart and
street smart, you know?

she is, along with being

532
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:34,747
an extraordinarily good
cook, an extraordinary

a tightly knit community

So what age were you when
you came to Chicago?

541
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,974
I was, uh, 13.

542
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,060
The worst thing that my
family could have ever done

543
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,146
was left the South...
Was left Mississippi.

544
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,064
We should have stayed.

545
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,942
But this was the land of
opportun... here and Detroit and

546
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,942
the great cities of the North.

547
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,651
It was and they came
up, you know, then...

548
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,154
We were never hungry
down in Mississippi.

549
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,490
We got here, depending
on welfare, whatever,

550
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,473
and they became alcoholics,
abusive to the children

551
00:24:13,474 --> 00:24:16,496
and wives, and the children
came out in the streets,

552
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:20,209
and just everybody lost
control, and now it's...

553
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:24,088
What was Chicago
like when you arrived?

554
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,799
Uh, it wasn't as violent.

555
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,969
You know, the neighborhoods
were communities.

556
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,512
No vacant lots, there
were families all over,

557
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,806
kids in the street.

558
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,475
You could go outside
and play and not worry

559
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,393
about your children.

560
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:43,232
And somewhere in the
late '70s, early '80s,

561
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:46,319
it started to change and
become more violent.

Chicago, want to celebrate

its character,

there's no getting away

571
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:08,590
from the ugly fact that
Chicago's South Side

572
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,759
is also currently the
murder capitol of America.

573
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,379
Why do you think people
are killing each other

574
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,847
in such large numbers in
Chicago and not in New York?

575
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,974
Let's be clear, it's
only a few spots.

576
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,593
- It isn't the whole city.
- It isn't the whole city.

00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,560
- It's not the whole city.
- It's not "Chi-Raq."

578
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,083
To be honest, "Chi-Raq"

579
00:25:22,084 --> 00:25:23,563
is Englewood.

580
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,857
Right.

Look, it's a pretty
staggering body count.

The sad part is that it's
been like this, right,

583
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,823
and the only reason it's a story
now is 'cause white people

584
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:34,574

"Aw, that's terrible."

589
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:45,878
Does a hip-hop artist have
an ob... any obligation really

590
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,509
to speak about anything positive
or even smarter than cars,

591
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,303
girls, or "Where's my money"?

592
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:58,807
Um... I guess it depends
on where you come from,

593
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:02,061
and then do you feel a obligation
to where you came from?

594
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,847
A lot of people in the 'hood
won't take me serious.

595
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,670
You know, they don't take Chuck
D serious, because at least

596
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:09,777
you take somebody who's
rapping about crack

597
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,071
and rapping about dope,
that is a actual thing that

598
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:14,177
they can go get and sell
and make money that day

599

You can't preach to them Black
Panther Party or you know,

they can't go out and get it

00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,666
and actually sell it
and monetize and make

603

where you have to redefine
what beauty is to you.

You go to different neighborhoods

00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,957
And you are not living in I.A.

689
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:37,877
or New York or living on a
mountaintop, peeing on the...

690
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,797
You know, peeing downwards
from a great height.

691

What are you, some
kind of a communist?

692
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,882
What's... what's the deal?

693
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,385
Well, I mean, I have
a healthy suspicion

694
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,554
of capitalism as a method.

695
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,890
I feel like, you know,
left unchecked,

696
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:56,062
capitalism is a kind of
cultural sociopathy.

697
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,899
Like, for a business to be
successful in capitalist terms,

698
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,445
it has to do the best possible
job of exploiting everyone

699
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:04,780
that it does interaction with.

700
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:05,864
Mm-hmm.

701
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,887
The endgame of capitalism
is that everything

702
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:09,681
is crappier and
crappier and people are

703
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:11,621
more and more
exploited, and I have

704
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:12,705
a healthy suspicion of that.

705
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:18,418
So I feel like the social model
that I'm comfortable with,

706
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,213
it suits my business practices,
which is that we're all

707
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,172
in the same game.

708
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,841

Mm, well, in my
circles it is, yeah.

In the punk rock scene and the
people who are influenced

714
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,938
by the punk rock scene,
that's a very common notion,

715
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,150
is that you're not trying
to extract the maximum,

716
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,362
you're trying to make sure
that everything goes...

00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,338
And I had to do in the
morning, so I'd just get up,

861
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,153
and Roger... he was
a very fat guy,

862
00:38:21,154 --> 00:38:24,761
always been a very fat guy
until, of course, he became ill,

863
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,554
but he was an
indefatigable walker.

864
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,722
He loved to walk.

865
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,539
And the reason we ended
up here was because

866
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,396
in the drinking society
that we were involved in

867
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:36,940
at the time, there
were not many walkers,

868
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:40,318
but Roger was a walker,
I was a walker.

869
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,947
Legendary film
critic Roger Ebert

870
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,033
was a man of mythic
proportions in Chicago.

871
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:50,411
A close friend of Bruce, half
of the Siskel and Ebert duo,

872
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,372
and a regular at the
Old Town Ale House,

873
00:38:53,414 --> 00:39:00,088
Roger passed away in 2013 after
a long battle with cancer.

874
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:04,050
I been sort of conducting
an informal poll

875
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,615
over the course of the
week, asking people

876
00:39:06,616 --> 00:39:07,804
who Chicago should honor.

877
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,139
If you had to put up a statue,

878
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,163
you know, of the... sort of
the... an iconic Chicagoan

879
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:15,478
who everybody agrees
is a good person,

880
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,649
and very popular
answer... Roger Ebert.

881
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,278
I would say that I'm a little
prejudiced, but definitely

882
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:27,448
Roger Ebert deserves all the
accolades he's been getting,

883
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,868
justifiably so.

884
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,911
Roger's the guy that got
me to write the blog,

885
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,831
and he's the guy that
gave me the tips.

886
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,501
He was an amazing guy,
and I think, of course,

887
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:44,465
had he not become ill and
really handled his illness

888
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,886
in a way that I could...
I can't even conceive

889
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:51,222
of myself handling, I
think that that really

890
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:54,372
kind of set him apart
from kind of the other

891
00:39:54,373 --> 00:39:56,019
iconic Chicago people.

892
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,729
The guy... and correct
me if I'm wrong...

893
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,023
This was an enthusiast,
I mean, this was a guy

894
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,317
who actually liked
going to the movies.

895
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,903
Now, this is not always
the case with critics.

896
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,031
They don't necessarily
love the people

897
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,658
or the subject matter
they're reviewing.

898
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,703
Roger loved movies
and he loved actors.

899
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,810
If you went over to his
house, he would want

900
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:16,706
to watch movies.

901
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,502
Siskel and Ebert, classic,
you know... it's like, that is

902
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:21,669
an iconic relationship.

903
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,171
They didn't seem to
like each other.

904
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,339
They hated each other.

905
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:25,499
- They hated each other?
- Yes.

906
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,717
I mean, they understood
what they had,

907
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,512
but a lot of people think
Siskel was the alpha.

908
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,472
Mm-hmm.

909
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:33,390
He was not.

910
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,683
Roger had two
things over Siskel.

911
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:39,145
He was a much better writer
and he was much better read.

912
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,357
So, Roger lived
principally in Chicago?

913
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,776
Oh, yes, and he had...
Believe me, he had plenty

914
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:45,777
of opportunities to leave.

915
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,135
I mean, he was offered some
serious dough to go to New York

916
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:51,074
and go to I.A.

917
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,491
Why didn't he go?

918
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:56,955
In Chicago, favors are worth
more than money and loyalty.

919
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,749
In Chicago, this is
very important stuff.

920
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,709
Roger is one of the
most loyal people.

921
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:05,171
He was loyal to his
friends, to his family.

922
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,172
Right.

923
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:10,176
And I just... I don't have
any problem understanding

924
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,345
why he decided to stay here.
