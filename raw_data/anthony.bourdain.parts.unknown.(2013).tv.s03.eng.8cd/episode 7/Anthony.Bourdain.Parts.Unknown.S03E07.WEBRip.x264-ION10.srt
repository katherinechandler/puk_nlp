awesome Thai food.

Pretty spicy?

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,976
Put that in there.

42
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,613
Andy has made a name for
himself faithfully reproducing

43
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,549
the cuisine of
northern Thailand.

44
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:10,550
The good stuff comes
from places like here.

45
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:16,896
Rice country.

46
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:23,636
Chiang Mai province.

47
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,638
In this part of the world, you

48
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:33,639
live and die by the harvest.

49
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,449
Thai food is intensely regional.

50
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,019
In northern Thailand in

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,054
particular, has many
distinctive features.

52
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,091
This is a world of fresh,

53
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:50,963
delicious, spicy, meaty,
salty, sour, sweet, bitter.

54
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:55,034
Often with a just-picked
herby dimension.

55
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,937
And always the most vital thing,

56
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:02,375
giver of life, sticky rice.

57
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,010
Andy here is constantly back and

58
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,446
forth from America to Thailand,

59
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,316
for nearly 25 years now, looking

60
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:12,819
for recipes, techniques, digging

61
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,955
deeper and deeper into an
amazingly complex and widely

62
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:23,195
misunderstood cuisine.

63
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,565
And getting his ass chastised by

64
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,300
a few aunties as he goes.

65
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:31,871
Okay.

66
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,141
On this trip, Andy's working on

67
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,377
a new book, investigating the

68
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:40,647
eating and drinking
culture of the region.

69
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,214
Which might be why he thought of

70
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,852
me and why we're drinking
shine for breakfast.

71
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:50,923
Where there's food, there's
also going to be booze.

72
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,058
And likely, a lot of it.

73
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:58,064
That's good.

74
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:01,534
We make chili paste with

75
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:06,739
chilies, garlic, shallot,
shrimp paste and tomatoes.

76
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:14,740
Then you mix it with pork.

77
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:15,282
Okay.

78
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:20,953
Oh, yeah.

79
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:21,221
Awesome.

80
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:25,091
Isn't it delicious?

81
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,460
This rice is grown
here in the village.

82
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,462
You just kind of make a little

83
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,263
spoon-shaped ball with it.

84
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,500
Now, what's the famous agreeing?

85
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,267
Is it have you eaten yet
or have you had rice?

86
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,302
It's both.

87
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,904
Literally it means have
you eaten rice yet.

88
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,473
What it literally means
is how's it going.

89
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,074
It is assumed that if you
haven't eaten yet, things are

90
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,910
not going well.

91
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,778
If you have eaten, rice is such

92
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,550
a fundamental component...
Eating is synonymous with

93
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,151
eating rice.

94
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:56,122
To eat a meal without rice
would be unthinkable.

95
00:05:56,123 --> 00:06:01,794
What makes their
whiskey special?

96
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,563
Because of the flavoring
that they add to it.

97
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,565
Conveniently, our hosts in

98
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,266
addition to having provided us

99
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,100
with a fine meal, just so happen

100
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,302
to run a distillery out back.

101
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,138
They use a spice mixture they

102
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,906
add to the yeast balls, let it

103
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,508
ferment for five days, then she

104
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,178
smashes it with a wood mallet.

105
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:24,350
Thai rice whiskey, bucket of

106
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,352
hootch, whatever you want to

107
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,287
call it, this tastes delightful

108
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,022
and smoother, apparently,
the more you drink.

109
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:35,294
There you go.

110
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:40,500
Well... and then fried fish.

111
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:48,501
I believe it's called Nile
tilapia or Nile carp.

112
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:54,714
Salt the hell out of
it and deep fry it.

113
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,849
Good stuff.

114
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:04,850
Mm.

115
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,028
Guy's trying to kill us.

116
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,262
Yeah.

117
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,966
Okay, okay.

118
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,735
For your uncle, yes.

119
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,203
69 years old.

120
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,038
He looks good.

121
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,206
He drinks half a bottle a day.

122
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,708
It's pretty much the Keith

123
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,175
Richards health and
preservation plan.

124
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:23,544
All right.

125
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:24,911
I want to get healthy, too.

126
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:30,216
The whiskey, I have to
say, is taking hold.

127
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:33,252
In some clinically
fascinating ways.

128
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:39,526
Funny.

129
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,027
I lost the plot.

130
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:47,066
Oh, that's okay.

131
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:55,067
It all comes back to me as
the world shifts and tilts.

132
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,913
Although I had been looking out

133
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,081
a lot of hotel windows these

134
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,517
days struggling to figure out

135
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,919

136
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,955
back shots of rice whiskey with

137
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:14,694
these guys, I know I'm
back in Thailand.

138
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,864

139
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,633
Not just Thailand, but
northern Thailand.

fertile, green and gorgeous

Burma, China, Laos,
India not too far away.

All of them have left
their Mark on the food.

Here's the local hooch.

If you're eating here,
chances are, you're also

149
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:54,066
drinking.

150
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:59,471
Compared to the stuff we
had this morning, this is

151
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,173
substantially more
harsh, I would say.

152
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:07,146
And less fragrant.

153
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:12,184
The village of may yon.

154
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,953
This place is called Hin tang.

155
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,121
How did you find this place?

156
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,488
We're in the middle of nowhere.

157
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,124
It's a very popular place.

158
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,491
A restaurant showcasing one

159
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,027
of the distinguishing elements

160
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,795
of northern Thai cuisine, the

161
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,431
heavy use of animal protein.

162
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,467
You see the local people,
they're lining up.

163
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:32,038
Here in northern Thailand,
pig reigns supreme.

164
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,174
Most of the stuff we're eating
here is made out of pig.

165
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:35,843
What did you order?

166
00:09:35,844 --> 00:09:39,311
Grilled pig tail.

167
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,047
That sounds superb.

168
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,515
Yep.

169
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,885
Then we ordered northern
Thai herbal pork sausage.

170
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,655
Oh, yeah, I'm on that.

171
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:48,922
Brain.

172
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:53,793
Some pig's brain.

173
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:54,027
Yeah.

174
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:57,864
I'm not a big brain fan.

175
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,566
A custardy sort of texture,

176
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,402
coupled with this
sort of nutty taste.

177
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,337
Frankly, I would sooner grab a

178
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:12,178
big handful of nut
sack, so to speak.

179
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,545
I-'mixed with a curry paste and

180
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,882
some herbs and stuff, thrown

181
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,217
into a banana leaf
and then grilled.

182
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,086
It's like eating scrambled eggs.

183
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:23,355
You'll love it.

184
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,057
Then we ordered raw blood soup.

185
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:25,558
Raw.

186
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,559
What do you mean,
they don't cook it?

187
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,394
They do not cook the blood.

188
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,029
They put it into a hot soup.

189
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,097
No.

190
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:31,531
This is raw blood.

191
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:37,704
Really.

192
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,072
There's two kinds that
you can get here.

193
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:46,445
One is the addition of young...

194
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,081
It's basically the partially

195
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:55,187
digested juice that's made
from when a cow eats grass.

196
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,089
Oh, geez.

197
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,358
Oh, no.

198
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,961
I did not order that.

199
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:02,730
We're not having that.

200
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,296
Okay.

201
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,097
We're not having that.

202
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,597
We're not having that.

203
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,966
I'm thinking we'll stick to

204
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,367
the plain blood soup,
thank you very much.

205
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,269
The way they make it is they

206
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,104
take the raw blood and they

207
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,406
scrunch it with lemon
grass for a long time.

208
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,275
Right.

209
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:17,476
Because that kind of kills

210
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,378
the gamey flavor of the blood,

211
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,613
helps with the coagulation
and adds flavor.

212
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:29,614
Then they actually
make chopped laarb.

213
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:30,991
That goes in.

214
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:35,295
Bunch of deep-fried innards.

215
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:47,073
Here it is.

216
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:50,309
You're not kidding.

217
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,812
That's like a horror movie.

218
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,480
Like "CSI" soup.

219
00:11:54,481 --> 00:12:01,287
I'm eating out of an open wound.

220
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,155
Actually, that's
completely delicious.

221
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:05,157
Utterly delicious.

222
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:10,830
That makes you look
like a vampire.

223
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,664
It's quite spicy.

224
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:12,965
You can taste the chili.

225
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,634
It doesn't really
taste like blood.

226
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,203
It just kind of tastes
sweet and rich.

227
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:21,774
Let's see if we can change
your mind about brains.

228
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:22,209
Delicious.

229
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,310
I'm not lying.

230
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,045
This is delicious.

231
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:26,178
Anyone would
completely love this.

232
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,347
You eat too much of
it, you'll go blind.

233
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:32,051
That's what they think.

234
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,453
It has to do with parasites
and all kinds of stuff.

235
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:34,955
Huh?

236
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:37,023
Can I tell you some stories.

237
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,657
Whoa, back up there.

238
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:38,926
Parasites?

239
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:43,629
Two or three years ago, a
whole family in nan province,

240
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,531
all seven of them died.

241
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,666
You probably should have told

242
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:51,503
me that during the
appetizer course, okay?

243
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,040
Honestly, best food I ever
had in Thailand, ever.

244
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,543
I'm super happy to hear that.

245
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:58,811
I would eat it out of a

246
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,479
jockstrap on a hot summer's day.

247
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,482
This is CNN.

248
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,717
Oh, god.

249
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:27,173
In Chiang Mai you can
move in and out.

250
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:31,743
From the quiet green of the

251
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,445
countryside to just a few miles

252
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,348
away, the madness and
chaos of Chiang Mai city.

253
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:42,354
Second largest in Thailand.

254
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,455
Spirituality, reflection, the

255
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:48,194
serene beauty of the rice
paddy, village life.

256
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:48,929
Maybe next episode.

257
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,764
This time, it's all about

258
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,433
consuming medically inadvisable

259
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,968
amounts of food and drink.

260
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,604
If Thailand is one of the best

261
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,108
countries to eat in, in Chiang

262
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,575
Mai it's a particularly good

263
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,612
city to find yourself hungry.

264
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,047
That's the frog.

265
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:10,116
That's the frog.

266
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:15,454
It's basically taking that frog,

267
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:19,258
grill him first, hack it up, fry

268
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,931
the living bollocks out
of it with garlic.

269
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:25,965
Mm.

270
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,267
There's almost an inverse
relationship, like the more

271
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,802
hideous looking the dish,
the more delicious it is.

272
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,138
As you probably noticed by

273
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,275
now, the food here is not pad

274
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:37,910
Thai or green curry chicken.

275
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,912
There are complex layers of

276
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:45,851
flavor, sophisticated balances,

277
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:53,852
spicy, sour, a little
bitter, salty, herby.

278
00:14:56,163 --> 00:15:00,366
Color and texture are important.

279
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:03,602
Crispy, soft, cold, hot.

280
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,205
It's exactly this interplay
between elements that makes

281
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:11,210
northern Thai food so
thrilling and so addictive.

282
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:18,350
This place is called
la gouchung cha.

283
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,618
What is that curry material?

284
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,221
That's one of the many
stomachs of the cow.

285
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:26,025
Might be the third stomach.

286
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:26,859
Mine's bitter.

287
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,062
Means it has a
little bit of bile.

288
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:38,063
The gentleman over there,
uncle, he's the laarb master.

289
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,807
He wins competitions.

290

The woman that just took
the order, her family, the

uncle's... when it gets really

292
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:57,216
busy, the rest of the
family comes and helps.

293
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,161
You famously said you
hate the word authentic.

294
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,063
What does that word mean?

295
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:04,730
Depends on the context.

296
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,333
If you're in the United States
and you say traditional

297
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,735
authentic Thai restaurant, to me

298
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,837
that has come to mean a standard

299
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:12,904
Thai restaurant in America.

300
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:13,506

301
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,007
When you come here,
authentic is different.

302

You're the daughter of the woman

303
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,743
who made this, then to you this

304
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,446
is the most authentic
version of that dish.

305
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,749
If you are from nan province,

306
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,218
you still make laarb but it
doesn't taste like this.

307
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:30,622
Little bit different.

308
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:38,623

You got beer, you got booze,
you got ice, you got some

367
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,159
grilled meat.

368
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,393
Snackage?

369
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,728
Yes, I would like snacks.

370
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:10,729
They've got pork
chin and intestines.

371
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:16,875
Got a spice dipping sauce.

372
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:24,876
Ah, this is a Chinese liquor.

373
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:26,686
Tastes like medicine.

374
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:27,520
Yes.

375
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:35,521
It also tastes
like a dirty sack.

376
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,866
When did you come
to Thailand first?

377
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,201
I believe it was 1987.

378
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,103
And I came as a backpacker.

379
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,938
It was all about smoking dope on

380
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,774
the beach, eating mushrooms,

381
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,376
chasing girls and drinking beer.

382
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,843
I had a three-month ticket and

383
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,379
ended up staying
away for four years.

384
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:59,017
Here we go.

385
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:03,188
Oh, man.

386
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,256
So what was the dish?

387
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,892
A dish in every traveler's life

388
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,727
where they just said okay, my

389
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:09,761
previous life is not going to be

390
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:10,962
enough for me anymore, you know?

391
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,931
There's a particular mushroom.

392
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:13,965
They make soup out of it.

393
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,435
It was unlike anything I
had ever had in my life.

394
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,769
When I first came out to this

395
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,740
part of the world, noodles.

396
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,809
I knew right then.

397
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,110
I'm not joking.

398
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,579
It wasn't the girls,
it wasn't the beaches.

399
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,549
The noodles, the greasy bottle

400
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:34,119
of fish sauce and the smell.

401
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,721
There's this terrible moment

402
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:36,755
where you realize I
can't share this.

403
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:43,228
That's it.

404
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,563
In about five seconds we will

405
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:51,003
go past a woman who
has a cowboy hat on.

406
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:58,477
The lady with the hat stands

407
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,812
out among the dozens of street

408
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,949
vendors across from the
old city's north gate.

409
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,351
The best stewed pork
leg in the city.

410
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,586
Potentially none
finer in Thailand.

411
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,121
Are we doing that?

412
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:16,862
For years, she has
been serving this.

413
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:17,697
Slowly stewed pork.

414
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:20,566
She cooks it in a master sauce.

415
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,568
It probably goes back
at least a generation.

416
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,003
Like Sherry, there's a little

417
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:28,674
bit of the original
batch still in there.

418
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:29,308
Exactly.

419
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,843
Hacking red meat all day and

420
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:35,781
there's like not a
drop on the frilly...

421
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,883
This is a sauce
that goes with it.

422
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,718
Kind of like a sour chili sauce.

423
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,453
You got to have some of these

424
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:45,457
pickled mustard Greens, too.

425
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,692
That's really tasty.

426
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:48,694
This place is famous as hell.

427
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:50,662
Half the people here are
tourists, probably Chinese

428
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:58,370
tourists.

429
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:09,173
Let's do it.

430
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,182
You want to stick your
feet in some fish water?

431
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:11,417
No.

432
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:14,920
No.

433
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,822
Let's go, guys.

434
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,657
I need to stop at a sports bar.

435
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:23,595
I need to have some chicken
wings and fried mozzarella

436
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:23,863
sticks.

437
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:28,233
I need to go to a gun range.

438
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:29,935
More beer, more food.

439
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,703
If you go on the sidewalk it

440
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,606
will take us like ten
minutes to get 50 feet.

441
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,208
Kind of stay to your right
and don't get killed.

442
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,445
What was I saying?

443
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,446
Oh, yes.

444
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:42,781
Beer loves crispy.

445
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:43,550
Beer loves salty.

446
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:48,186
Beer loves fatty.

447
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:48,387
Spicy.

448
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:48,588
Salty.

449
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,789
Fried, together?

450
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:57,462
Happiness.

451
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:01,466
No beer.

452
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,101
Okay.

453
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:03,368
What are they drinking?

454
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:08,540
They're drinking water.

455
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,075
Kidney cleaning water.

456
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:10,976
So good.

457
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:14,646
And so important to a
healthy lifestyle.

458
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:20,318
I would imagine.

459
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:20,787
Midnight.

460
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:21,987
That's what you do after you've

461
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:23,488
had a few drinks, meaning a lot

462
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,390
of drinks, because what you

463
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,491
need, maybe you didn't know you

464
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:31,563
needed it but you do,
is Thai chili dip.

465
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:32,664
Yeah.

466
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,299
It's what the vast majority of

469
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,404
and come back end up getting

470
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,339
busted at the airport
for trying to bring in.

471
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,174
We get two kinds.

472
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:46,678
A combination of chilis,
garlic, shrimp paste, dried

Crispy, meaty, salty.

should have listened.

Wait, where did we leave off?
