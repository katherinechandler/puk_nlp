00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,707
Everybody can press you and
destroy your business.

187
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,508
That's it.

188
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:09,842
This is a system.

189
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,878
Meet Boris Nemsaw.

190
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,248
He was deputy prime minister

191
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,317
under Yeltsin and today is one

192
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:23,555
of Putin's most vocal critics.

193
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,357
This restaurant was kind enough

194
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,193
to take us in but the chef is a

195
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,861
Brit so maybe he has
less reason to worry.

196
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,863
First course, gentlemen?

197
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,531
At Yornick restaurant they

198
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,701
are serving their own versions

199
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:40,372
of Dino-era Russian classics.

200
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:44,944
A modern riff on borscht,

201
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:45,578
typically a hearty cabbage broth

202
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,614
with meat, here's a puree with a

203
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:56,388
more elegant shall we say
deconstructed presentation.

204
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,691
Critics of the government,
critics of Putin, bad things

205
00:10:58,692 --> 00:10:59,192
seem to happen to them.

206
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:03,229
Yes.

207
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,530
Unfortunately, existing power

208
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,733
represent what I say Russia old

209
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,400
19th century, not of 21st.

210
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,404
Critics of Putin, beware.

211
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,275
Oligarch Kolikofsky accused

212
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,210
Putin of corruption and spent

213
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,779
ten years in prison
and labor camps.

214
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,083
Alexander Litvinenko accused
state security services of

215
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,385
organizing a coup to
put Putin in power.

216
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,154
He was poisoned by a lethal dose

217
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:36,155
of radioactive polonium and
Viktor Yushenko poisoned,

218
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,133
disfigured and nearly killed
by a toxic dose of dioxin.

219
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,802
I'm not saying official Russian

220
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,336
bodies had anything to do with

221
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,739
it but it's mighty suspicious.

222
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,941
I don't think you need to be a

223
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,610
conspiracy theorist to say
whoever did this very much

224
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,679
wanted everyone to
know who done it.

225
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,947
Everybody understands.

226
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:55,448
Of course.

227
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,116
Everybody is meant
to understand.

228
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,319
Everybody understands.

229
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,189
Everybody understands
everything in this country.

230
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,926
When you're talking classic
conspiracy theories and

231
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,294
classically Russian style

232
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,129
paranoia, you want some classic

233
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,966
Russian food to
go along with it.

234
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,134
Pelmini, minced meat dumplings

235
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:20,873
served on a pillow of
cabbage with sour cream.

236
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:21,141
Mh.

237
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:22,608
Very good.

238
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,510
Maybe the most extreme and

239
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:25,444
visible example of how things

240
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,947
seem to work here is
the Sochi Olympics.

241
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:31,550
If you look at the map of
Russian Federation, it's

242
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:38,958
difficult to find a sport
without knowing... but Putin

243
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,226
did.

244
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:42,294
It seems like a pretty obvious
question, if you wanted

245
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,196
to hold a winter Olympics in

246
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,564
Miami, presumably someone would

247
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,466
say isn't it a
little warm there.

248
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,502
This is absolutely
personal Putin project.

249
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,471
They spent more than $50 billion

250
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,507
of dollars, which is the most

251
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,843
expensive games of mankind.

252
00:12:56,844 --> 00:13:02,748
$26,000 a seat for
the curling stadium?

253
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,383
To build?

254
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,152
The road is 30 miles.

255
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,654
Price for that, $9 billion U.S.

256
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,722
This is a road, right?

257
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,892
It's three times expensive than

258
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,494
American program flying to Mars.

259
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,864
And who got many of those
contracts for the roads and

260
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,366
stadiums and infrastructure?

261
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,102
Well, there's these guys.

262
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,736
Putin's childhood friends and

263
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:28,040
judo partners, the Rottenburg
brothers, whose companies

264
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,943
received contracts worth
upwards of $7 billion.

265
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,079
And Putin's associate of 20

266
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,582
years, Vladimir Yakunin, who
owns the state railroads.

267
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:40,086
His company received $10
billion worth of contracts.

268
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,288
It's very easy to imagine

269
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,555
what's happened with this money.

270
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,124
Right.

271
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,557
You know who cares in Russia?

272
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:50,562
Just about no one.

273
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,233
This is a case of
the Binenko case.

274
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,801
A known enemy of Putin stricken

275
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:59,638
with a bout of
radioactive polonium.

276
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,107
Aren't you concerned?

277
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:01,140
Me, about myself?

278
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:01,808
Yeah.

279
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:04,743
You're a pain in the ass.

280
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,146
Tony, I was born
here 54 years ago.

281
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,215
This is my country.

282
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,084
The Russian people
are in trouble.

283
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,921
Russian court doesn't work.

284
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,122
Russian education
decline every year.

285
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:20,659
I believe that Russia has
a chance to be free.

286
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,428
Has a chance.

287
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:25,365
It's difficult but
we must do it.

288
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,667
America, yeah.

289
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:03,702
All of Russia's
eyes are upon you.

290
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:07,940
Bring honor to your... you
know what, America, I

291
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:08,308
will break you.

292
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:16,309
I will break you.

293
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,291
Forget about it.

294
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:32,292
I'll bury you.

295
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:42,134
I'll rip up your visa!

296
00:15:55,155 --> 00:16:03,155
No!

297
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,332
O'er the land of the free.

298
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,333
Just missed it, buddy.

299
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,535
That was pretty close.

300
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:13,505
I was actually out here all
last night practicing.

301
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:20,212
I'm kidding.

302
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,048
While Zamir contemplates a

303
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:22,749
suddenly grimmer future thanks

304
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,218
to me, I head out to Rublevka, a

305
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,087
compound of luxury homes outside

306
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:35,861
Moscow, to meet
Alexander Levedu.

307
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,698
At one time, Alexander
was doing great.

308
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,267
Former officer of the
intelligence services like

309
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,769
Putin, turned billionaire.

310
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,705
He owned pieces of Russia's most

311
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,274
powerful energy companies,

312
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:52,544
airlines and banks, and still
publishes one of the only

313
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:56,915
opposition newspapers
left in Russia.

314
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,217
But running a newspaper that's

315
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,487
been harshly critical of
the ruler has cost him.

316
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,456
He's been stripped of
nearly everything.

317
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,425
It can be a dangerous thing to

318
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,395
do investigative journalism
in this country.

319
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:13,232
Your own paper, five
journalists, six lost their

320
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:13,433
lives?

321
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:13,733
Yeah.

322
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,301
Probably the biggest number

323
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,669
because there was no war in this

324
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,970
country, so in peaceful times,

325
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,473
to lose six journalists
killed is quite a lot.

326
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,243
Six journalists
murdered, one paper.

327
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,677
Presumably for their reporting

328
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:29,448
on political corruption
or human rights abuse.

329
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:33,152
Though pointing a finger
directly at the government is

330
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,486
impossible, one can say that the

331
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,422
climate here is such that what

332
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:41,327
you say can certainly
get you killed.

333
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,528
You have at various stages made

334
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:43,629
life difficult for yourself.

335
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,497
Business was very good for you,

336
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,765
then you had to have an opinion.

337
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,500
When you interact with the

338
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,469
local bureaucracies and judicial

339
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,537
system, it still leaves a lot to

340
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,772
be desired, let's
put it this way.

341
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,108
Levedev is now a potato farmer.

342
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,043
That's my production.

343
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:57,844
That's my potato.

344
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:01,813
The biggest producer in Russia,
true, but his billions

345
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,549
are gone.

346
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,117
He now lives the life
of a mere millionaire.

347
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,685
Let's see how you like this one.

348
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,520
Very good.

349
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:08,954
Some freshly made potato chips

350
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:13,892
that Levedev is very proud of.

351
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,494
And his personal chef prepares

352
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,028
Scottish salmon, smoked on

353
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:22,334
cherry tree sawdust
served with avocado.

354
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,502
Mm.

355
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:23,702
Very good.

356
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,405
Lately, he is getting
into slow food.

357
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:30,676
This is cold pressed
cedar tree in Siberia.

358
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,345
Cedar oil?

359
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,580
But he has not slowed down his

360
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,583
profile or kept his mouth shut.

361
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:38,884
Recently, in a Russian talk

362
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,086
show, he got in an argument over

363
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,089
the financial crisis with
another guest, a heated

364
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,391
argument.

365
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:46,725
He ended up smacking the guy.

366
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,560
I saw the incident on television

367
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,728
that got you in trouble.

368
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,232
I found it very refreshing,
actually, something that

369
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,900
political discourse
could use more of.

370
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,936
The government took the
opportunity to charge him with

371
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:02,208
politically motivated
hooliganism, a charge that could

372
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,843
have resulted in a penalty
of five years in prison.

373
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,246
He is instead been
convicted of battery.

374
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,114
He is working off his sentence

375
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:12,083
painting fences and
shoveling snow.

376
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,420
I mean, sitting on a bench

377
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,721
and expecting to spend the next

378
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:16,922
five years in prison with two

379
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,691

380

said something very bad.

383
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,901
Though his victim did not

384
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,737
register an official complaint,

385
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,939
the message I think was clear.

386
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,441
The charges were pressed by

387
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,608

388
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:37,943

private accusation.

dangerous, to criticize or

00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:40,171
supposed to be just fine, that

407
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:47,212

It's very nice, we have

work as it should.

413
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:11,870
So that prevents right now
in Russia to speak freely.

414
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,872
Formerly nothing but in
reality, a lot of things.

415
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:18,209
Let's talk about MTV.

416
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,078
Rebel music as I understand it

417
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,713
was an MTV music series whose

418
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:25,984
fundamental principle was
to celebrate bands who say

419
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:29,421
difficult things in environments
where there might be

420
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:29,756
repercussions.

421
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:32,391
And as I understand it, your

422
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,093
band was chosen for one
of seven episodes.

423
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:35,395
Correct.

424
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:38,864
And in fact, one of your
songs was used as the title

425
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,600
track for the series.

426
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:44,736
So I get a letter from the

427
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,438
producer and essentially it says

428
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,939
because of political pressure,

429
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,241
the Russia episode has been

430
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,077
removed from the
rebel music series.

431
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:54,112
According to the producer,

432
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,082
MTV Russia pushed back on the

433
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,083
content, she presumes because of

434
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,217
the negative impact it would

435
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,919
have on them and their ability

436
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,556
to do business on a
day-to-day basis in Russia.

437
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,591
MTV's official reason for

438
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,726
removing Luna from the series is

439
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,194
that they simply did not have

440
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,897
enough time to air all
the stories they filmed.

441
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,265
This was a documentary series

442
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,967
about musicians standing up and

443
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,937
risking their lives in some
cases to stand up against

444
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,072
government abuse of power,

445
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,442
government corruption, and yet,

446
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:26,812
a foreign government was able to

447
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:27,414
editorially control what

448
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:29,648
American viewers see
on their TV screens.

449
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:32,418
That to me is a scandal
of epic proportion.

450
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,386
This entire documentary's gone.

451
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:38,657
Luna's song is the title track
to the series, but their

452
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,959
episode never happened.

453
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,631

00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,870
Everybody came charging
through, charged up the steps

550
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:58,143
and looted the palace.

551
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:02,447
And he had to put on his
female outfit to escape the

552
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,448
revolutionary peasants.

553
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:04,950
That wouldn't go over
well these days.

554
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:05,484
Not anymore.

555
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:07,986
Recently in the run-up to the

556
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:08,721
Sochi Olympics, attention has

557
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:12,791
been drawn to a wave of rabidly

558
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,459
homophobic remarks
by public officials.

559
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,895
Images of gay and lesbian
activists being beaten and

560
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:17,896
harassed in the street, often

561
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:20,665
with official or
semi-official consent.

562
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,401
And a new law which claims to

563
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:27,405
forbid promoting homosexual

564
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:28,606
propaganda to minors but which

565
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:34,345
could be interpreted any way
the authorities choose.

566
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:34,814
What's happening here?

567
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:39,417
What's going on?

568
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:40,086
Oh, my god.

569
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:42,420
I don't know what's going on.

570
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,422
Every day, I ask myself what's

571
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,757
going on, what's going on.

572
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:46,358
Do you have to be afraid?

573
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,159
No.

574
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,797
I have nothing to lose.

575
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:56,935
So I can be myself.

576
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:59,270
I'm nobody in social system.

577
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:03,108
Artist and film maker Xena

578
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,876
Robrek is a brave young woman.

579
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:06,611
She's openly gay.

580
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:07,712
Lately, the actual hunting of

581
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,881
gay people has been documented.

582
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:13,451
Violent skinhead gangs who
contact gay men and women

583
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,286
online, arrange meetings under

584
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:17,789
false pretenses, then
violently ambush them.

585
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:24,395
There have been very
few prosecutions.

586
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,831
You can get killed for this.

587
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:31,169
Our local fixer, Dasha,
helps translate.

588
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,004
She had a situation once

589
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:37,375
where the skinheads
attacked her on the street.

590
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:38,576
Not only once.

591
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:41,512
This new law prohibits
propaganda?

592
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:47,486
Amongst minors.

593
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,860
Soviet propaganda, you can
go to jail for anything.

594
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:55,894
It means whatever
they want it to mean.

595
00:29:55,895 --> 00:30:00,065
Yes.

596
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,499
How many gay families we have

597
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,202
with kids, and those people are

598
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:06,571
in maximum stress right now

599
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:10,341
because their families
might be hooligans.

600
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:13,144
We rightly see this
as outrageous.

601
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,212
The Russian public, however,

602
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,914
it's very likely a vote getter.

603
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:21,853
A cynical pandering to a
powerful and enduring vein of

604
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:26,124
deep-seated homophobia
that goes way, way back.

605
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:31,296
What do you think the
source of this hatred is?

606
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,865
It's not about Russian church.

607
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:34,966
It's about political structure.

608
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,635
It's about power.

609
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:38,870
We have two Russias.

610
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,238
Okay.

611
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,406
What are they?

612
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,541
Big like big bear.

613
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:46,711
Not very sophisticated
but instincts country.

614
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,779
Okay.

615
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,316
And the other side is the

616
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:54,219
country of intelligent
people, thoughtful people.

617
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,589
A lot of these political
leaders, are they using the

618
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,127
issue of gay rights to
appeal to a larger audience?

619
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:05,897
They try to play with bear.

620
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:06,898
Because usually what happens

621
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,399
when you play with the bear is

622
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,301
tomorrow or the next day or the

623
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:11,736
next day, the bear eats you.

624
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:12,071
Yeah.

625
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:18,676
Are you hopeful?

626
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:23,414
It's about responsibility.

627
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:26,818
We should never give up.

628
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:38,096
♪

629
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,798
Farm to table, in Russia?

630
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,667
Organic?

631
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:41,934
Local?

632
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:42,268
Why, yes.

633
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:45,937
There are those who are trying.

634
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:47,372
Sergei is a very popular

635
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:53,211
musician and leader of
the band Leningrad.

636
00:31:53,212 --> 00:32:00,451
It was banned in Moscow
purportedly for promoting

637
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:00,752
alcoholism.

638
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:05,223
Cheers.

639
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:08,126
This is Sergei's wife, Matilda.

640
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:09,560
Together they have opened this

641
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:13,731
restaurant, Kokoko, with the
mission to bring genuinely

642
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,366
local, quality Russian
food to diners.

643
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,303
We opened this restaurant one

644
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:22,307
year ago which will work only

645
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:25,843
with local farmers and we
are the first to do it.

646
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,479
In all of Russia.

647
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,381
Yes, in all of Russia.

648
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:33,484
Traditional combination, rye
bread and Russian fish.

649
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,687
Chef Igor's version of Sushi.

650
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,524
Instead of rice, more
traditional Russian black bread

651
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:44,095
with sprouts, mackerel, COD
liver and salmon caviar.

652
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:46,364
Old school, but
looks new school.

653
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:50,068
When I first came here 2001,

654
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:52,403
the best restaurant in Moscow

655
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:55,373
was a nightmare of French,

656
00:32:55,374 --> 00:33:01,012
Japanese ingredients,
recipes from nowhere.

657
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:09,013
Everyone hated Russia,
wanted to be someone else.

658
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:18,263
Lightly smoked raw beef
topped with quail egg.

659
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:19,397
Very interesting combination.

660
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:21,732
Very nice.

661
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,068
What's the most popular thing?

662
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:23,969
What do people want?

663
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:31,476
The most popular is
Italian-Japanese cuisine.

664
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:37,082
Sounds like a nightmare.

665
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:42,087
Cheers.

666
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:45,624
That was good.

667
00:33:55,734 --> 00:34:03,174
Before Putin, before Gorbachev,
Khrushchev, Stalin and

668
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,342
Lenin, there was this.

669
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,410
Imperial Russia.

670
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:08,179
Mighty palaces spread across the

671
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,647
empire where the very very few

672
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:14,619
lived in unimaginable luxury.

673
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,687
While their people
worked and starved.

674
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,989
Didn't work out so
well for Paul, did it?

675
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:19,691
Not really.

676
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:21,359
They choked the dude
to death, right?

677
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,195
Actually strangled
with a piece of cord.

678
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:27,265
The czars of previous centuries
were certainly living

679
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,699
the good life.

680
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,502
Money, no object when it came to

681
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:33,738
personal comfort or
luxurious lodgings.

682
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,708
And today's imperial powers
seem not far behind.

683
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,844
Putin allegedly had a billion

684
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,779
dollar palace built for him.

685
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,781
We couldn't license the actual

686
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:44,982
smuggled photo but our artist

687
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:49,220
rendering looks like this.

688
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:52,123
A Putin spokesman dismissed all

689
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,191
this, telling the "New York

690
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:54,559
times" we have congress halls

691
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,394
built for the Kremlin but if you

692
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:57,995
call all of them Putin's palace,

693
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:01,332
it is nothing but absurd.

694
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:01,533
Vodka.

695
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:07,505
Haven't tasted that before.

696
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:08,906
So what would I be doing on my

697
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:13,344
outing if I were a czar,
looking for cool ox to press?

698
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:20,418
Enjoying life.

699
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:21,652
Picking up some good speed here.

700
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,255
Oh, okay.

701
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,723
Some suggested that Russia

702
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:28,259
is, after all this time,
coming full circle.

703
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,262
A tiny, tiny minority in
possession of nearly unlimited

704
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:33,831
power and wealth.

705
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:36,834
The idea of running up the steps

706
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,237
and disemboweling royals, I can

707
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:40,571
easily imagine
myself doing that.

708
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,106
It would not take
much convincing.

709
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:42,874
Wow.

710
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,409
That's a pleasant surprise.

711
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,779
I would hurl them all
into the sea tomorrow.

712
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,416
After the revolution, in a

713
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:54,084
blood-forced strategy designed
to even things out, the

714
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,053
government seized private

715
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:59,890
residences, dividing them into

716
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:03,093
little pieces and portioning

717
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:03,762
them out to the masses who were

718
00:36:03,763 --> 00:36:05,196
arriving from the countryside to

719
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,398
serve the new industrialized
Soviet union.

720
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,434
I never had any ideas of growing

721
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:10,302
up in socialist wonderland.

722
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:11,702
There was a brief period when I

723
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,972
was a hippie and the idea
of living in a commune, not

724
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:15,441
attractive to me.

725
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,308
I was born in a communal flat

726
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,409
with three other families,

727
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,646
sharing one John, one kitchen.

728
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:21,913
No way.

729
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:27,151
They would treat me
when I had no food.

730
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:28,586
No way.

731
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:31,055
I share my toilet with no man.

732
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:33,591
Take the first left, please.

733
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:41,466
Meet Uri, human rights
activist, professor of

734
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:46,504
journalism, one of 26 tenants
living in this communal

735
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:47,172
apartment.

736
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:50,508
Just in case you
change your mind...

737
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:52,443
And it's here that I see for

738
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,679
first time a glimpse of my

739
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,683
friends in the years mysterious

740
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:05,189
past, growing up in a
home just like this one.

741
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:10,828
This was normal for
you growing up.

742
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:11,597
Yeah.

743
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:14,131
I show you how it workings.

744
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:19,470
So who decided to moved
into these plays?

745
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,807
Those who were in charge of

746
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:25,710
the specific communal services

747
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:30,214
assigned X amount to
this plan, to that plan.

748
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:34,552
You got to choose your
neighbors though?

749
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,521
No.

750
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:38,122
I got that.

751
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,725
In the present day Russia

752
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,327
there's never been a reason to

753
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:47,298
create infrastructure to
make people's lives bet per.

754
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,233
Nobody cared about the people

755
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:51,869
that they should have a
decent toilet or shower.

756
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,907
How is it lately, letter?

757
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:57,142
Worse.

758
00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:59,076
So he changed the

759
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,678
whole landscape in the country.

760
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:06,083
First of all he clamped down
on the Democratic right.

761
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,819
The most recent laws bring up

762
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,857
the old Soviet union type of
structure in the country.

763
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:17,728
So what happens next?

764
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:20,665
A year before the

765
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,433
Soviet union collapse, you would

766
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:25,770
never believe in your wildest
dreams it would happen.

767
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:29,407
Now it's symbolism, it looks

768
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,876
stable, people are
busy, money is made.

769
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:35,846
But it can't go on like
this for too long.

770
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,849
So Uri predict we could be in a

771
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,052
similar overnight
collapsing situation.

772
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,555
So there is some hope...
You're due for some major

773
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:47,692
renovations.

Putin's Sochi Olympics

competition which was
really all that mattered.

Russia, in broad daylight has
