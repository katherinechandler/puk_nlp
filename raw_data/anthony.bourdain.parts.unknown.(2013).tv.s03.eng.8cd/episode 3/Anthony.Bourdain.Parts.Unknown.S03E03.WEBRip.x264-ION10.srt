1
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:21,754
This is the story of one
man, one chef, and a city.

2
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,125
Also it's about France and
a lot of other chefs.

3
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,526
And a culinary tradition that

4
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:30,363
grew up to change the
world of gastronomy.

5
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,699
It's about a family tree, about

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,704
the trunk from which
many branches grew.

7
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,373
It's about food, lots
of food, great food.

8
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:48,116
Some of the greatest
food on earth.

♪ sha la la la la la la

17
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,439
What is it exactly
about this place?

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,177
Over the past century, the
system here, the tradition,

19
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:51,578
whatever it is that took hold

20
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,213
here, churned out a tremendous

21
00:01:53,214 --> 00:02:00,086
number of the world's
most important chefs.

22
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,689
Chappell, bocuse and most

23
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,392
importantly, influenced
nearly all the rest of them.

24
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:06,426
Why Lyon?

25
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:11,864
Why is this such a
gastronomic capital?

26
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,900
Why all of these great chefs?

27
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,235
Because Lyon is really

28
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,636
positioned between the
north and the south.

29
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,104
Right.

30
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:20,307
You're locked in between
burgundy and Rome.

31
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,741
Lyon is the second largest

32
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,042
city in France, situated in the

33
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,477
southeast of the country midway

34
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,078
between the alps in the east and

35
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,548
the Mediterranean to the south.

36
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:33,453
This was also a bottleneck
when cars began the mode of

37
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:33,821
transportation.

38
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:36,789
Goes right to the heart of
the idea of driving the

39
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,459
destination on the way
to... completely.

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,228
Out of that system came chefs

41
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:47,467
like this guy, Daniel Boulud.

42
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:50,770
Like prince or Madonna, he
needs really only one name.

43
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:55,342
In New York or anywhere in
the chef world, Daniel.

44
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,977
The name of his three star

45
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,279
restaurant in Manhattan, one of

46
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,080
many in an empire that stretches

47
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,149
from London to Singapore.

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,119
He came from here, a farm
outside the city of Lyon,

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,623
through the city's great

50
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,460
kitchens into New York,
then his flagship.

51
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:14,961
When did you start
working with food?

52
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,997
14 years old, 1969.

53
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,333
I started as an
apprentice in Lyon.

54
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,302
He started as so many French

55
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,271
cooks of his time did,
at the very bottom.

56
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:27,974
As a 14-year-old apprentice
in the restaurant.

57
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,509
What was your first
job in the kitchen?

58
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,113
They used to call me the
beaver, because I was just

59
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,348
washing every single day.

60
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,050
They make you clean the
vegetable, they make you carry

61
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,185
all the boxes from the market.

62
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:39,787
14.

63
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:42,655
You can't do that
anymore, can you?

64
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,723
I don't think you can make

65
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,026
him work 12 hours a day and pay

66
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,028
him maybe a buck a month.

67
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:53,132
Ah, the good old days.

68
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,034
Why Lyon?

69
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,204
Why here?

70
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,973
Look at the fundamentals, the

71
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:05,077
things that Lyonaisese
think of as birthrights.

72
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,579
The right to eat delicious cured

73
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,017
pork in unimaginably
delicious forms.

74
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:15,588
The art of chocolatery,
they can't live without it.

75
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,425
Pate, sausages, it's an art

76
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:24,064
that's revered here
and widely enjoyed.

77
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:31,103
Few names garner more
represent from aficionados of

78
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:36,443
pig.

79
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:39,746
20 ton just inside this room.

80
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:43,082
They are going mad
with the prediction.

81
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,752
In a relentlessly cold room,

82
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:48,087
pork shoulder, belly and fat

83
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,891
back are fed in batches
through a vertical chopper.

84
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:56,128
The sprinkling of
seasoning and spices.

85
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,897
Removed in large balls of finely

86
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:01,067
but not too finely chopped leek.

87
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,569
You do not want to get your hand

88
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,304
caught in one of these things.

89
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:11,711
Then mixed to smooth
perfection with a dough hook.

90
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:12,979
Lot of work.

91
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,981
Spread out and layered for

92
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,383
consistent seasoning, formed

93
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:22,088
into shapes and smacked
to remove air bubbles.

94
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,391
Make sure the meat
gets really tight.

95
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:26,393
Into the sausage machine and

96
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:31,130
piped into organic casings.

97
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:39,131
Trust me, it ain't easy.

98
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,180
Very light touch.

99
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,917
Let's see now.

100
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:51,151
Come on.

101
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:55,955
Let's see this.

102
00:05:55,956 --> 00:06:01,628
That's how you get pregnant.

103
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,362
It's all in the meat.

104
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,197
Yeah.

105
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,432
Just release at the end.

106
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,100
It's a serious workplace but

107
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,101
with production nearly done,

108
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:13,806
this being France and all, it's

109
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:14,442
time for a snack and some wine.

110
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:14,975
Doing what I'm good at.

111
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:20,346
Eating.

112
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:27,520
This is so good.

113
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,722
Another of Lyon's most famous

114
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,957
sausages is made primarily from

115
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,392
pig's head with pork belly, pork

116
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,294
shoulder, Brandy, nutmeg and

117
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:39,031
allspice mixed in for flavor.

118
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,533
Man, it's good.

119
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,068
We're going to eat
with my father.

120
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:48,675
Oh, yeah?

121
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:50,176
He knows he does
really good work.

122
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:50,644
Huh?

123
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:52,178
He knows how good his stuff is.

124
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,347
Cheers.

125
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,483
Nice... it's a
beautiful day in Lyon.

126
00:06:56,484 --> 00:07:04,484
Yeah.

127
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,262
In Lyon, a city that believes

128
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,031
absolutely in the power of food,

129
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,767
one name is everywhere.

130
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,737
The name that brought honor,
attention and millions of

131
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,105
visitors to the city.

132
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,607
Though there have been many chef

133
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:25,277
heroes in the annals of
gastronomy, in Lyon and even

134
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,281
cross France, one name
stands above all others.

135
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:34,353
Murals, Bridges, markets, casual

136
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:38,390
brasserie, the name of
missour Paul is everywhere.

137
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:43,395
One of his most enduring
institutions is this.

138
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:51,396
One of the nation's
great culinary schools.

139
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,439
Now, just to give you an idea of

140
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,274
the standards here, the kind of

141
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,609
traditional dishes, baseline old

142
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,710
school fundamentals you're

143
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,546
expected to master before you

144
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:02,882
move on at becoming a creative

145
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:10,883
genius all your own,
meet these guys.

146
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:19,465
Matthew, Joseph and the
institute's top dog, Alain.

147
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,301
Chefs at M.O.S., all.

148
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,936
Otherwise known as mos.

149
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,839
Otherwise pay your
flight home, private.

150
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,274
Master chefs.

151
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:35,014
Every four years, they
have this competition.

152
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,449
The master craftsmen of France.

153
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,654
There's about 30 discipline
of craftsmen where you can

154
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,623
acquire the M.O.F.

155
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:49,929
See that red, white and
blue around their necks?

156
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,598
That means they made it through

157
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:55,968
the rigorous competition where
only a handful survive.

158
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,970
Certified by the highest in the

159
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,939
land as being at the very top of

160
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:06,212
the top of their professions.

161
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,315
M.O.F. Challenges often include

162
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,050
ultra old school classics not

163
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:16,288
unlike the one we're
making today.

164
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:23,195
Poulair Au visse.

165
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,064
The rolls Royce of chickens.

166
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,466
It's then tied, slipped inside a

167
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,302
pig's bladder and
steamed until tender.

168
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,838
The idea is to concentrate

169
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,908
the flavor of the truffle
inside the bladder.

170
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,209
The dish they choose, it's

171
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,579
always in reference to
a chef of the past.

172
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,152
And this was a dish
they were doing.

173
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,654
The at times brutal world of

174
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:49,856
the kitchen looks much of the

175
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:53,225
time like a boys' club but
where did they come from?

176
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,861
If we track back a bit to where

177
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,228
it all began for Lyon and for

178
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,997
many of the chefs whose names we

179
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:05,604
now know and look up to,
it all goes back to here.

180
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:10,710
La mer brass Erie, the
godmother, the original master.

181
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,444
Teacher, chef, force.

182
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:17,583
Two restaurants with
three Michelin stars.

183
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,752
An achievement no one, male or

184
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,887
female, had attained and for

185
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:25,024
many years, Lyon's
most famous chef.

186
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,558
Her influence runs right through

187
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,895
every kitchen that's come since

188
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:30,697
and her graduates carry on her

189
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:35,467
recipes and her traditions.

190
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,036
This was one of
hers, a signature.

191
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:40,539
For the next hour, you
keep putting it like this.

192
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,409
The most miserable thing is
when the bladder explodes.

193
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,945
That's never a good thing
when a bladder explodes.

194
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:50,750
As the chicken proves, the
bladder is really tough to

195
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:50,984
expand.

196
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:53,052
You have to talk
to your bladder.

197
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,553
I do all the time, believe me.

198
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,922
Please hold up, please hold up.

199
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:56,757
Not here, people are looking.

200
00:10:56,758 --> 00:10:59,258
Wait until you get
in between cars.

201
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,094
A rather luxurious sauce of

202
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,330
more, much more black truffle

203
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:09,635
and generous amounts of
foie gras and triple cream.

204
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,670
Perfect.

205
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:19,671
Nice milkshake.

206
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,014
Slightly pink around the legs

207
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,515
but cooked through, the flesh

208
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,185
perfumed by the generous
slices of truffle.

209
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,154
Who gets to eat like this?

210
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:32,759
We do.

211
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,626
How is it?

212
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,327
Divine.

213
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:36,195
You see the perfect
balance in the sauce.

214
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,529
If I was a chicken, that's the

215
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,798
way I would like to end up.

216
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,166
Even if I weren't a chicken,

217
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,101
I would like to go like this.

218
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,936
Die surrounded by truffles and

219
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,840
foie gras and fine wine.

220
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,911
Merci. Merci.

221
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,227
The roaring of a
powerful engine.

222
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,830
The screech of rubber
and off we go.

223
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:14,133
Kings of the road
in our Citroen.

224
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:19,872
Two horse power classic.

225
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,340
No power steering, huh?

226
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:26,245
You're kidding.

227
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,180
It's like a toy car.

228
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,715
We're going back in time a bit,

229
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,551
to the area where Daniel
grew up, where life was very

230
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,753
different from New York.

231
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,357
Were you the misfit of the
family, rebellious or...

232
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,092
I was quite rebellious.

233
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,593
My parents were talking to me

234
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,430
about the idea of
taking over the farm.

235
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,998
As the oldest son, that would

236
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,567
have been the logical thing.

237
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:48,836
Right.

238
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:50,202
The farmer's life
was not for you.

239
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:50,703
No.

240
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,172
He grew up in a
true farm family.

241
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,342
You milk the cows,
tended the animals.

242
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,677
Daniel claims he never even saw

243
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:06,678
processed food until
he was a teenager.

244
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,243
A brief respite by the side

245
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,112
of the road and some passersby

246
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,480
are apparently less appreciative

247
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,116
of fine automobiles than we are.

248
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,985
A short consultation with an

249
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:39,652
automotive professional and we

250
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:43,923
are back on the road, back
in this case to school.

251
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:47,059
This was Daniel's old elementary

252
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:53,099
school in a nearby town.

253
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,666
I'm automatically taken back to

254
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,635
memories of my own school days.

255
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,437
The smell of caustic pine

256
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,307
cleaner, chalkboards and fear.

257
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:05,844
The cruel ministrations of

258
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,613
tiny-eyed lunch ladies slopping

259
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:11,918
canloads of prison chow
into steam tables.

260
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,119
Tuna noodle surprise that haunt

261
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,993
my sense memories still.

262
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:24,696
Pumpkin soup today with

263
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,599
onion, nutmeg and chicken stock.

264
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,268
Basic good pumpkin soup.

265
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:33,605
This is Marie, head chef,

266
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,307
cook, host and server for 320

267
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,875
hungry and very discriminating

268
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,445
French schoolchildren
ages 3 to 12.

269
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:47,446
On the menu, prefix today,
pumpkin soup, home made

270
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,159
cous-cous and a sauce supreme.

271
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,462
This is a very sophisticated
meal for children.

272
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,197
I was a little...
In school, frankly.

273
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,398
Like a lot of other students, I

274
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,899
want pizza, pizza, pizza, are

275
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,237
the children here
open to variety?

276
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,239
We want to make sure they

277
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,041
always get a little challenge by

278
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,709
how the food looks and the smell

279
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,744
and also, the taste after.

280
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,347
I think she has a
very strict budget.

281
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,915
In the USA, greatest country

282
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,419
in the world, no doubt, we spend

283
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,055
an average of $2.75 per student

284
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,024
for public school lunch.

285
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:26,993
Compare and contrast.

286
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:27,894
$1.50.

287
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:29,228
Did you eat this well
when you were here?

288
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:37,229
Absolutely.

289
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,239
Bon jour.

290
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,275
The kids attack their food

291
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,078
like hungry trenchmen, wiping

292
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,247
out three servings in the
time it takes me to eat one.

293
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,248
I guess they like it.

294
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,549
It's good.

295
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,783
This is good.

296
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:59,784
I don't think my chef in
new York would do better.

297
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,727
These kids eat fast.

298
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,896
Look how fast this kid eats.

299
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,298
Turn your head, he'll dish your

300
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,967
food right out of your plate.

301
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,969
Push up your tray just like
in prison, move it along.

302
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,071
Move it along.

303
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,073
They come to you and serve you.

304
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,443
Most important thing that we see

305
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:18,744
here is the love Mary give to

306
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,447
the food she make and
to the kids she serves.

307
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:22,881
I think it has a lot to do with

308
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,484
the reaction they have to food.

309
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,255
Dessert is homemade fromage

310
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,057
blanc, cheese with chocolate
and orange segments.

311
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:34,060
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

312
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:41,133
Fireman.

313
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:41,634
Generate machine gun.

314
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,170
He wants to make...
Generate machine gun, yeah.

315
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:44,671
Okay.

316
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,172
Keep an eye on that one.

317
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:53,173
All right.

318
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,482
For a dope fiend, feeding the
monkey means finding and

319
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,783
sticking with heroin.

320
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,619
For one poor guy, it's this.

321
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:08,620
French food, in particular,
lyonaise food.

322
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,964
The cautionary tale of bill

323
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,366
Buford, literary lion with a

324
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,368
perfectly good job as fiction

325
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,637
editor at "new yorker" magazine,

326
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,307
at the undignified age of 53, he

327
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,708
pretty much pulled up stakes,

328
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,210
put his whole past life on hold

329
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,645
and defected to France
to learn how to cook.

330
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,014
What happened to you?

331
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,983
You used to have a good job, you

332
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,053
hung out a couple nights with

333
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,455
battagli and next thing you know

334
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,889
you're living in
France and cooking.

335
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,526
I discovered a whole world
that the rest of the world

336
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,528
didn't seem to know about, just

337
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,996
a very compressed and tense

338
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,898
lifelong learned expertise
and knowledge of food.

339
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,467
It's not the food network and

340
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,402
it's not glossy magazines and

341
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,738
it's not something you get
from reading a recipe book.

342
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,840
It's something you get
by just going deep.

343
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:59,911
I was afraid of France because I

344
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,047
didn't find when I took on the

345
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,149
subject of French food, I would

346
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,316
have to go really deep.

347
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,351
I went and thought we would have

348
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:11,323
to stay for six months and
we stayed for five years.

349
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:16,328
We meet at a uniquely lyonaise
institution, a casual

350
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:20,266
laid-back kind of pub/bistro

351
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,034
with a limited old school menu

352
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,738
and always, always an
unpreten shouse vibe.

353
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,006
People come here to unwind,

354
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:31,710
relax and eat with abandon.

355
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:34,613
So you say outright recently in

356
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,614
one of your published works that

357
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,850
Lyon is better than Paris.

358
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,953
Lyon is beautiful, well-eating
city and everybody

359
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,889
here knows they have a really

360
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,926
good life and they don't give a

361
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,761
flying fig if anybody
else knows about it.

362
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:53,265
They don't actually
want visitors.

363
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:59,538
If you were to pick one
iconic dish to represent, it

364
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,974
would have to be
the canel broche.

365
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,743
Not particularly fabulous river

366
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,078
fish, pike, folded into a light

367
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,315
dough until fluffy and airy but

368
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,783
still rich, adrift in a rich

369
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:15,587
creamy, almost bisque-like sauce

370
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:21,593
made with crayfish,
creme fresh and Brandy.

371
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:28,133
It's kind of a nice mix
of France and Italy.

372
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:32,339
What a treat to eat
together in Lyon.

373
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:49,655
If you're really gonna
understand a place, love it the

374
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:50,623
way it deserves to be loved,

375
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:51,591
maybe you have to live there.

376
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:54,426
Bill Buford did just that
and made Lyon his home.

377
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,761
Today he's taking me somewhere

378
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,095
only someone from the home team

379
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,797
could be expected to know about.

380
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,367
It's a beautiful day.

381
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,469
The sky is blue, we're feeling

382
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,203
the seasons changing and we're

383
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,038
about to go into a dark room,

384
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,009
and you eat a very lyonaise menu

385
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,211
and drink a vast
quantity of wine.

386
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,646
What sinister bodies
will be in there?

387
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,114
Only kind of people who would

388
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,617
do this kind of thing on a

389
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,787
bright pretty day, its's
a very male tradition.

390
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:29,788
You work hard, you drink harder.

391
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:34,866
Uh-oh.

392
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:35,867
Don't be afraid.

393
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,035
Don't be afraid.

394
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,170
The mysterious, fabulous,

395
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,474
goofy, wonderful bro-fests are

396
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,975
basically eating and drinking

397
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,811
societies that go back over a

398
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,212
century, when the silk workers

399
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,847
of Lyon would finish their night

400
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,582
shifts early in the morning.

401
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,883
Hungry and looking to get, shall

402
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:56,187
we say, completely hammered,

403
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,589
they would take over, stuff

404
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,991
their faces like heroes, blow

405
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,661
off the proverbial steam in

406
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,029
decidedly French fashion, which

407
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:10,035
is to say no freakin' guytallion

408
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:16,875
nachos or mozzerella
sticks for these guys.

409
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,345
All of them have
special memberships?

410
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:21,279
There must be 50 of those
that I know about.

411
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,549
You are invited to be a member

412
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,950
and remain a member the
rest of your life.

413
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,119
The food is invariably

414
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,088
deliciously dinosauric and heavy

415
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,423
always glorious classics, the

416
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,025
slow, slowly stewed neck and

417
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,794
shoulder pieces of veal with

418
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,128
mushrooms served over rice,

419
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:45,129
hunks of bread and
wine, and lots of it.

420
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,813
It works, and for 50 years.

421
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,748
Do women have their
own organizations?

422
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,550
Yes.

423
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,418
There are.

424
00:21:58,419 --> 00:21:59,651
So somewhere on the other side

425
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,952
of town, there are a lot of

426
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:05,791
women sitting around drinking

427
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:06,726
wine, eating and
complaining about the men.

428
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:06,993
Uh-oh.

429
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,994
Then there will
be, yes, singing.

430
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,764
And no doubt the telling of

431
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:20,765
lusty jokes followed by
serious official business.

432
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,453
Alongside and some say above

433
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:09,120
the names of the other culinary

434
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:17,121
giants in and around Lyon
is the name trois gros.

435
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,369
It sparked a dynasty of culinary

436
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,237
excellence that continues today

437
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:29,841
with Pierre's son Michel
and his son, Cesar.

438
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:37,842
My dream always was to
put it on my resume.

439
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,919
Bon jour.

440
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,256
Many have called Maison trois

441
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,059
gros the best restaurant
in the world.

442
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,327
In the '60s, the brothers were

443
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,096
early, important and fundamental

444
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,397
innovators of what came to be

445
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:57,836
known as nouvelle cuisine.

446
00:23:57,837 --> 00:24:00,906
Behold, one of their
breakout classics.

447
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:04,042
One of the truly game-changing,

448
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:07,913
timeless, most influential
dishes in history.

449
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:10,381
It seems now maybe a simple

450
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,250
thing, but it absolutely turned

451
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,252
the world upside down when it

452
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,755
debuted on the menu in 1962.

453
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,757
When you have a dish this

454
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,259
legendary, this iconic,
there's no escaping it.

455
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,728
The rolling stones will always

456
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,395
have to play jumping Jack flash.

457
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:30,736
If you Google foie gras,
you will see this thing.

458
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,738
Forget everything you
have been given.

459
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:36,875
Before this, fish was
generally overcooked.

460
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:40,746
It was served alongside
elaborate garnishes, starches,

461
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:41,080
vegetables.

462
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:43,749
This simple, elegant, almost

463
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,284
Japanese ode to flavor changed
the way we cook fish in

464
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,319
restaurants today.

465
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,824
And how we make sauces,
what our plates look like.

466
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,227
I remember seeing a picture
of this as a young man.

467
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,263
I'm getting goosebumps
seeing this.

468
00:24:58,264 --> 00:24:59,165
Thrilling.

469
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:02,167
Perfect.

470
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:06,605
It's beautiful.

471
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:13,979
The moment you put
the fish in the pan.

472
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,648
It's very important.

473
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:24,649
All right.

474
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:32,698
From now, to you in the
dining room in one minute.

475
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:33,799
One minute is the time.

476
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,033
Perfect.

477
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:42,034
Because it's cooking
all the way.

478
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:42,842
Mm.

479
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:43,942
Perfect.

480
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:45,110
It's a perfect dish.

481
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,177
It's really one of the great

482
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:52,684
ideas of the 20th century.

483
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:52,985
Fashionable.

484
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:56,756
Sexy.

485
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,703
When in Lyon, one can't help

486
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:14,806
but a see line from there, from

487
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,708
the rustic dishes of the farm to

488
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,878
here, the classics of the
great tables of Europe.

489
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,079
All roads lead here.

490
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,483
A major trunk of the tree that

491
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:33,484
goes back to karem and beyond.

492
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,162
Monseur Paul Bocuse.

493
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:37,730
The brigade.

494
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:42,668
The way it is done and has
always been done since a

495
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:43,902
military style hierarchy was

496
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:49,274
instituted into the kitchen.

497
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,242
When the only acceptable

498
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:57,115
response to any question or
any command is oui, chef.

499
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:02,253
This is the special forces,
the S.a.S., of cooking.

500
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,290
And these cooks live to avoid,

501
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:10,095
under any circumstances,
disappointing their comrades,

502
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,798
the hierarchy or monseur Paul.

503
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,265
Daniel worked here and so have

504
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,600
many, many who have gone on to

505
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:19,037
run their own
celebrated kitchens.

506
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:21,940
In the '70s as a young wanna-be

507
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,942
cook, I managed to lay hands on

508
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:29,380
a French copy of the classic

509
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,283
cookbook, La Cuisine Du Marche

510
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,419
and I struggled to translate the

511
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,722
descriptions of dishes so
fantastic I was quite sure I

512
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:44,723
never, ever in my life
would cook, much less eat.

513
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,403
If you could please say how

514
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,805
honored and grateful
I am to be here.

515
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:56,341
This is a dream come true.

516
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,609
Over the years, how many great

517
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,012
chefs have come through this

518
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:09,013
restaurant and on to
open great restaurants?

519
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,695
There is a child somewhere
around the world because

520
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:25,336
everybody goes around the world.

521
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,138
But he is and was
part of the system.

522
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,974
He came up with his own cruel

523
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:36,975
and terrifying masters and
their faces are here.

524
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,353
The towering and intimidating

525
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:45,723
figure behind la pyramid.

526
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,559
Owl out of his
kitchens same such

527
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,898
figures as Francois Biese,

528
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:56,301
George Perrier and many more.

529
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:59,737
This was all the gang of
the nouvelle cuisine.

530
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,708
The '60s in New York.

531
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,343
Every great chef I have ever

532
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:08,880
met has nightmares of they're

533
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:10,548
still a young man, they're back

534
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,886
in a kitchen and a chef
is yelling at him.

535
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,554
Who were his masters?

536
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:16,856
A woman.

537
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:20,758
Really?

538
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:27,098
La mer brassier at the ripe old

539
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,700
age of 20, he worked
as an apprentice.

540
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:34,039
She was such a screamer.

541
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,207
You would fall on your butt, she

542
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,043
was screaming so hard.

543
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:39,110
She was the first up in the

544
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,546
morning and the last
one to go to bed.

545
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:44,415
She would go to the market with

546
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:45,450
three cook in the back of the

547
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,751
truck and she would put the case

548
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,053
of green beans or something and

549
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:49,754
the cook will be sitting down

550
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:52,557
making the beans,
not to waste time.

551
00:29:52,558 --> 00:30:00,298
Truly a terrifying figure.

552
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,733
Truffle soup Elyssee.

553
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,202
I can't tell you how many hours

554
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:08,039
I stared at photos of this dish,

555
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,575
how pathetically I
tried to replicate it.

556
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:11,543
Never did I think I would get to

557
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:18,449
try it, much less like this.

558
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,552
Sea bass with a tomato bernaise

559
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,322
sauce baked in a
meticulously crafted crust.

560
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:31,162
This is a great moment.

561
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:35,800
The fish is filled with a
delicate lobster mousse and

562
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,436
tarragon and wrapped
carefully in pastry.

563
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:45,476
Notice the careful and
tableside carving and service.

564
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,679
He has been making the
same thing for 50 years.

565
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:54,652
Paul has an amazing
respect for classic.

566
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:58,289
The peasant classic.

567
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,258
Tony, get closer.

568
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,960
You are totally sending me

569
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,528
every one of those
pictures, by the way.

570
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:03,695
Wow.

571
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,463
Look at that.

572
00:31:04,464 --> 00:31:05,796
This style of dish goes back

573
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,865
long before cameras
but it's perfect.

574
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:13,704
Is there a more perfect
assortment of colors and

575
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,040
textures.

576
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:17,342
This one is a somewhat
more luxurious version.

577
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:20,111
Beef flanks, oxtail, veal

578
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,980
flanks, chicken, marrow bones,

579
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:25,016
beef ribs, leeks, carrots,

580
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:30,021
turnips, fennel and parsnips,

581
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,057
served with its own
deeply rich broth.

582
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,624
Think it's enough
for the two of us?

583
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:41,625
And then, this.

584
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:43,801
As if the chef had been

585
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:47,072
listening to my deepest, darkest

586
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:54,980
secret yearnings, an almost
completely disappeared,

587
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,914
incredibly difficult
preparation of wild hare.

588
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,850
The animal is first slowly

589
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,719
cooked, then coated by a sauce

590
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,256
of its own minced heart, liver
and lungs that has been

591
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,225
thickened with its own blood.

592
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,060
After more than six hours of

593
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,928
preparation, the hare is served

594
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,331
as the chef prefers, whole on

595
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,100
the bone, the rich glorious

596
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:23,101
sauce finished with truffles
and chartr chartreuse.

597
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,279
Absolutely the lost
ark of the covenant.

598
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,514
Everything great about cooking
is encapsulated in this

599
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,382
dish.

600
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,517
We continue all over the

601
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:35,920
world to make cuisine for
many generation to come.

602
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:36,555
Forever.

603
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:38,589
I will never eat like
this again in my life.

604
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,292
Chef, merci.

605
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,293
The meal of my life.

606
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,395
Today I was treated to the

607
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:48,433
greatest hits of a glorious
and fabled career.

608
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,268
For the first and probably the

609
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:51,636
last time, I sat next to the

610
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,970
great man himself and Daniel and

611
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,440
I were served a menu that chefs

612
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:58,409
will look back on in a hundred

613
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,146
years and smile at appreciably,

614
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,715
sentimentally, respectfully.

615
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,801
So me and Daniel were going
hunting and over lunch, we

616
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:26,604
mentioned that fact to Paul, who

617
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,106
immediately insisted, insisted

618
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:29,774
that if we wanted to go duck

619
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,976
hunting, we should come by his

620
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:34,011
crib, and so we find ourselves

621
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,314
in the morning mist of Le dawn,

622
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:39,250
a rural area about a
half hour outside Lyon.

623
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,419
Sure enough, in spite of his 88

624
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,687
years, and the fact that he's

625
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,855
been less than well, 9:00 A.M.

626
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,824
On the nose, there he is,

627
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,493
sitting on top of his beloved

628
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:53,030
John Deere with his
faithful dog ready to go.

629
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,334
Nice fresh morning.

630
00:33:56,335 --> 00:34:00,771
That dog is happy.

631
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:07,678
The great chef loves this
place, and you can see why.

632
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,850
♪

633
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:18,022
Monsuer Paul can't safely
hunt but is happy to chase

634
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:26,023
around flushing birds for us.

635
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:29,968
Beautiful.

636
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,336
Yeah, it is beautiful.

637
00:34:31,337 --> 00:34:37,875
I could do this all day.

638
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:45,876
That was about as good
as we're going to get.

639
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:49,053
If you look long enough,
you start hallucinating.

640
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:54,825
You start hallucinating ducks
where there aren't any.

641
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:59,029
You see that one falling?

642
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,565
Okay, not a moment to waste.

643
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:07,004
Quickly, a second shot.

644
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:07,206
Okay.

645
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:10,741
You got it?

646
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:11,009
Yeah.

647
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:17,248
Right there.

648
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,517
Between me and Daniel and the

649
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,353
dog, we managed to
actually bag a few ducks.

650
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:29,694
Good job.

651
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:29,961
Very good.

652
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,530
Easy shot.

653
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:35,132
Then it's back to the lodge,

654
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,134
clearly Paul's happy place,
where we meet up with some

655
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,370
hunting buddies of
the great chef.

656
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,772
You did a good job, no?

657
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,773
Success.

658
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:46,744
Yeah.

659
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:54,385
It's fantastic.

660
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,153
Is this the hunting lodge,

661
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,289
the weekend getaway,
hang out with the guys?

662
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:06,290
That's where he comes
every day, almost.

663
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:10,735
Look at the picture behind.

664
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:18,736
You see?

665
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:21,946
For tonight's meal, we pluck

666
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:26,016
and roast some woodcocks
over an open fire.

667
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:34,017
Cook up some well-aged
duck and pheasant.

668
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:42,293
They make mashed potato here.

669
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,701
There a head in there somewhere?

670
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:48,339
Yes, of course.

671
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:56,340
That's happiness right there.

672
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:01,852
I am a man of simple needs.

673
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:08,393
And I notice... we can
spend the whole week

674
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:11,161
and we'll be hunting, we'll be

675
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,164
cooking, eating, drinking, and

676
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:22,165
talking and that's beautiful.

677
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,714
It is for me a dream to spend
this time with a legend.

678
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:33,150
But I'm thrilled that Beaucoup

679
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:41,151
himself seems delighted.

680
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,697
In Lyonnes, he's the great chef,

681
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:50,234
a public figure, a
hero, an institution.

682
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,837
Always treated with the
greatest deference.

683
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,204
Here it appear he's free to

684
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,707
enjoy the simple things with

685
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:57,942
friends, local farmers who talk

686
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:02,112
to him like anybody else.

687
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,452
It's a pretty damn
magical thing to see.

688
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,801
Daniel might be a 3
star Michelin chef but

689
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,637
like so many of his
predecessors, he's basically a

690
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:27,473
farm boy.

691
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:30,140
He grew up milking cows and

692
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,276
doing farm work here on
his family's spread.

693
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:35,980
There is as it turns out,
something of a restaurant

694
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:36,815
tradition to build on.

695
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:39,116
The house on his farm was once a

696
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,985
cafe as well, operated first by

697
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:44,589
his grandparents and
great grandparents.

698
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:49,894
The famous cafe Boulou was not

699
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,096
the first place to
keep that name.

700
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:53,831
That kept it for 80 years,

701
00:38:53,832 --> 00:39:01,832
100 year, then they closed it.

702
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,449
Meeting hi dad, one seems to

703
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:17,622
understand the roots
of his perfectionism.

704
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:25,623
His mom, dad, wife Katherine and

705
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,598
Danielle collaborate
with some debate.

706
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,635
On a super old school
farmhouse classic.

707
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:32,369
The sort of things good times,

708
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,338
bad times, a family could make

709
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:37,374
with stuff always readily
available on the farm.

710
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,276
Check this out.

711
00:39:38,277 --> 00:39:41,345
It's a hollowed out pumpkin

712
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:45,450
layered with toasted chunkses of

713
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:49,019
stale bread, nutmeg, grated

714
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,621
cheese, mushrooms, fresh cream

715
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:54,158
from the cows and the
meat of the pumpkin.

716
00:39:54,159 --> 00:40:00,465
And a layer of bacon also.

717
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:08,466
Oh, man, it's heavy.

718
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,340
Are you concerned the pumpkin

719
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,644
is go I think to try to get out?

720
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:21,645
His dad can be a bit of a
mcgooi mcelhi McGyver.

721
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:29,059
You don't waste stuff and
he's a bit of an inventor.

722
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:37,060
An old washing machine
turned still.

723
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:47,545
To seal it so there's
no air coming in.

724
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:50,080
Leftover grape solids usually

725
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:58,081
used to be make liquor,
today a different use.

726
00:40:58,256 --> 00:40:59,057
If we can get it out of here.

727
00:40:59,058 --> 00:41:07,058
Why did you put so
much cement on it?

728
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:13,638
We'll be using this delightfully

729
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:16,073
funky stuff to flavor the steam

730
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:24,074
that cooks the vegetables
from inside the still.

731
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:31,421
Then we come back in an hour.

732
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:35,626
At Dutinsk we settle for dinner.

733
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:37,461
Look at that.

734
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:38,596
Ion credible.

735
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:38,964
Look at that.

736
00:41:38,965 --> 00:41:41,065
Wow.

737
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:42,967
The pumpkin is amazing.

738
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:47,071
We also have that great sausage.

739
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:51,942
Oh, look at that.

740
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:56,013
Cabbage and potatoes, all
steamed in the still.

741
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:58,182
The flavor you get from the
fermented grape, awesome.

742
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:58,383
Good.

743
00:41:58,384 --> 00:42:00,484
So good.

744
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:03,588
As you know Danielle can't
really help himself.

745
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:04,822
He's popping up and down,

746
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:05,990
serving everybody, making sure

747
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:07,858
everything is just right.

748
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,026
Sitting here with his family in

749
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,527
the house he grew up in, you can

750
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:18,202
see where it all comes from.

751
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:22,172
Their son is now a gigantic
international success.

752
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,708
When he was a young man at 14

753
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:30,448
sneezing in the field, did
they ever anticipate this?

754
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:35,921
We do.

755
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:38,989
They all reflect the
region hopefully.

756
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,190
But in the best case,
they're interdependent.

757
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,827
They come from each other.

758
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:45,429
In fact, who cooks in
the great restaurants?

759
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,564
Farm boys basically.

760
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,633
That's who always cooked.

761
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:50,567
My deepest thanks to your
mother an your father.

762
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,069
Thank you.

763
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,803
Merci.

764
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:56,642
Next time my father will
make you drive the tractor.
