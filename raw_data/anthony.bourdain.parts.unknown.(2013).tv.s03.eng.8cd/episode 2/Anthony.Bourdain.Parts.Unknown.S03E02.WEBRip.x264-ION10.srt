2

what to do with it, who can't

5

how to spend their money.

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:20,187
In the old days, you would
throw it on a table.

7
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:23,823
Put that in the context of
throwing away a bottle of

8
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,592
seven-up in a club.

9
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:27,026
We're slightly more
honest about it.

10

You're talking crass
commercialism in the very best

sense of the word.

This is it.

00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,736
Is it the cultural
center of the country?

We may not want to think
it is, but is it?

It wasn't that somebody came out

In Vegas, there's
winners and losers.

to Vegas and behave
really, really badly.

107
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:09,001
I think it's encouraged
people to be their worst.

108

00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:51,991
blitzer was coming, that he
was expected any minute.

184
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:59,498
I suggested that wolf might
be hungry and they sent up

185
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,267
geesavoir.

186
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:02,101
Fortunately he doesn't watch a

187
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,502
lot of television and I plan to

188
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,873
live large until they figure
out wolf ain't coming.

189
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,607
I'll deal with the
fallout later.

190
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:13,846
But for now, we live.

191
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,715
This dish, everything
is in layers.

192
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,217
In the bottom of the glass you

193
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,120
will find caviar vinaigrette,

194
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:27,526
topped with puree of
French string bean.

195
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:33,632
Then finishing the dish
with caviar sauvignon.

196
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,034
Oh, beautiful.

197
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:36,602
Look at that.

198
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,305
It's rare that I say it's
too beautiful to eat.

199
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,742
I was just thinking that.

200
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:47,213
Oh, speaking of
fantastically luxurious...

201
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:53,485
This is a specialty.

202
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,288
Oh, man.

203
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,157
That's truffle.

204
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:02,561
Mm.

205
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:10,562
This is a combination of
pheasant, rabbit, seared foir

206
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,774
gras and cabbage.

207
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:15,274
That is beautiful.

208
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,508
You feel guilty
eating this well?

209
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:16,810
I do.

210
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,677
You do?

211
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,245
I do.

212
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,913
I'm feeling guilty now
but it will pass.

213
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:28,914
I will follow you.

214
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,257
Wow.

215
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,926
You ever even seen
anything like this?

216
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,427
I haven't seen anything
like this anywhere.

217
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,462
Yeah, me either.

218
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:39,098
The thing is, you can see the

219
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,167
main pool in front
of the window here.

220
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:44,170
You can see the hoi paloi.

221
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,704
I was thinking of inviting

222
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,439
them up to our crib for a party.

223
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,375
Don't you do that.

224
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:48,541
No.

225
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,677
Don't they deserve a good time?

226
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:52,012
I don't know.

227
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:53,946
Maybe not.

228
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:54,981
Not going to happen.

229
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,216
We're getting back to guilt.

230
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,651
Do you feel enlightened and
inspired by this meal?

231
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,686
What are you asking?

232
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,154
What are you getting at here?

233
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,422
You're trying to
get at something.

234
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,957
Trying to make
myself feel better.

235
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,060
I'm trying to prove that I'm
down with the people, man.

236
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:08,896
I'm still cool.

237
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:10,496
This guilt keeps coming back.

238
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,730
You keep bringing up the guilt.

239
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,099
You're right.

240
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,069
I feel guilty.

241
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,737
What are you doing here if
you feel so guilty about it?

242
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,972
I don't.

243
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:20,407
I don't.

244
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,541
I feel guilty about
not feeling guilty.

245
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,044
That's more to the point.

246
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,045
Now you're being
honest with yourself.

247
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:30,083
Right.

248
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,033
It's so easy to say I came

249
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,868
out here because it's
a lot of opportunity.

250
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,202
Well, that's really great.

251
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:56,408
If you're not here for that,
why else are you here?

252
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,744
It's the good old wreck
your life scenario.

253
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,612
That's always pretty popular.

254
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,381
You can change your mind about

255
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:06,018
wrecking your life,
now what do I do.

256
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,855
There's a lot less
self-reflection about why people

257
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:13,792
are here than there is
about most other places.

258
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:20,699
What a lost opportunity that is.

259
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,571
Sinatra and the mob are gone
but there remains still a

260
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:26,539
certain sentimental attachment

261
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,607
to the way things used to be.

262
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,609
There were rules then, a way

263
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,078
that things were done, and when

264
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,712
they weren't done, there was

265
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:36,548
always the desert and
a hole in the ground.

266
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,885
Also, there were lounges and rub

267
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,452
joints and places where a man

268
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,754
could get a proper plate of

269
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:47,927
Italian American
meatballs and spaghets.

270
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,495

still such places.

running it for 41 years.

00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,558
to eat in Vegas,
casual but pricey.

366
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,527
Pricey because the ingredients,

367
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,261
many from around the world.

368
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,430
There is sea urchin
from Santa Barbara.

369
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,299
Okay, that's not
too far, but good.

370
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,601
The tuna is from Spain
where it's best.

371
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:59,238
The fresh river crab from Japan.

372
00:18:59,239 --> 00:18:59,806
That was good, right?

373
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,072
Yeah.

374
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,974
Delicious.

375
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,243
I didn't know oysters
came that big.

376
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,145
Oh, yeah.

377
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:12,584
Sashimi, juicy deep
fried chicken.

378
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,320
And one of my favorites, fish

379
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,088
collar, where all the best,

380
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,960
tastiest, moistest, meatiest
bits hide their favors.

381
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,729
Penn has been living here and

382
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,233
performing here for
over 20 years.

383
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:27,800
He knows.

384
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,969
The thing about magic is, you

385
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,672
cannot see it electronically.

386
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,575
Many people come to Vegas are

387
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,610
people that see one or two live

388
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,246
shows a year and if you see one

389
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:42,748
or two live shows, you might as

390
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,251
well see something that
you can only see live.

391
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:45,918
Right.

392
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,288
You can never, ever see a
magician anywhere but live.

393
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,824
These days for better or
worse, live acts, live

394
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,293
performers, are being squeezed

395
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:58,297
out in favor of EDF,
electronic dance music.

396
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,131
It's a deejay's world and where

397
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,267
once they used to say cocaine

398
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,001
was god's way of telling you had

399
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,472
too much money,
now maybe EDM is.

400
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,139
We get invited to all the

401
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,542
openings of the new clubs but I

402
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,977
simply don't understand it.

403
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,645
I'm embarrassed that I
don't understand it.

404
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:14,481
Are we just old?

405
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:18,484
I think that might be it.

406
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,551
I don't know.

407
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,020
You want to spin it the latter,

408
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,722
I'm afraid it might
be the former.

409
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,658
Used to be a whole spectrum
of entertainers who existed

410
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,460
almost entirely in Vegas.

411
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,695
Danny Ganz was huge here.

412
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:30,062
Wayne Newton.

413
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,830
They were gods.

414
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,899
But what's the big
money draw now?

415
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,971
This.

416
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,908
Come, ye lords and princelings.

417
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,511
Here my clarion call.

418
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:49,014
Anointed thyself with gel
and heavenly body spray.

419
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,817
Maketh the sign of the devil
horns with thine hands.

420
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,385
Let there be high-fiving and the

421
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,021
hugging of many bros, for this

422
00:20:56,022 --> 00:21:00,025
is the kingdom and the power.

423
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:06,031
Now frolic and
maketh it to rain.

424
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:06,566
Power.

425
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,233
It's crazy.

426
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,768
Press a button and
people respond.

427
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:14,205
They do, man.

428
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,207
Wednesday night at the marquee.

429
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,378
Deejay Jason Lima
works for the house.

430
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,413
Tonight at marquee and in other

431
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,915
clubs like it around Vegas,
somewhere between 8,000 and

432
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,017
10,000 people are going to stop

433
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:32,023
by and drop a whole
boatload of cash.

434
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:36,595
It's not just coming in here
and ordering a bottle and

435
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:37,397
sitting there drinking it.

436
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:42,901
You get a full-on
group experience.

437
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:48,540
The new money, the new Vegas,
where the take at the big

438
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,641
nightclubs is outpacing the take

439
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:50,809
from gambling and slots.

440
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,778
Where everybody for the right

441
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,412
price and with enough sparkles

442
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:57,616
and the right mix
can be a winner.

443
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,918
After you finish work, how long

444
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,121
does it take for your
adrenaline to level off?

445
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:03,956
At least an hour.

446
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:08,494
What are your dreams like now?

447
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,895
I'm not going to lie.

448
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:13,665
Sometimes I close my eyes and
I still see the strobes.

449
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:18,437
Ears are ringing.

450
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:23,175
Still got like flash
of the strobe lights.

451
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,164
Las Vegas is an adult playland.

452
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,635
And that's what we intend to be.

453
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:51,369
If people want to see Mickey

454
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,839
mouse, they can go 175
miles down the road.

455
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,207
If they want to see bugsy Siegel

456
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,209
under a rock, they stay here.

457
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,846
Is there a Mr. Vegas like

458
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,381
Elvis or Wayne Newton or
bugsy Siegel used to be?

459
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:07,453
If there is, it would
probably be this guy.

460
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:09,888
Former mayor Oscar Goodman.

461
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,223
A man who knows allegedly and to

462
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,725
the best of my knowledge where

463
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,861
all the bodies are buried, some

464
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:19,130
of them equally allegedly by
some of his former clients.

466
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,832
We meet over drinks at Oscar's,

467
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,468
the steakhouse that bears his

468
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,036
name and boasts beef,
booze and braudz.

469
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:30,341
Broads.

470
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,811
Who was nice and who was
less fun to have...

471
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,245
The truth of the matter is,

472
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,413
all my clients were nice to me

473
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,949
because I kept them
out of prison.

474
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,685
Did alleged mob guys
know how to eat?

475
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,753
My mother used to say
two things, she said.

476
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,054
She was the greatest lady.

477
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,389
She said Oscar's clients don't

478
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,158
hurt anybody, they
just kill each other.

479
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,761
And she also said Oscar's
clients take us to the best

480
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,530
restaurants.

481
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,498
They knew where to go.

482
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:54,666
They knew where to go.

483
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,034
Yeah.

484
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:57,268
And were always treated right.

485
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,105
They were always treated
like kings and queens.

486
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,873
Did the feds hold
it against you?

487
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:02,742
You were just doing your job.

488
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:03,942
They didn't see it that way.

489
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,813
They thought I was
a consigliere.

490
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:08,447
In order to murder somebody,

491
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,516
they had to get my permission.

492
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:13,084
That's how stupid
these people were.

493
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,521
These were gentlemen not
unknown to mayor Goodman.

494
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:18,356
A lot of people tell you

495
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,726
there's a better place when
the mob was running it.

496
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:21,528
In many ways, that's true.

497
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,762
There were rules
then that mattered.

498
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,396
You know the old saying, what

499
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,098
happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

500
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,601
Back when the mob ran things,

501
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:34,039
there was a certain urgency
to that suggestion.

502
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,908
Talking about with prince

503
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,277
Harry, that's a perfect example.

504
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:41,379
Here's a guy who was
here having a good time.

505
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,448
In the old Vegas, that
would never have happened.

506
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,416
There would never have
been a disclosure.

507
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,318
In today's modern age it was all

508
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:47,854
over the world in moments.

509
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:48,154
Moments.

510
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,921
Yes.

511
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,422
It says something about the

512
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,826
town that his honor served
three terms as mayor.

513
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:59,798
He's unabashed booster,
entrepreneur, drinker of hard

514
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,166
liquor and gambler and he was

515
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:05,436
never shy about admitting it.

516
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,005
It's unique.

517
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,074
It's its own hothouse
environment.

518
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,977
Vegas is unique.

519
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:15,080
But I'll tell you one thing, you

520
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,783
go to the airport,
everybody is smiling.

521
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:20,351
They can't wait to lose their

522
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,820
money and afterwards
they're smiling.

523
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:26,024
It's a special place where
people can take their basest

524
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:26,993
instincts and just let it fly.

525
00:25:26,994 --> 00:25:28,426
I think that's good.

526
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:36,427
I have no problem
with that at all.

527
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,839
When you come to
Vegas, you see this.

528
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,543
The lights and smoke and
mirrors, the casino floors.

529
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,478
But who manages the machine?

530
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,547
Where did they come from?

531
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,051
Beneath the floors, behind
the walls, above the winking

532
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,854
surveillance camera lenses, a

533
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:58,724
whole other world manned by
thousands and thousands of

534
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,792
waiters, maintenance people,

535
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:06,031
repairmen, chefs,
engineers, plumbers.

536
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,566
Three shifts a day they slip in

537
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,902
and out of the casinos almost
unseen through their own

538
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,237
entrances but it's these people

539
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,706
who have seen it all, seen

540
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:20,545
everything, night after night.

541
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:21,913
Kenny has been working here

542
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,850
since Caesar's opened
in August of 1966.

543
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:27,686
He's dealt cards to everybody.

544
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:33,358
I've dealt to Diana Ross,
Harry Belafonte, Sinatra.

545
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,426
Sinatra was not supposed to

546
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,428
be particularly
amiable at the table.

547
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,264
Sinatra was class.

548
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:38,898
Really?

549
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:39,832
He was class.

550
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,266
He was a gentleman.

551
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,600
But those were the good days.

552
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:48,373
But it's nice now, too.

553
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:54,545
Would you describe yourself
as a degenerate gambler?

554
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,282
I'm trying to move past that.

555
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,449
We have a 2-year-old at home.

556
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,619
But I'll always have that
gambling gear, no doubt about

557
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:01,788
it.

558
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:04,856
Eric and Erica are
professional gamblers, poker

559
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:05,692
players, to be precise.

560
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:06,892
It's routine for them to sit

561
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,126
down to a game with a bankroll

562
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,062
of half a million dollars.

563
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:14,900
Tonight, slightly
smaller stakes.

564
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,401
Hey, how do you like my chances?

565
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:16,635
Good.

566
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:20,305
Good.

567
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,707
That's a trained answer.

568
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,641
Instead of actual poker, we

569
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,443
are set up with a dumbed down

570
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,645
for the camera version
of Texas hold 'em.

571
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,780
You play against the house.

572
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:32,117
The odds, to say the least,
are stacked against you.

573
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:33,819
Oh, here's a winner.

574
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,220
Here's a winner.

575
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:37,889
Two pair.

576
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,457
He's cutting up over there.

577
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,726
See how easy it is?

578
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:43,461
You got this game down.

579
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:43,996
Uh-oh.

580
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:46,898
Those are famous last words.

581
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:47,767
All right.

582
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:50,568
Let's put out a hundred
dollars, see what happens.

583
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,070
All right.

584
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,303
Now we have a pair of 7s.

585
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:52,705
I want to bet.

586
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:55,273
Okay.

587
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:58,309
I have trips.

588
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,746
That's going to be
pretty hard to beat.

589
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:02,948
You're a dead man, Benny.

590
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:03,816
I'm a dead man.

591
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:04,416
I'll bet again.

592
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,151
Okay.

593
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:06,418
Two pair.

594
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,518
Pair of deuces.

595
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,587
Two pair.

596
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:12,958
Pair of 10s.

597
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:13,292
Oh, no.

598
00:28:13,293 --> 00:28:14,293
Pair of kings.

599
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:19,130
Benny!

600
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,165
Goodness, Benny.

601
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,800
Huh?

602
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:22,301
You got a full house.

603
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:26,304
This is unbelievable.

604
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,606
Is there a cooler
standing behind us?

605
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:29,141
All right.

606
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:29,976
That works for me.

607
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:30,542
Thank you very much.

608
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:34,645
This is what we call a learning
experience in my case.

609
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,547
That was fun.

610
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,515
We got away with our shirts.

611
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:37,383
Let's not do it again.

612
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,651
Let's never do it again.

613
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,570
It's easy to find people
that will help you but

614
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,339
somebody's got to be the one to

615
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,544
create the mess in
the first place.

616
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:10,481
Where's our metaphor here?

617
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:10,983
Untangle this.

618
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:12,918
This is going to be so much fun.

619
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,485
Anthony Bondi is an artist

620
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,555
and a born and bred
Las Vegas native.

621
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,190
After many adventures and I'm

622
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,859
guessing some misadventures as

623
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,562
well, he chose to live here.

624
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,364
To what degree am I complicit

625
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,900
in the worst of our city by

626
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:34,072
making art that
glorifies the city?

627
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:36,608
I don't profit directly from
what those people do but of

629
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,877
course, I do, because I live in

630
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:42,780
the city and as that money
rolls all around us.

631
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,417
But how do we live with it?

632
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:52,123
It's not why and where the
people come from who do the

633
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,191
grotesque things people do here.

634
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:56,027
It's how do we live
here complicit in it.

635
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:58,229
That's the big issue to be

636
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,264
self-reflective about the place

637
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:00,465
or you have to go and stay high

638
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,700
all the time because
of the shame.

639
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,435
You know, which is another

640
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:10,541
popular way to deal
with living here.

641
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:14,479
Is Vegas a friendly town?

642
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,948
Yeah, because that's our job.

643
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,283
But I mean to itself.

644
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:19,450
You're a local.

645
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,953
No.

646
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:22,154
No.

647
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:28,559
Not a bit.

648
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
This town has never had any

649
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,796
respect for the people who
just happened to live here.

650
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:35,600
In the old day, we were
co-conspirators in those days.

651
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,568
We weren't citizens.

652
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,970
The new authority, the new power

653
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:41,406
is exactly as anonymous
as the old power.

654
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:44,475
No poll number, no access.

655
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:45,843
Though it's been for some

656
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,445
years an art community in Vegas,

657
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,646
you know, like art that makes

658
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:52,250
your life, all our lives,
better and makes us think.

659
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:55,686
Granted, Vegas is a town
designed to make you not think,

661
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,955
just separate you from your

662
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:59,524
money in as pleasurable
a way as possible.

663
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:00,825
So pleasurable that even after

664
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:04,662
you limp out of town leaking

665
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:05,631
from your... with nothing in

666
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:08,799
your pockets, you want to
come back and do it again.

667
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,168
Reflection, not so good.

668
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:14,139
As a resident, what are the
general rules of survival?

669
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,475
Don't cry about being broke.

670
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,677
If I'm broke, it's because I

671
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:20,878
threw away my money and too bad

672
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,714
for me because I
didn't get lucky.

673
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,516
Don't complain
about being broke.

674
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:25,717
Okay.

675
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,852
What's another one?

676
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,187
Well, smile.

677
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:30,721
That is absolutely
local characteristic.

678
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,190
This is a service industry town.

679
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,692
One of our roles here has

680
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,361
always been to take away excess

681
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:37,895
money from people who don't know

682
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,064
what to do with it and who can't

683
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:41,332
think of a better idea about
how to spend their money.

684
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,568
We'll always take it.

685
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:48,739
Is that worse than before?

686
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,708
The wrong is there are people

687
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:54,179
with that kind of income who
could put it to so many

688
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,713
thrilling uses and can think of

689
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:58,549
nothing so crass and boring than

690
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,387
to wave the money in the
air and throw it away.

691
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,255
How loathesome but within those

692
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,657
of us who live here
is that challenge.

693
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,126
This has always been.

694
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:10,829
Here we are.

695
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,442
You are sitting in the best

696
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,077
Thai restaurant in Vegas by far.

697
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:30,381
One of the best Thai
restaurants in America.

698
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:31,849
Jet has been here before.

699
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,351
An L.A. guy, he came out here to

700
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:34,585
do four years as executive chef

701
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:38,056
at encore, a Wynn
casino on the strip.

702
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,624
He's a reigning authority on

703
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,891
Thai food but really, everybody

704
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:44,062
who loves Thai food
knows about this place.

705
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:46,297
What you should order here
should only be northern.

706
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,299
You go to the back of the menu,

707
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,567
it's northern specialties.

708
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:50,801
You come here and eat chicken

709
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,204
with cashew nuts, I'm going
to punch you in the face.

710
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:56,941
Right.

711
00:32:56,942 --> 00:33:00,578
Sipend is the owner and chef.

712
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:01,213
Now get this.

713
00:33:01,214 --> 00:33:03,114
And it's important.

714
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,749
You don't do pad Thai here.

715
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,951
You do what they are uniquely

716
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,054
superb at which is specifically

717
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:13,791
the food of northern Thailand.

718
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:20,598
♪

719
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,900
Oh, yeah, yeah, of
course, love it.

720
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:24,469
Chili dip.

721
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,838
It's really more of like a

722
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,776
composed room temperature salad.

723
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:34,612
This is a puffed crispy rice
salad with preserved pork

724
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:34,846
sausage.

725
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:38,849
That's good.

726
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,151
Jackfruit salad.

727
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,620
Jackfruit salad.

728
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,590
This is a pork curry braised

729
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:48,359
down with garlic and ginger.

730
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,927
This pork is amazing.

731
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:50,961
Isn't that great?

732
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:51,663
And that's northern love.

733
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:51,963
Right.

734
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:53,964
Very important dish.

735
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:58,536
Oh, that looks really pretty.

736
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,839
This is the food
my grandma made.

737
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,343
That's perfection, man.

738
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,945
What I love about Vegas Asian

739
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:10,215
food is on one street you have

740
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,150
the best Cantonese food, you

741
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:13,684
drive down the street and
get the best Thai food.

742
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:18,323
How did that happen?

743
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:19,191
Gambling.

744
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:25,029
But I mean, were there high
rollers who would come into

745
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,133
town... a dude
with a $10 million

746
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,834
credit line that wins will go

747
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:31,569
eat a $10 Chinese meal because

748
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,038
it's the closest thing
he has to home food.

749
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,706
I'm going to eat Asian food,

750
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,747
come back and drop $5 million
more and then go home.

751
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,856
This is what avant gard cooking

752
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,023
is. People think that we want

753
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,125
to do things in a way
because we want to be cool.

754
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,826
No.

755
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,828
We do it because really, we

756
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,096
believe we are increasing the

757
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,399
value of the product
we are working with.

758
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:09,400
We are giving you the essence.

759
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:16,847
Tonight, tucked away in the
back of another of Jose's

760
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,849
restaurants, behind the guys

761
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,219
making paieia over a flame in

762
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,889
the center of a
crowded dining room.

763
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,357
Quiet, serene, a kind of magic.

764
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,125
This is granted a far cry from

765
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,195
the $1 shrimp cocktail and the

766
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:33,364
all you can eat buffets groaning

767
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:37,535
under the weight of
a thousand carbs.

768
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:42,207
Ham and bean soup with
black and roasted garlic.

769
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:47,445
The world's best,
like from Spain.

770
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,214
Nitro almond cup, a frozen shell

771
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:51,882
made from a puree of almonds,

772
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:56,821
filled with almond milk espuma
and finished with caviar.

774
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,924
You know, chef, this meal
is working very well.

775
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,960
My palate is open, I'm
intrigued, I'm only growing more

776
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:03,595
hungry and excited.

777
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:05,663
The desired effect
is taking hold.

778
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:11,402
If you were a famous chef and

779
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,103
you are lured as so many are to

780
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:13,805
rivers of green promised by

781
00:36:13,806 --> 00:36:19,076
Vegas, it's nice if you can
get yourself a playroom.

782
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:27,077
Gentlemen, this is foam.

783
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,459
He doesn't say air.

784
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:40,531
Water is not water anymore.

785
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:48,532
Water has a body, belongs.

786
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:52,943
The truffle egg, truffles

787
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,379
formed into an egg shape with an

788
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:59,450
actual yolk suspended
in the center.

789
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:05,290
I think we will be feeding
our kichickens truffles.

790
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:12,630
Served with onion puree, and

791
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,632
finished with more
shaved white truffle.

792
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:18,168
This is crispy chicken skin.

793
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:23,974
Sliding this off
right into my face.

794
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,076
This is your portion and

795
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,414
Brian is going to come finish it

796
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:33,551
with a Clementine sauce for you.

797
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:41,025
Gentlemen, this is
your next course.

798
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:47,765
Awesome.

799
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:54,572
It's a secret cut.

800
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:57,508
You know the work that goes

801
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:05,509
into creating a dish like this?

802
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,719
They say the chef was not there.

803
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,355
Then look at the food critics

804
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:13,257
saying it's almost like
a lack of respect.

805
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:16,193
Who do you think
these people are?

806
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:23,033
Where do you think
they come from?

807
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,971
Everyone one of those amazing

808
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,706
sous chefs we have, they are as

809
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,775
good, if not better, than the

810
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:37,148
guys that have the big name
on top with neon letter.

811
00:38:52,798 --> 00:39:00,798
There is not an acre of
preserved Mojave desert in the

812
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:04,142
city limbs of Las Vegas.

813
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:04,776
Why would you preserve this?

814
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:07,778
This desolation
is not nurturing.

815
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:08,979
We can't be here unless there's

816
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,982
a lot of technology
supporting our presence.

817
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:17,021
And so there's a sense of
the city versus nature.

818
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,156
This is not our friend.

819
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,290
You would think looking at

820
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,326
the vast lake, the canals, the

821
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,495
fountains of Vegas in the middle

822
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:26,196
of a desert, the flush of

823
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,832
100,000 toilets and the casinos

824
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,034
and what they bring would

825
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:34,872
constitute an obscene
waste of water.

826
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:44,181
And indeed water is at a
desperate premium as water

828
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:45,950
levels decrease at
an alarming rate.

829
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:49,153
But it isn't the casinos
that are the culprits.

830
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,889
In fact, Vegas casinos are a

831
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,658
model of water efficiency
and conservation.

832
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:56,160
Main culprit?

833
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:59,129
All-American lawn.

834
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,198
A little square of green.

835
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,534
Robert Kern is water police.

836
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:06,136
He patrols the Vegas streets

837
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:09,874
looking for evidence
of water violations.

838
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:13,511
Saw some water in the
gutter on both sides.

839
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:15,546
This is not their day.

840
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,314
We're in an area where there

841
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,684
shouldn't be any water,
yet there's water here.

842
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,887
That's what we do, we drive
around looking for something

844
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:23,921
like that, to give them
a little education.

845
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,223
Hey, you're not supposed
to water today.

846
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:28,058
So you don't wrestle them to

847
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,560
the ground, cuff
them and drag them?

848
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:32,162
No, we do not.

849
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,064
Although we have a fee.

850
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:33,732
How much?

851
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:35,065
$80.

852
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:39,037
Then it doubles.

853
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:41,507
It.

854
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:46,577
It seems a losing battle
to keep your grass green.

855
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:49,013
Most everyone came from the

856
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:51,448
east coast and everything
was lush and green.

857
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,417
That's what Vegas
was 20 years ago.

858
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,720
The city assigns watering

859
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:58,756
days to control useage, and also

860
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,424
encourages a landscaping style

861
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:02,627
focused on drought-resistant

862
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:03,861
plants and efficient irrigation.

863
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:06,096
And if you don't get with the

864
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,933
program, there's a hole out
there in the desert for you.

866
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:09,901
Okay, not really.

867
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:12,236
You get a notice pinned to
your door or something.

868
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:13,470
But some people want the lawn?

869
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,606
Got to have it.

870
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,041
They can have it, just don't
water on the wrong days.

871
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,208
How critical is it?

872
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:18,777
Very.

873
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:20,144
I mean, there's no snow on the

874
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,647
western sierras, so we don't get

875
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,214
any continued flow into the

876
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:29,119
Colorado dumping into lake mead.

877
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,490
Unless something drastically
changes in the near future.

879
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:41,491
But got to stay positive.

880
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,137
For the first 30, 40 year,

881
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:51,408
you just couldn't conceive
of what was ahead.

882
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,110
What we had, whatever was the

883
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:55,312
newest thing that was happening

884
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,081
was so spectacular and wonderful

885
00:41:56,082 --> 00:41:57,915
and oh, my gosh, we reached a

886
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,651
new eastern edge, a western
edge, a northern edge.

887
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:02,753
The odds are slim to zero that

888
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:07,958
we're going to extend it to
yet an even further horizon.

890
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:08,860
It was unconceivable.

891
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,828
So there's the thing.

892
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,631
The desert exceeds our ambition.

893
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:16,834
In Vegas, nothing is permanent.

894
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:21,505
It constantly eats itself, tears

895
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:24,541
down, builds up, expands

896
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:28,512
according to no known or
easily understood plan.

897
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,014
An organic thing responding to

898
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:35,686
the dark dreams of the
American sub conscious.

899
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:38,322
Come frolic, live like Caesar,

900
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:40,858
or make money off those who do.

901
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,361
Drop a few moist bills
in a gas station slot.

902
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,296
See the full spectrum of human

903
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:53,104
folly and commit some
follies of your own.
