1
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:04,296
I feel completely distraught.

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,047
I didn't think we'd
go through with it.

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,549
Now it's a lot of uncertainty.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,926
It's a shock.

5
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,761
We're all in deep shit.

6
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,930
Better the devil you
know, than you don't.

7
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:14,139
It goes on.

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,266
I feel it's like the
end of the world.

9
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,518
It feels pretty bad.

10
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,060
It's the ramifications
of it all.

11
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,729
There doesn't seem
to be a plan for

12
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,982
what we're going to do now.

13
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,694
You don't know what to do,
because they're all arguing.

14
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:31,762
It little woken them, but...
I think human beings

15
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:36,036
are still stupid and
ego gets in the way.

I believe some things to be
true about England, other than

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,047
that I know I can always
find friends there.

30
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,374
It's where you can
find some of the best

31
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,591
restaurants in Europe.

32
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:31,800
It's beautiful.

33
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,762
It's... I don't know...
Sophisticated.

34
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,888
They're old.

35
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:36,972
They've been around.

36
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,746
But on this last trip,
unexpectedly, the mood in London

37
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:44,145
became darker, more
uncertain about the future.

38
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,147
The British people
spoke last night.

39
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,295
Brutal wake-up call.

40
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:50,151
It turns out that it
was about immigration,

41
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,529
that more than half of
Britain's immigration

42
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,948
comes from outside the EU.

43
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,156
It's a disaster, a calamity.

44
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,639
The young are very, very
angry about what's happened

45
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,204
and the gamble that's being
taken with their future.

46
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,585
Few in London, anyway, went to
sleep thinking that England

47
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:07,962
would leave the European Union.

48
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,213
That was for the rubes, the
people from the sticks,

49
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,758
the country people,
old, white people,

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,429
people who felt pushed out,
neglected, disenfranchised

51
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,557
by the new, the young, the
foreign, the decidedly

52
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:21,642
less-white England of today.

53
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,311
The votes were tallied,
and the majority

54
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,604
had decided to Brexit.

♪ And the RAF of England ♪

56
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,151
The ramifications were unclear,
but the financial markets

57
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:34,696
plummeted, the nation's
credit rating was downgraded,

58
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:38,575
the prime minister resigned,
and both political parties'

59
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:41,870
leadership basically
disintegrated overnight.

61
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,798
In uncertain times, I always

and the familiar, the
things that always, for me,

63
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,658
made England great,
like one of my favorite

64
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,307
restaurants on Earth,
and one of the chefs

65
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:02,516
I like and respect most.

66
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,227
This restaurant helped
make a persuasive argument

67
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,981
that there is some kind of
merit -to British cooking.

68
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,733
Yes.

69
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,234
It's absolutely true.

70
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,113
Fergus Henderson, the
most influential chef

71
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,886
of the last two decades,
even though you have likely

72
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:20,241
never heard of him.

73
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,243
He changed everything.

74
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,622
It seems an instinctive
thing to cook old-school,

75
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:27,248
simple, proud, English
country cooking.

76
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,169
But it started a
quiet revolution.

77
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:36,257
St. John, I love you and I
need you now more than ever.

78
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,259
It's about the single
ingredient on the plate,

79
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,262
speaking for itself in that
classic Italian sort of way.

80
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,431
And so you can get lost.

81
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,727
Roast bone marrow with
parsley and caper salad,

82
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,311
sourdough bread made here.

83
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,481
A dish that would become
absolutely iconic.

84
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,109
If you've ever eaten
bone marrow anywhere,

85
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,278
it's very likely because
they did it here first.

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,075
My dinner companion is food
critic and author Jay Rayner,

87
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,785
a man never with a
shortage of opinions.

88
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,704
Bones.

89
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,581
Thank you, yes.

90
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,290
Salt.

91
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,211
And there you go It's
a simple, good thing,

92
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,171
but it's one of the most
influential dishes,

93
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,714
like, in the last 20 years.

94
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,882
It's a good thing.

95
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,551
You see his imprint everywhere.

96
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,281
It's true.

97
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:22,763
And what's interesting
is that the aesthetic

98
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,681
gets passed down in other
ways that you don't expect.

99
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,183
Yeah.

100
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,809
As I've become
older, I've noticed

101
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,333
the food that I yearn for
is food that I react to

102
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,314
in an entirely emotional way.

103
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,610
The problem is that it's
so very, very rare.

104
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:41,280
I'm looking for a suspension...
No-

105
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,324
-...of logic and reason.

106
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,746
This is something that I got
here from the beginning.

107
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,395
Pickled calves tripe with
radish, shaved carrot,

108
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,541
and watercress.

109
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,105
Lovely.

110
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:52,626
Wow.

111
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,398
Wow.

112
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,128
Thank you.

113
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,538
There are some tripe
dishes that are just

114
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,755
uniquely wonderful.

115
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:57,965
And it's a tricky ingredient.

116
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,341
Once you're cooking it,
it smells like wet dog.

117
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,928
The way we smell things and
taste them is very different.

118
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,096
All the best foods stink.

119
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,222
Yeah.

120
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,057
And it's an extraordinary thing.

121
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:10,351
These foods, there's a faint
whiff of death about them,

122
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,854
are the ones that remind you
that you're the most alive.

123
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,023
The scent of your own mortality.

124
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,357
Of your own mortality.

125
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,029
Skate poached in court bouillon,
with fennel in green sauce

126
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,364
of fresh parsley,
herbs, and anchovies.

127
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,428
Hmm.

128
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:25,450
It's nice.

129
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,476
Savory treats -in
the form of kidney.

130
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:31,748
Oh, the little kidneys.

131
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,374
They're so pretty.

132
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,669
And how were these
kidneys done, sir?

133
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,839
Well, seasoned fair... Nice.

134
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,260
And then put sauce...
P'shh, p'shh!

135
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,970
Sizzling.

136
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,849
Chicken stock...
Butter, p'shh, p'shh.

137
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,977
P'shh, shh, and toast.

138
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,687
Done.

139
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,855
Yes, thank you.

140
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,190
Good, wow.

141
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,315
Eat well.

142
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,399
Thank you.

143
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,994
Pig's head and potato pie.

144
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,913
The head brined, slowly
simmered until tender,

145
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,146
stripped away from the bone,
and seasoned then baked

146
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:16,835
in pastry with potatoes.

147
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,795
Yes, please.

148
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,131
A traditional dish
that exemplifies

149
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,841
everything I believe in.

150
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,654
Wow.

151
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:24,425
Nice.

152
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,447
Thank you, sir.

153
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:26,427
Thank you.

154
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,971
All right.

155
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,266
Oh, look at that.

156
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,371
Great joy.

157
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:33,434
That's working.

158
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,145
Is this a hot water pastry?

159
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,169
So, it's a puff pastry, but
somehow transfers of fats

160
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,963
through the pig's head out
and the [indistinct] in

161
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:43,465
makes it so the crust...
It's gorgeous.

162
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:44,445
Indeed.

163
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,697
Oh, God, that's good.

164
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,032
Extraordinary.

165
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,868
You look at this pie, and it's
almost like something out

166
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,868
of a children's book.

167
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,702
Right.

168
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,913
The pie tradition is
something very, very special.

169
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,040
If you go back in history
to the Hogarth painting,

170
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,271
"The Roast Beef of Old England"...
Yup.

171
00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:59,460
...you'll realize that
actually we were far ahead

172
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,963
of the French in the
preparation of beef

173
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,963
and the roasting of meats.

174
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,258
A lot of it was over our
side of the channel.

175
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,383
Yeah.

176
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,345
Which is no reason for
leaving the European Union.

177
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,141
So they call it Great Britain.

178
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,935
What's great about Britain?

179
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:20,148
I can refer to a certain literacy
and a wry sense of humor,

180
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,152
and a political tradition of
democracy, which, ironically,

181
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:27,530
the referendum that's caused
so many of us so much pain

182
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,074
is a perfect example of.

183
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,493
Also, a weirdly cosmopolitan,
welcoming environment

184
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,748
in which the history of
immigration into the country

185
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,126
has defined a far
more open culture.

186
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,921
Until this point I was very,
very proud, but that...

187
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:43,671
I wouldn't be here.

188
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,791
You know, my great-great
grandparents

189
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,217
arrived as shtetl Jews off
the boat into the East End

190
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,510
of London, and here I
am still to this day,

191
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,512
and that's a very,
very important thing.

192
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,223
A very tolerant country.

193
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,933
This is a very traumatic moment.

194
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,768
Will it all work out in the end?

195
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,894
I have no idea.

196
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,055
- Wow.
- It's the honest truth.

197
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,522
Nothing is certain.

198
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,942
♪

199
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,447
You know what I like?
A good pub.

200
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,158
Like the Princess
Victoria in West London,

201
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,160
and stuff like this.

202
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,744
Did you like pork scratchings?

203
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,788
I do.

204
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,581
Hmm. Cheers.

205
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,585
Oh, that's insanely good.

206
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,543
Maybe you wouldn't think that
the legendary cookbook author

207
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,610
Nigella Lawson and I could
be friends, but we are.

208
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,133
We are, admittedly,
very different.

209
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,386
She is the very definition of
kindness, elegance, grace,

210
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,554
the woman who taught
England to cook.

211
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,555
Nice.

212
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,016
What do you get here ordinarily?

213
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:36,725
Scotch egg.

214
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:37,392
All right.

215
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,769
Scotch eggs, please,
and some whitebait.

216
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:40,646
Certainly.

217
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:41,480
And some chips.

218
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,475
Whitebait? This is, like, the
greatest thing ever. Really?

219
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,233
Oh, yeah. Whitebait
is so good, isn't it?

220
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,943
In a little pub, you
can get whitebait?

221
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,468
Well, I'm sure in Charles
Dickens' time, they used to have

222
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:51,281
whitebait then.

223
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,574
Mind you, then, they used
to have oysters too, so...

224
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,160
I can't hear you
over the crunching.

225
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,696
I can't hear myself over
the crunch, actually.

226
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,664
I'll be... I lost interest
in what I was saying.

227
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,460
Whitebait, tiny baby herring
lightly battered whole

228
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,004
and fried, tossed
with a little bit

229
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:08,673
of lemon juice and salt,
the perfect bar food.

230
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,091
There's this
slightly crisp, huh?

231
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:10,842
Hmm.

232
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,302
Do you have this in the States?

233
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,179
You're starting to see
them, but almost never.

234
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,638
Beautiful, though, aren't they?

235
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,598
And fat chips, always important.

236
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,600
What is the appropriate
condiment with chips?

237
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,603
Being old-fashioned, I
think vinegar and salt.

238
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,524
If I'm in Brussels or Holland,
I'm fine about mayonnaise,

239
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,934
- but if it's here...
- Oh [indistinct] there,

240
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,276
- I'm with you there.
- Yeah.

241
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,404
And what is it, chips
with curry sauce?

242
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,447
Hmm, fantastic. Sorry.

243
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,909
It's really a matter of how
many Guinnesses you've had.

244
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,619
A soft-boiled egg, wrap
it in minced pork,

245
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,622
then roll it in bread crumbs, and what?
Deep-fry it?

246
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,710
It's like a supernova of
unhealthiness and deliciousness.

247
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,255
This is the important thing,
the softness of the yolk.

248
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,630
Right. Who invented this?

249
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,007
It's just fiendish.

250
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,877
One of the explanations,
Scotch used to preserve eggs

251
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,344
and send them to England.

252
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,172
What would happen is that
they would [indistinct]

253
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,349
Some sort of lime on them,
and it would discolor them,

254
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,518
so they then covered
them to hide that.

255
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,311
This is just right.

256
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,065
When I grew up, they were
very low-rent, very cheap,

257
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,943
rather spooky sausage
meat, rock-hard egg,

258
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,863
that sort of tinge like,
you know, -Uranus.

259
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:13,364
Right.

260
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,741
Uranus, as they prefer to
call it now because they get

261
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:16,533
embarrassed.

262
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,119
And then deep-fried into those
cheap red bread crumbs.

263
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,912
And then it got rehabilitated.

264
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,123
Very good eggs, very
good pork meat.

265
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,665
All your basic food groups.

266
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,785
- Hmm.
- These are really good.

267
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,918
Hmm, really good.

268
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,379
Salt and fat, nothing better.

269
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,089
Oh, yeah.

270
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,592
This is nice.

271
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,926
It is nice, strangely calm.

272
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,596
It is an argument from England.

273
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,158
Really?

274
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,679
Yeah.

275
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,681
- If you have a good pub...
- Yes.

276
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,517
...and if you're
gonna have a pint,

277
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,511
this is the perfect time.

278
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,602
It's quiet.

279
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,686
It is.

280
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,689
We can pretend all is
right with the universe.

281
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,774
I'm going to pretend.

282
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,703
England, as the
anti-Brexit forces

283
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,873
found out to their
dismay, ain't London.

284
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,231
It's different out
there and a lot of it

285
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:11,087
is very, very beautiful.

286
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,756
As we get older, we
start to look backwards

287
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,384
in our life and reflect.

288
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,719
When we're young, we
only look forward,

289
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,929
we don't think of our past.

290
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,141
Our past has such a small value.

291
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,811
I'm of an age now,
we become nostalgic,

292
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,357
we become philosophical.

293
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,589
One can, if a successful gentleman
of many accomplishments,

294
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,737
for instance, with a little
bit of money to spend,

295
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,595
make, as Emerson
advised, your own world

296
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:40,908
far from the madness.

297
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,746
We're in North Wiltshire, and
there's Bath in the distance.

298
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,123
It's really beautiful.

299
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,543
Oh, yeah, nice view.

300
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,129
You'll see how it
just drifts away.

301
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,756
So that's about five
miles as the crow flies.

302
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,469
There are few chefs who set
the world of chefs aflame

303
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,761
like Marco Pierre White.

304
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,473
As young cooks, looking
at his incredible rise

305
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,684
from working-class
boy to the youngest

306
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:08,936
three-Michelin-starred chef in
the world, we were inspired,

307
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,481
not just by his
accomplishments and his food,

308
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,296
which were amazing, no
great chef had ever

309
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:17,028
looked like him before
or talked like him.

310
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,573
We were not, it appeared, alone.

311
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,867
I want to turn Rudloe into a house...
Uhhmm.

312
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:26,871
...not a hotel, so when you
walk inside, it's personal.

313
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,789
Once obsessed with
nothing but working

314
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,522
the hardest, the
longest, being the best,

315
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:33,878
Marco has transferred
his obsessive nature

316
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,173
to the more pleasurable task
of making the Rudloe Arms

317
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,883
his perfect place.

318
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,802
What's important
about a restaurant

319
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,723
is the feel, not a look.

320
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,726
You could go to the best
restaurant in the world tomorrow.

321
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,928
They could serve the best food.

322
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,812
But if you don't feel comfortable
within that environment,

323
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,314
you'll never enjoy it.

324
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:58,528
Inside is as much a project
as the grounds, every detail.

325
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,656
Then you can be yourself.

326
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,324
Number one, environment.

327
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,825
Number two, service.

328
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,369
Number three, food.

329
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:12,125
A pan-roasted filet of
beef with escargot.

330
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,336
Whoa. It's beautiful.

331
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,837
Who do you want to come here?

332
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,715
People who enjoy themselves.

333
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:19,840
I like a mixed demographic.

334
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,301
- I wanna have everybody.
- Uh-hmm.

335
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,844
I don't want to just
target one market.

336
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,930
Food should be affordable.

337
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,101
Very, very good.

338
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,730
Has your food always reflected
your aspirations and dreams

339
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,148
rather than where you came from?

340
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,234
I was born and bred on the
outskirts of Leeds in a project

341
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:38,859
housing estate.

342
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,780
Even though I was born into
very humble beginnings,

343
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,865
I used to cross my road,
walk over the golf course,

344
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,744
and there I was on the
Harewood Estates,

345
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:51,018
designed by the great Capability
Brown, the stately home

346
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:52,123
of the Earl of Harewood.

347
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,083
That was my playground.

348
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,505
I was fascinated by
the countryside.

349
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,362
I loved the rivers, the
streams, the brooks,

350
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:02,300
the fields, the woods.

351
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,721
What was within them,
that's what captured me.

352
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,765
It was a dream.

353
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,892
That was my escapism.

354
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,186
My mother died when I was six.

355
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,731
Mother Nature, she became
my surrogate mother.

356
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,899
And so, therefore, I
have this amazing

357
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,320
love affair with nature.

358
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,322
But look, once you go into
a high-end restaurant,

359
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,429
you're about as far as
from nature as you can be.

360
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,910
I mean, it's hard to
rise up the ranks

361
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,914
of a good fine-dining restaurant,
particularly in the time

362
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,499
that you came up.

363
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,916
Shit was not easy.

364
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,401
Everybody in the kitchen
that I started in came from

365
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:41,840
a housing project.

366
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,923
They were working-class.

367
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,924
They were tough.

368
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,010
They were hard, really hard.

369
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,429
The flip side of that coin...

370
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,058
was nature.

371
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:57,480
It was all those beautiful
ingredients, that beautiful

372
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,981
contradiction.

373
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,238
Come see my family.

374
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,034
Piggies! Come on,
piggy, piggy, piggies.

375

Holy crap.

Piggies! What do you think?

378
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,283
They seemed very well-groomed.

Piggies, what do you think about
our friends from America?

383
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,342
- Yeah.
- What breed of pig are these?

384
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,968
These are Oxford
Sandy and Black.

385
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,846
They're a traditional
Wiltshire pig.

386
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,891
In four months, this is
how big they've got.

387
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,851
Wow.

388
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,977
They remember your
voice and your smell.

389
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,063
They're really,
really affectionate.

390
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,981
Naturally, they're woodland.

391
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,067
Indeed, beautiful.

392
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,819
It's almost
self-sustaining here.

393
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,863
Well, we will be for
a bacon [indistinct]

The legendary classic on

401
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,010
an homage to another
great chef and mentor.

402
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,012
It is perfection.

403
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,599
Oh, my God, that is beautiful.

404
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,539
When I was a young cook, we
would look at photographs

of this dish, my
comrades and colleagues,

406
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,441
and gape at it with wonder.

407
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,026
First we'd say, "Oh, my
God, that's gorgeous,"

408
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,111
and, "How did he do it?"

409
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,029
It just got all of
the textural things

410
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,031
that every great cuisine
around the world

411
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,952
understands to be, "Wow."

412
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,851
Pig's trotter has got 24
bones, so you have to remove

413
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:37,747
all those bones.

414
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,707
And then you braise
it for four hours.

415
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,896
Right.

416
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:42,042
It's very simple.

417

I know. This is

Yes.

It's just one of those
great creations.

531
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:08,559
doubling up.

532
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,520
The drinking starts to
accelerate in a mad panic.

533
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,356
Load as many in.

534
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,316
Do you think if you extend
the drinking hours,

535
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,903
that it would improve
behavior or make it worse?

536
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,320
I mean, let's face it.

537
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,573
Your countrymen have a bad
reputation as far as...

538
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,178
Drinking.

539
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:25,034
...sensible... yeah,
sensible drinking.

540
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,996
Do you think that's a function of...
Whatever.

541
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,587
♪

542
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,760
You know, when I was 14,
15, "Fear and Loathing"

543
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,220
came out in Rolling Stone.

544
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,346
I think it was the artwork first

545
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,559
that spoke to me in a
really transformative way.

546
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:54,354
♪

547
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,817
It captured perfectly all of
my rage, all of the absurdity,

548
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,359
all of these things
that I didn't think

549
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,403
anybody else was seeing or responding to...
Yeah.

550
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,362
...in the same way.

551
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,991
It was unlike anything I'd seen.

552
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:09,891
Artist, author, icon, Ralph
Steadman, continues to make art

553
00:22:09,892 --> 00:22:11,371
every day.

554
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,271
He was the visual expression of Dr.
Hunter S. Thompson's

555
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,417
finest works.

556
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,711
When Hunter came, 1991,
1992, I brought him

557
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,173
down to the pub here.

558
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,196
"Oh, Martin, this is Hunter."

559
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:24,177
"Hello."

560
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:28,222
Here would be Ralph's local,
The Chequers Inn in Kent.

561
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,556
"Hunter, what do you like?"

562
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,891
"Chivas Regal, please."

563
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,312
So I said, "Okay, Martin,
could you make [indistinct]"

564
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:35,313
That a double?"

565
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,398
Well, these optics, you know,
they've got nothing in them.

566
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,776
They're tiny, little
chiclet-size, yeah.

567
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,864
So did that twice with it, put
it down in front of Hunter.

568
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,366
Hunter looked at it and he
said, "What's that, a sample?"

569
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,414
Where are you from originally?

570
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,415
Well, I am Welsh.

571
00:22:55,457 --> 00:23:00,587
My mother, she was Gwenny
Rogers from Rhosllanerchrugog.

572
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,422
Uh-huh, don't ask
me to spell that.

573
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,675
No, I can't even do it myself.

574
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,303
So how English do you feel,
given that you grew up

575
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,303
in Wales?

576
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:11,849
Well, in a way, you know, it
was not far from Liverpool.

577
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,186
The food is pub fare, a
runny egg wrapped in

578
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:19,023
Parma ham and breadcrumbs,
prawn cocktail for the man.

579
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,943
I think, it was the Scanlan's
article the first you worked

580
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:22,818
with Hunter Thompson?

581
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,799
Kentucky Derby?

582
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,737
Yeah.

583
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,240
Wait, before that, would
you say that you were

584
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:30,076
a respectable figure, making
a living doing your work?

585
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,975
Because you kind of were
transformed very quickly into a

586
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:35,539
counter-cultural figure.

587
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,167
I think a lot of people
will, appropriately or not,

588
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,543
see you as an outlaw artist.

589
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,255
Yeah, but I didn't start off
wanting to be an artist.

590
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,840
I wanted to be an
aircraft engineer.

591
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,843
I didn't like factory life,
but I had to go every week

592
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,867
to do technical drawing,
and that's where the lines

593
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:52,556
and circles began.

594
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,308
Right.

595
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,166
I've been doing a book
called "Critical Critters:"

596
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,773
The Beastly Sneers and Callous
Observations by Ceri Levy."

597
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,108
He's writing about the thing.

598
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,525
Articulated bum lice?

599
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,485
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

600
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,447
I don't know whether
they exist, but... Well,

601
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,490
I'm pretty sure they do...
What?

602
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,490
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they do.

603
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,221
Really?

604
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:13,493
Some sort... there's
definitely bum-seeking insects

605
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,329
that I've encountered,
they [indistinct]

606
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,331
He thinks that I'm obsessed
with things to do with,

607
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,792
you know, lavatorial humor.

608
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,501
That's kind of an English thing.

609
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,920
Is it?

610
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,027
I saw an advert, "You,
too, can learn to draw"

611
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:27,507
and earn pounds."

612
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,594
I took the course while I
was doing military service.

613
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,431
I was drawing the guys in
the billet playing cards,

614
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,599
blankets on the bed,
boots in the bed.

615
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,017
Very simplistic stuff.

616
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,145
Nevertheless, it got me started.

617
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,771
And have you heard
of an echidna?

618
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,022
I have not.

619
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,108
This is a hedgehog
type of creature.

620
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,776
There aren't many of
these left, you know.

621
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,320
They reach critical stages.

622
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,905
And this is going in,
too, 'cause, "Excuse me",

623
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:53,242
we're collecting from
endangered species."

624
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,122
We can all learn
to do this first.

625
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,540
- Not this...
- Right.

626
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,500
But this.

627
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,692
That is very difficult.

628
00:25:05,693 --> 00:25:07,756
I don't think I can do that.

629
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,216
I'm quite sure I can't.

630
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,135
My basic motor skills
are not so good.

631
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,552
Here, you got fish and chips.

632
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,138
Oh, blimey.

633
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,639
More old-school on
the main courses.

634
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,642
Fish and chips with
mushy peas over there,

635
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,979
Steak and Stilton pie for me,
because any mystery meat

636
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,565
wrapped in pastry at a pub
is pure crack for me.

637
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,775
Thank you very much.

638
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,068
Oh, you've got the pie, wow.

639
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,840
Oh, yeah.

640
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:29,569
Hmm.

641
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,613
We don't do this
back in America.

642
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:36,035
So many people have said to me,
"Do you pencil it in first?"

643
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,288
I said, "No, you
just start drawing."

644
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,998
"But don't you make a mistake?"

645
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,250
I said, "There's no such
thing as a mistake."

646
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,170
A mistake is an opportunity
to do something else.

647
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,881
You have to leave it and let
nature take its course.

648
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,967
Oh, my God, now,
isn't that lovely?

649
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,594
That is... I like... I'm
impressing myself.

650
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,888
It's so good.

651
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,598
All of nature is
impressing me, actually.

652
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,601
That it's just so
wonderful how it works.

653
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:06,773
It's a kind of natural process
of evolution, isn't it?

654
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,486
It's what we're
doing all the time.

655
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,279
You're certainly your
depiction of politicians

656
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,865
early on. You seemed filled
with rage and disgust,

657
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,283
deservedly, I'd think.

658
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,203
And there were some epic
depictions of Nixon.

659
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,247
Was it Nixon as Godzilla,
was it, that I...

660
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,915
Yeah, he was a great subject.

661
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,293
I mean, I've done him as a
flying Nixon, a vampire Nixon,

662
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,628
bat Nixon... Did you ever
get an official reaction

663
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,831
to your work from
the White House?

664
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,860
Never.

665
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:33,342
"I am not a giant,
shitting Godzilla."

666
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,345
You don't wanna deny that.

667
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,931
No, it's funny how that was.

668
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,266
And Boris Johnson here.

669
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,142
I think the hair, in
this case, is just...

670
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,643
It's an irresistible impulse.

671
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,645
Well, to do it, I... I've
got to come out

672
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,147
with it more [indistinct]

673
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,606
But it's perfect.

674
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,445
Boris is our Trump.

675
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,654
Well, they're both...
It is a supernova

676
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,676
of incredibly bad hair.

677
00:26:55,677 --> 00:26:56,656
Yeah.

678
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,889
I mean, the two of them together...
What's happening? What's

679
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,078
going on in this country?

680
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,704
Is it gonna be okay?

681
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,331
Not at the moment, no.

682
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,666
Does it say anything about
the country as a whole?

683
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,876
So, I think it does.

684
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:10,379
Perhaps there's been a
secret desire to really say,

685
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,507
"Wait a minute, what would
it be like to be on a...

686
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,759
The... a great British
Isles again?"

687
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,761
I was doing this last week just

688
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,722
because I can't stand
snakes, so I said,

689
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:21,681
"Okay, I'll do you one."

690
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:26,145
I did one snake last week,
decided to do this,

691
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,606
Saint Lucia racer snake.

692
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,690
Ugh, right there.

693
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,111
And then the next day,
we had the referendum.

694
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,697
Friday morning, when people
realized what had happened,

695
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,949
there was a terrible gloom.

696
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,993
There's a scent I...
We all felt it.

697
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,870
This desire to restore
England to its former glory

698
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,500
as the British Isles, it's
certainly given a revived,

699
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:51,108
a very powerful urge in Scotland...
to reconsider whether

700
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,630
they wanna be a part.

701
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,798
Oh, dear. I think it's
only gonna get worse

702
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,509
- -before it gets better.
- Uh-hmm.

703
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,969
And I'm certain that what we
are experiencing at the moment

704
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,431
is a kind of rather large
hangover from something

705
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:07,561
that we've still got to come
to terms with and get over.

706
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,230
Do you think some of your
stuff has anger in there,

707
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:14,443
or exasperation, or...
That's... I think so... look,

708
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:18,780
I said to... I don't know,
50 years ago that I wanted

709
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:23,118
to change the world, and
I think, 50 years later,

710
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,036
I succeeded.

711
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:27,914
It's worse now than it was when
I started, so I changed it,

712
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,167
being that was... This is great.

713
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,481
It's kind of emerging.

714
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:32,752
You know, it's coming.

715
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,047
I mean, this guy, he
demands a Steadman.

716
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:40,093
He really... -Something... -He
was born to have you work...

717
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,097
I try to lighten it up a bit.

718
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,402
The sea.

719
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,071
The sea, where a man
can forget his trouble

720
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,866
and the troubles of the
world, commune with something

721
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:05,744
infinitely larger and more
powerful than himself.

722
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:11,791
Where he could find himself
locked in an epic struggle

723
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:16,004
with a creature of the sea,
plumbing the depths for that

724
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:16,004
most primordial of needs:

725
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,006
food.

726
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,217
Well, let's hope we
have them quick.

727
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,751
Get off, get off.

728
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,298
Oh, my God, there's
the forehook, look.

729
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,091
Oh, my God.

730
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,842
Not good.

731
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,513
Oh, my God, it got the bait.

732
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,768
Nature, it's overrated.

733
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,136
We're in the middle of
the English Channel.

734
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,275
We are designed to find,
kill, tear apart,

735
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,860
and devour the food
we need to survive.

736
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,967
It is why God, in His
wisdom, gave us legs upon

737
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:25,469
which to run, eyes in
the front of our heads

738
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,951
to seek out prey,
fingernails and thumbs

739
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,869
with which to tear
apart our victims,

740
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,207
teeth to smash flesh and bone
between our mighty jaws.

741
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:46,512
♪

742
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,476
Here in the coastal
town of Weymouth

743
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,561
at the Marlboro is
where I'll be smashing

744
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,063
deep-fried haddock
between my freaking jaws

745
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,940
with something called a chip.

746
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,901
Sliced white bread and butter
so we can make a chip butty.

747
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,069
Would you like a chip butty?

748
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,280
I don't know that
I've ever had one.

749
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,906
- I've heard of them.
- Delicious.

750
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,575
All right, you're an
easy man to please.

751
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,161
The chef suggests the mushy peas

752
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,913
infused with butter and cream.

753
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,367
I have such fond
memories of Weymouth.

754
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,501
My sons went to school
just down the road.

755
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,295
I used to bring them to the
Marlboro for lunch and that.

756
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,963
And they weren't big
fans of fish and chips

757
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,342
because they were, sort of, 13,
14 and they preferred meat

758
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:26,552
to fish and chips.

759
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,513
But this is the best restaurant,
in my opinion, in Weymouth.

760
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,597
Thank you.

761
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,932
Thank you, thank you,
that's very kind.

762
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,518
I'll put the mushy
peas in the middle.

763
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,353
You see, this is how
we do it in Yorkshire.

764
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,772
So go ahead and taste the
mushy peas without vinegar.

765
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,106
Bon appétit.

766
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,107
They're all right.

767
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,652
Now, put the vinegar on.

768
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:48,782
Oh, my... So working-class,
as they say in Yorkshire.

769
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:49,867
Mmm.

770
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,985
Would you prefer
them with vinegar?

771
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,986
It transforms the whole thing.

772
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,246
Completely different, isn't it?

773
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,874
I love buttering my bread.

774
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,375
Now, this is the best bit.

775
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,794
I can't believe you've
never had a chip butty.

776
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:01,961
Well, today's the day.

777
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,963
When I was a kid, this
was one of my favorites.

778
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,966
The only fish I ever ate as
a child was fried haddock.

779
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,968
Wouldn't eat any other fish.

780
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,972
And then the vinegar,
quite generous.

781
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,391
And then the salt.

782
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,976
And this is what we call a
chip butty in Yorkshire

783
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,395
where I come from.

784
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,568
Mmm.

785
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,154
I like the cheap bread
because the bread turns

786
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,155
into the same texture
as the potato.

787
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:29,989
Right.

788
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,283
That's why it's perfect.

789
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:35,141
If you have posh bread
or crusty bread, -Right.

790
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:35,995
...it's not the same.

791
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,018
How's your haddock?

792
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:39,999
Good.

793
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,419
But it's proper working-class
food, is fish and chips.

794
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,004
Yeah, when I was a kid,
we'd eat them twice a week.

795
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,945
They'd cook fish and chips in
dripping, -beef fat, not oil.

796
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:48,842
Uh-hmm.

797
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,678
It makes a massive, massive
difference in the flavor.

798
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,013
Yeah.

799
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,891
It's quite good.

800
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:56,892
You were hungry.

801
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,852
We worked hard out there.

802
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,646
Keeping warm.

803
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,481
Indeed.

804
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,690
It's big.

805
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:04,900
It's too big, look, I'm done.

806
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,652
One more bite, yeah, me too.

807
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,611
That's my problem.

808
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,697
I go for the chip butty
before the fish.

809
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,743
It's the child within me.

810
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,922
Hidden away safely behind
the walls of a former

811
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:29,716
Victorian-era schoolhouse,
insulated from the moronic

812
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:33,052
inferno blazing outside,
is Rochelle Canteen,

813
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,764
a green idyll, the
unpretentious brainchild

814
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,078
of Margot Henderson and
her business partner

815
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,058
Melanie Arnold.

816
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,894
How long have you been
up and running here?

817
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:41,708
Ten years.

818
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:45,106
- God, I can't believe...
- Ten years, where have you been?

819
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,106
I know, what is wrong with me?

820
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,066
You were a chef
before Fergus, yes?

821
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,902
Yeah. Well, I started
cooking in restaurants

822
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,069
- -when I was 12.
- Yeah.

823
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,113
But this is Fergus,
peas in their pods.

824
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,073
We met when I was
working at the Eagle,

825
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,160
and I said straightaway
to him, "We should open"

826
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,160
a restaurant together."

827
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,078
And he said, "Well,
that's a good idea",

828
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,455
but let's be lovers as well,"

829
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,290
which I always thought
was quite good.

830
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,084
And then we had a restaurant.

831
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,087
The whole area has
changed down to it.

832
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,445
It's very Shoreditch,
groovy guys on little

833
00:34:11,446 --> 00:34:13,092
motorbikes with handlebars.

834
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,379
What was the neighborhood
like before?

835
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,513
Quite a large Bengali community.

836
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,182
Before that, it was quite a
strong Jewish community.

837
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,894
But then they moved out,
next group move in.

838
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,269
It's a poor area.

839
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,606
A lot of people working in the
fabric, clothing industries.

840
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,526
The bandstand in the middle is
all the rubble from the war.

841
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,152
I think the gardeners
still find, you know,

842
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,155
children's shoes and things.

843
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,740
Really?

844
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,283
It is a very interesting area.

845
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,495
Just how beautiful
these blocks are.

846
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,288
It's quite a lot
of building works

847
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,523
- -going on at the moment as well.
- Everywhere in London.

848
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,544
I mean, the whole city seems
to be, kind of, transforming.

849
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:51,048
It's certainly expensive...
My daughter, she's moving

850
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,216
because of what happened
today about the EU.

851
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,135
She's going to either live
in Scotland or New Zealand.

852
00:34:56,177 --> 00:35:01,140
And she's so embarrassed
and ashamed to be English.

853
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,142
Is it the end of the world?

854
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,978
It feels... right now, it feels
like the end of the world.

855
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,230
We have separated.

856
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,335
We're a little mean
island saying,

857
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:10,651
"When the going gets
tough, we want to get out

858
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,069
and just look after ourselves."

859
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,154
It's so selfish and disgusting.

860
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,638
It's also, out of London,
there is a lot of people

861
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,702
who are really struggling
and have lost their way

862
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:23,162
and don't believe in what
the government has done.

863
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,164
So, I don't blame
the people either.

864
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,167
But they're being fed, sort
of, lies, I would say.

865
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,169
Anyway, it's all too depressing.

866
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,672
We must change the subject.

867
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,884
Vitello tonnato, cold-roasted
veal thinly sliced

868
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:39,387
and covered with a creamy
sauce of tuna and capers.

869
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,805
Oh, this looks good.

870
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,181
These are good.

871
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,224
Hmm.

872
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:44,225
So, what's going right?

873
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,978
I mean, it's a bad day to ask.

874
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,931
Well, there's lots of great
restaurants opening in the city.

875
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,606
Right, London, and
UK in general.

876
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,858
It's just gotten just better
and better every year, right.

877
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,985
It's brilliant, isn't it?

878
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,193
It's so exciting.

879
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,487
Great chefs... The
people who voted "for,"

880
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,614
was it a sense of people
who feel they just...

881
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,782
They've been screwed?

882
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,659
I mean, young people,
unemployment in the north,

883
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,764
it's dire.

884
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:02,828
Right.

885
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,913
People haven't got jobs.

886
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:07,206
But, I mean, everyone's
looking for chefs.

887
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:07,811
Right.

888
00:36:07,812 --> 00:36:10,877
Why we should turn... We should
set up some great big new

889
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,211
cookery schools in Britain.

890
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,213
I mean, no one can get
enough decent chef.

891
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,049
- Uh-hmm.
- Some more encouragement.

892
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,926
I mean, there is work to be had.

893
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:22,221
But it's just how you find
it and where you come from.

894
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,851
Lamb chops with lentils
and green sauce.

895
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,062
Hmm, so good.

896
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,264
Where'd this little
lamb come from?

897
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,273
From Wales, Welsh lamb.

898
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,444
Nice. People who dine out now,
do they want food simpler

899
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,696
and more stripped down,
and with less bullshit,

900
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,448
or do you think it's
going the other way?

901
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,492
Simple, but with
a sort of twist.

902
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,078
That have got a story about
where it's come from.

903
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,454
- Right.
- It's very interesting.

904
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:49,541
You know, they're all
coming up with new dishes.

905
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,919
Should I be buying pounds now with...
No, that's what

906
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,545
I kept thinking.

907
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,671
What do we all do now?

908
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,506
If I were a cruelly
cynical, exploitative...

909
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,257
That little [indistinct]

910
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,844
You know... what would I...
What would I be doing?

911
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,261
Are you selling
or you're buying?

912
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,297
Yeah, I don't... I'm [indistinct]

913
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,058
Look at me, master
of high finance.

914
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,184
You look so well.

915
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:07,934
Well, thank you.

916
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,269
You must be...
You're making me feel

917
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,269
much better without them.

918
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,355
This meal and the
wine, I have to say,

919
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,254
your company has made me feel
much better about the world

920
00:37:15,255 --> 00:37:16,234
and myself.

921
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:31,290
Can you reinvent yourself
in England or in London...

922
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,500
I mean, maybe you can.

923
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,459
I'm sure you can.

924
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,587
But people are obsessed
with class here.

925
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,984
Still, really?

926
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:38,339
Yes, yeah, absolutely.

927
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,299
It's our measure
of authenticity.

928
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,095
So people are always
trying to bust people.

929
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:43,824
"He's a toff!"

930
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:44,512
you know.

931
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:45,680
What is a toff?

932
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,265
An aristocrat, yeah.

933
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,808
Aristocrat? Right.

934
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,395
My friend Adrian wrote a book
called "The Angry Isle,"

935
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,564
and he talks about how
the British are famous

936
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:59,757
for being polite, apologizing
a lot, but that that actually

937
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:01,320
masks a deep anger.

938
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,322
Do you think there's any
truth to that at all?

939
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,734
Well, I think... because
I've been spending

940
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,326
a lot of time in California,
which is, you know...

941
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,061
And so when you... when
you come to London...

942
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:12,249
If you come to London for
a month, you won't make

943
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,708
any friends, and you probably
won't find anywhere to go,

944
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,162
- but after that, the best people
- you've ever met in your life.

945
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,422
When I went to LA, that first
month, I was so popular.

946
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,217
Everyone's... I started,
like, six bands, and then,

947
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:23,051
nothing comes of it.

948
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:26,178
There's a kind of real first
impression thing... -Right

949
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,347
...that doesn't go anywhere.

950
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,976
In London, it's just get
it done and deal with it.

951
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,435
Right.

952
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,979
Well, hey!

953
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,521
See, here we go.

954
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,690
We're closing, closing.

955
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:39,651
[indistinct] closing...
Get [indistinct] some.

956
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,237
Staggering news is
now sinking in.

957
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,363
Markets are giving
a brutal reaction.

958
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,408
When the world seems like
it's spinning out of control,

959
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,182
and the inside of your skull
feels like it's being gnawed on

960
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:51,037
by angry wolverines.

961
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,249
The sun has risen on a
completely different UK

962
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,625
and a completely different EU.

963
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,377
When you wake up still
tasting tequila,

964
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,673
feeling shame, fear, and
regret in equal measures,

965
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,530
it's good to have a friend...
Europe's weaker,

966
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:07,053
Britain's divided,
where do we go now?

967
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,848
...who, without judgment, gives
you a shoulder to cry on

968
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:15,394
and maybe a simple good thing,
like some eggs and sympathy.

969
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,190
I'm horribly and
savagely hungover.

970
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,440
That's very unlike you.

971
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,483
I was feeling shame, and
regret, -and mourning...

972
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,278
Yeah, you're not the only one.

973
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,654
Don't know what's happening.

974
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,073
Okay, I'm gonna give you
some eggs in Purgatory.

975
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,407
Why Purgatory?

976
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,203
Because they're in chili
sauce and tomatoes,

977
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,411
special hangover cure.

978
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,288
I know you need it.

979
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:34,122
I... yes.

980
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:37,459
Now, do you know about the
delicacy -of fried slice?

981
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,584
No.

982
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,296
English delicacy which is
like British bruschetta,

983
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,401
you fry plastic bread.

984
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:43,464
Uh-hmm.

985
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,509
I've got some really
good beef dripping.

986
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,408
Kind of magical.

987
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:50,429
Pure grease.

988
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,640
It's a... I... that's what
I need right now.

989
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,100
Yeah.

990
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,062
I think that's how
everyone felt a bit

991
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,064
after the referendum too.

992
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,558
I think there's something
very strange about you

993
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,693
because you look normal but
it's all going on inside.

994
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,029
Yes, you have got a slight
pleading look in your eyes.

995
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,948
I do. It's a... Okay, the
whole point of this is,

996
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,450
the plastic bread
soaks in all the fat.

997
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,911
Right.

998
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,287
So when you eat it, it bursts
with grease in your mouth.

999
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,664
It's that good.

1000
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,416
I like the noise.

1001
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,815
Here, I'm gonna give it to you.

1002
00:40:21,816 --> 00:40:24,547
It may still be a bit
runny I like runny.

1003
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,547
I need runny today.

1004
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,341
Okay.

1005
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:29,072
Just try a bit dry first, so
you can just get the fats

1006
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:30,469
going into your mouth.

1007
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,679
Hmm.

1008
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,182
There is light and hope
in the universe again.

1009
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,878
- Thank you.
- That's what I aim to provide.

1010
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:40,438
Spice, runny eggs, and
grease, just what I needed.

1011
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,086
Hmm, so good.

1012
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:44,483
I have something absolvent.

1013
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,861
You know that thing in "The
Simpsons" once when he wants

1014
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,072
to put on weight so he
doesn't have to go to work?

1015
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,908
And he allows himself to eat
things that when you rub it

1016
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,201
on something it makes it
go see-through, like that.

1017
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,493
"Your window to weight gain."

1018
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,455
Yes, here, here,
just make this turn

1019
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,374
see-through now if you want.

1020
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:02,210
I can see myself in
about six months.

1021
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,962
I do feel quite pleased
that we can be

1022
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,297
a corrupting influence.

1023
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,132
That's something that
we can be proud of.

1024
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,512
These are frightening
times for many.

1025
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,724
The world is changing,
and there is no stopping

1026
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:16,808
those changes.

1027
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,812
But in such times, there
are always two ways to go,

1028
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:25,358
run and hide, build walls,
cower in fear and suspicion,

1029
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,674
point the finger at our
neighbors, look, like desperate,

1030
00:41:28,675 --> 00:41:32,031
frightened people do,
for someone to blame,

1031
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:35,910
or stand up and try... at least
try to build a better world,

1032
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:39,205
to look for, instead of a
man on a horse to save us

1033
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:43,501
or a wall to keep us apart,
to our better angels.
