1
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,139
>> I ALWAYS FEEL SLIGHTLY

2
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:42,910
DEPRESSED BY BEAUTIFUL VISTAS,

3
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:49,317
YOU KNOW I MEAN?

4
00:00:55,523 --> 00:01:36,564
*

5
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:40,501
>>> AH, THE STORYBOOK KINGDOM OF

6
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:40,801
GRENADA.

7
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,504
ONE OF THE OLDEST, MOST COMPLEX,

8
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,905
MAGICALLY SURREAL PLACES IN

9
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:45,173
SPAIN.

10
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:49,009
AND ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL.

11
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,911
GRENADA IS TUCKED AGAINST THE

12
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,813
SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS OF

13
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:56,684
ANDALUCIA IN SOUTHERN SPAIN.

14
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:57,651
IT'S NOT LIKE BARCELONA.

15
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,688
IT AIN'T MADRID.

16
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,223
ANY REASONABLE PERSON WHO LOOKS

17
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:04,091
AT SPAIN, COMES TO SPAIN, EATS

18
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,993
IN SPAIN, DRINKS IN SPAIN,

19
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,396
THEY'RE GOING TO FALL IN LOVE.

20
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:09,163
OTHERWISE, THERE'S SOMETHING

21
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,932
DEEPLY WRONG WITH YOU.

22
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,867
SPAIN IS THE SORT OF PLACE THAT

23
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,503
NEVER REALLY MADE ANY SENSE

24
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:15,869
ANYWAY.

25
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,037
BUT IN THE VERY BEST POSSIBLE

26
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,274
WAY.

27
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,675
THIS IS THE COUNTRY THAT GAVE US

28
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,244
THE SPANISH INQUISITION.

29
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,912
ALSO ANARCHY.

30
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:28,182
THIS IS WHERE DEVOUT CATHOLICISM

31
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:33,387
MIXES WITH SURREALISM, MODERNIST

32
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,455
CUISINE.

33
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:35,956
CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM SPARED

34
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:36,190
SPACE.

35
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,192
THE EFFECTS OF INFLUENCES OF ALL

36
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,460
THOSE THINGS ARE RIGHT HERE TO

37
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,131
SEE.

38
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,300
YOU CAN ALMOST LOOK BACK THROUGH

39
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,104
TIME AND SEE THE VENETIANS

40
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:57,778
MARCHING UP.

41
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,580
OR ARE THOSE FERAL HIPPIES?

42
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,753
MANY OF THEM MADE THINGS

43
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:06,053
INTERESTING.

44
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,154
WHEREVER YOU ARE ON THE

45
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,322
IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM, SOME

46
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:12,593
THINGS ARE CONSTANT, IT SEEMS.

47
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,162
SOME STEREOTYPICAL EXPECTATIONS.

48
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:21,802
IT'S TRUE, THERE ARE FREE TAPAS

49
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,103
EVERYWHERE.

50
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:23,637
FLAMEN

51
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:24,405
FLAMENCO, YES, THEY DO THAT

52
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:24,605
ALSO.

53
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,340
BUT IN GRANADA, THEY DO IT OLD

54
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,640
SCHOOL.

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,742
AND OH YEAH, BULLFIGHTING.

56
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:35,283
THEY DO THAT HERE, TOO.

57
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:38,085
BUT I DIGRESS.

58
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,420
I'M HERE TO ANSWER A QUESTION.

59
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,654
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GO OVER TO

60
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:41,689
THE OTHER SIDE?

61
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,856
SAY YOU GREW UP IN THE STATES

62
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,958
AND WONDERED, FANTASIZED ABOUT

63
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,327
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING

64
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,262
ABROAD IN OLD EUROPE, SURROUNDED

65
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:51,365
BY CRUSADER CASTLES, DELICIOUS

66
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,767
FOOD, ANOTHER LANGUAGE, ANOTHER

67
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:54,001
CULTURE?

68
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,636
WHAT WOULD THAT ALTERNATE LIFE,

69
00:03:55,636 --> 00:04:00,007
THAT ROAD NOT TAKEN BE LIKE?

70
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,777
MY LONGTIME FRIEND AND CAMERAMAN

71
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,714
FROM MAINE ZACK IS FINDING OUT.

72
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:07,881
SO WHERE ARE WE GOING?

73
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,618
>> RIGHT HERE, ONE OF THESE

74
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:10,851
TABLES.

75
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,154
MAYBE WE WANT TO DO THIS WITH.

76
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:14,955
SEE?

77
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,625
HOW OFTEN CAN YOU GO OUT WITH

78
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,060
SOMEBODY WHO CAN APPROPRIATELY

79
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,061
BLOCK THE TABLE?

80
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,397
>> AY, YES, OF COURSE.

81
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,832
SNAILS IN AN ALMOND SAUCE.

82
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,467
ABOUT AS TRADITIONAL AND

83
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:33,173
DELICIOUS AS IT GETS.

84
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,542
TAPAS COME FROM HERE.

85
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,143
THIS IS STILL ONE OF THE FEW

86
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,178
PLACES IN SPAIN WHERE THEY'RE

87
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:38,412
FREE.

88
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:42,249
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KEEP

89
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:42,550
DRINKING.

90
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,718
>> YOU CAN SIT HERE ALL DAY.

91
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:45,886
ORDER A COUPLE DRINKS.

92
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,187

SPENDER, SPICY, DELICIOUS TRIPE.

PRETTY GOOD.

100

HELLO.

BASICALLY DEFECTED TO SPAIN, HE

104
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,043
MET FUEN.

105
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,278
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, HE'S

LIVING HERE.

107
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,282
PART OF AN EXTENDED ANDALUCIAN

108
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:15,616
FAMILY.

109
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,518
LIVING THE LIFE OF THE SPANISH

00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:17,718
DANDY.

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,692
SENSITIVE, NICE, CARING

115
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,125
THOUGHTFUL GUY?

116
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,928
>> WELL, IT DEPENDS ON THE

117
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:28,596
WOMAN, FIRST.

118
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:30,564
BUT USUALLY WE LOOK FOR THIS

119
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,766
KIND OF PERSON THAT WE KNOW HE

120
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:37,104
WILL PROTECT US.

121
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,573
>> FROM WHAT?

122
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:40,741
FERAL HIPPIES?

123
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,576
>> I WOULD LIKE TO DO THE VOWS

124
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,478
OF YOUR WEDDING.

125
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,815
DO YOU SWEAR TO PROTECT FUEN

126
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,384
SANCHEZ ATTACKS BY CAVE-DWELLING

127
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:50,618
HIPPIES?

128
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,920
WHO ATTEMPT TO SELL HER JEWELRY

129
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,324
OR OTHER THINGS OF LITTLE VALUE.

130
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,292
>> I FIGURE NOW THAT ZACK IS

131
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,828

>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO GET

141
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:24,418
INTO METAPHYSICS.

142
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,819
>> YOU ARE GOING TO END UP

143
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,021
LIVING IN A CAVE IF YOU KEEP

144
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:32,025
TALKING LIKE THIS.

145
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,827
MORE WINE.

146
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,362
TO SEE SPAIN, TO SEE IT

147
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,131
STRAIGHT, TO UNDERSTAND IT AT

148
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,434
ALL, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY PEEK,

149
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,435
IF ONLY THROUGH SPREAD FINGERS,

00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,537
AT THAT MOST SPANISH OF

151
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:47,608
TRADITIONS.

152
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,109
BULLFIGHTING.

153
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,712
MEET ALFANDI, ONE OF SPAIN'S

154
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,313
MOST DASHING AND RESPECTED

155
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:53,647
BULLFIGHTERS.

156
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,550
HE'S INVITED ME TO A RANCH, A

157
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,288
PRIVATE BULL RING WHERE HE LIKES

158
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,523
TO PRACTICE.

159
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:07,060
>> SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO

160
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,463
NOW IS SEE HOW BRAVE --

161
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:13,300

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,534
STEW.

163
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,236
>> AND FUEN'S BROTHER ALEJANDRO,

00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,906
CONSIDER BULLFIGHTING AN ART.

166
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,240
TODAY A LITTLE PRACTICE FIRST.

167
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,809
DON'T WORRY, THIS GUY IS TOO

168
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:41,328
YOUNG TO FIGHT.

169
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,930
>> YOU SEE THE RED CAPE, YOU

170
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,264
KNOW THIS IS THE MOST THING.

171
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,600
WHERE THEY MAKE ALL THE ART, ALL

172
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,203
THE POETRY.

173
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,238
>> WHY THE CAPE?

174
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,506
>> BECAUSE IT'S MOVING.

175
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:57,210
>> SO THAT'S IMPORTANT?

176
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,715
>> YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE

177
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:05,753
MOVING AT ALL.

178
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,187
>> THIS GUY CLEARLY HAS SPIRIT.

179
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,623
RIGHT AWAY HE TRIES TO TAKE A

180
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:15,629
POKE AT ZACK'S FEMORAL ARTERY.

181
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,965
PROMISING.

182
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,432
>> HE'S GOING TO TEACH YOU.

183
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,102
>> NO.

184
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,070
>> SURE.

185
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,373
>> NO ONE LIKES TO LOOK LIKE A

186
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,309
PUSSY ON TV, SO WHEN HE

187
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,945
SUGGESTED I JOIN HIM TO WAVE A

188
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:36,584
PINK CAPE AT AN AGGRESSIVE YOUNG

189
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,118
BULL, I SAID WHAT ANY IDIOT

190
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,219
WOULD SAY -- SI.

191
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,621
IT ALL STARTS WELL ENOUGH.

192
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:44,958
HEY, THIS IS FUN.

193
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,995
THIS IS EASY.

194
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,330
UNTIL I GET A HORN HOOKED RIGHT

195
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,332
UP NEXT TO MY NUTSACK.

196
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:57,671
THEN IT'S NOT SO FUN.

197
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,072
THANKS, GUYS.

198
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:03,911
THIS YOUNGSTER SHALL LIVE,

199
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,613
PERHAPS TO GORE A FUTURE TV HOST

200
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:09,116
WITH HIS MIGHTY HORNS.

201
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:13,987
NOW THIS IS WHAT A REAL BULL

202
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,356
LOOKS LIKE.

203
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:21,862
THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING.

204
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,664
500-FREAKING-KILOS OF AGGRESSIVE

205
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:29,536
CHARGING KILLDOZER AIMING AT

206
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:33,540
YOUR MEAT.

207
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,842
IT'S A LOT OF MUSCLE.

208
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,509
>> YEAH, IT'S A LOT OF MUSCLE.

209
00:09:36,509 --> 00:10:10,878
THAT'S A BIG BULL.

210
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:17,384
*

211
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,852
>> NO MATTER HOW BIG, HOW

212
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,855
STRONG, HOW SCARY, FOR THIS

213
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,256
INTREPID REPORTER WHO'S SEEN

214
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,192
MANY ANIMALS DIE FOR HIS DINNER,

215
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,360
THIS PART IS NEVER EASY.

216
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,362
>> SO AS YOU SEE, HE PUTS THE

217
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,430
CAPE LOWER.

218
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,766
SO WHEN THE BULL BRINGS THE FACE

219
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:39,506
FORWARD, SHOWING THE NECK --

220
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,073
THAT'S IT.

221
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:44,678
THAT WAS VERY GOOD.

222
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:45,445
THAT'S IT.

223
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:50,450
>> IT'S TIME FOR STU.

224
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,184
BULL STEW.

225
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:55,723
OUR FRIEND WENT TO A BETTER

226
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:56,957
PLACE.

227
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,558
LOCAL HERBS, POE TODAY TOES.

228
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:03,463
NOTHING LIKE A ROARING FIRE,

229
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,299
SPANISH CHEESES, BREAD, AND GOOD

230
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:11,138
OLIVE OIL TO TAKE THE STING OUT

231
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:16,810
OF A NEAR GENITAL MUTILATION.

232
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,246
>> IT'S NOT A BAD PLACE.

233
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:33,660
>> HE STARTED AT AGE 19?

234
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,962
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY

235
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,798
GROWING UP, YOU ASPIRED TO BE A

236
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,165
MATADOR.

237
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,733
THE MATADORS WERE THE ORIGINAL

238
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:44,071
ROCK STARS, THE IDEAL OF

239
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,338
MASCULINITY, MALE BEAUTY, AND

240
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:45,572
GRACE.

241
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,840
THAT RUNS DEEP.

242
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,508
LIKE IT OR NOT, YOU SHOULD

243
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,509
PROBABLY KNOW THIS BEFORE DATING

244
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:54,347
A SPANISH GUY.

245
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,684
THERE IS NO DENYING THE TERRIBLE

246
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,755
BEAUTY OF THE VERY COMPLEX

247
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:02,522
TRADITION.

248
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:05,292
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT WINNING.

249
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:05,959
IT'S NOT ABOUT KILLING THE BULL.

250
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,697
AND NOR IS IT ABOUT BEING JUST

251
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:10,998
SKILLFUL.

252
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,299
YOU HAVE TO LOOK GOOD DOING IT,

253
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:12,465
TOO.

254
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,202
ARE THERE ANY UGLY ASS

255
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:15,535
BULLFIGHTERS?

256
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,370
A REALLY OUT OF SHAPE -- A

257
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,005
MUFFIN TOP.

258
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:25,678
HOW DO YOU CALL A MUFFIN TOP?

259
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:26,546
>> WE HAVE EVERYTHING.

260
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,981
>> WELL, IT WAS AN EDUCATION

261
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,350
TODAY, AND A GREAT MEAL.

262
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:30,617
THANK YOU.

263
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,220
>> CHEERS.

264
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,188
>> CHEERS.

265
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,515
>>> HOLY WEEK.

266
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,517
OR SEMANA SANTA AS IT'S CALLED.

267
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,418
OBSERVED ALL OVER SOUTHERN SPAIN

268
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,154
WITH A SERIOUSNESS AND FERVOR

269
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:21,268
YOU MIGHT NOT SEE ELSEWHERE.

270
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,036
FOR SEVEN DAYS LEADING UP TO

271
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,271
EASTER, NEARLY EVERY CITY IN

272
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,007
ANDALUCIA GETS TAKEN OVER BY

273
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,241
ANCIENT PROCESSIONS.

274
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,377
TO AN OUTSIDER, IT'S AN

275
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,578
IMPENETRABLE MONTAGE OF

276
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,914
CONFUSING, YET DEEPLY EVOCATIVE

277
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:34,714
IMAGES.

278
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,516
FIGURES IN DARK HOODS LOOM UP

279
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,086
FROM EVERY DIRECTION.

280
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:42,222
SPOKE POTS OF INSECTS, CANDLES,

281
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,357
RELIGIOUS IMAGERY, AND THE

282
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:44,591
CROWDS.

283
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,227
FLASHES OF GOYA, DIMLY

284
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:52,432
REMEMBERED IMPRESSIONS OF THE

285
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:59,539
INQUISITION.

286
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,373
OKAY, WATCH THIS.

287
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:04,777
THESE GUYS GOT TO GET THEIR

288
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,445
PAINSTAKINGLY CRAFTED MASSIVELY

289
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,215
SIZED AND INCREDIBLY HEAVY AND

290
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:08,882
CUMBERSOME FLOAT THROUGH THE

291
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:13,753
DOOR, DOWN THE STEPS, AND OUT

292
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:21,061
INTO THE STREET.

293
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,163
PEDRO IS ANOTHER OF FUEN'S

294
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,664
BROTHERS, THE YOUNGEST, AND WHEN

295
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,566
NOT WORKING FOR AN I.T. COMPANY

296
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,901
IN IRELAND, HE DOES THIS.

297
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,270
HE CARRIES CRUSHINGLY HEAVY

298
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,471
RELIGIOUS FLOATS.

299
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:43,316
THEY'RE CALLED ED CASTELEROS.

300
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,953
THE VIRGIN FLOAT, ABOUT 3,500

301
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,121
POUNDS TOTAL, AND PRECISE

302
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,322
DIMENSIONS THAT HAVE TO MAKE IT

303
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,757
THROUGH DOOR JUST SO.

304
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,961
THE BEARERS HAVE TO KNEEL.

305
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,662
CRAWL ALONG WITH IT ON THEIR

306
00:14:55,662 --> 00:15:00,033
BACKS TO GET IT THROUGH THE

307
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:10,643
DOOR.

308
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,279
AND THE MAIN EVENT.

309
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:49,382
READY, SET, UP.

310
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,183
LET'S FACE IT.

311
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,652
I LIKE A PROCESSION AND ALL, BUT

312
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,321
WHO LIKES A BUNCH OF GUYS IN

313
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,424
HOODS COMING IN YOUR GENERAL

314
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:57,690
DIRECTION?

315
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:57,924
I DON'T.

316
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:58,525
FRANKLY, IT FREAKS ME OUT.

317
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:04,364
TIME FOR A DRINK, PERHAPS.

318
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,766
THIS IS AN EASTERN JESUS AND

DRINKS, ONE CAN PONDER THE AGONY

322
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:15,575
OF CHRIST, BUT WITH SOME SAUSA

323
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:15,875
SAUSAGES.

324
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,776
IS IT LIKE THIS ALL YEAR?

325
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,778

THIS A PARTY WEEK OR BOTH?

331
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,622
>> BOTH OF THEM.

332
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:30,857
>> THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE

333
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,792
WEEK, OVER 40-ODD PROCESSIONS

334
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,428
WILL CREEP SLOWLY FROM THESE

335
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:35,895
STREETS.

336
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:36,929
THERE ARE DIFFERENT

337
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:37,797
BROTHERHOODS, EACH WITH THEIR

338
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,733
OWN SACRED COLORS, CRESTS,

339
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,901
INSIGNIA AND SO ON.

340
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,203
IT'S THEIR MEDALLIONS OF

341
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,404
PARTICULAR CHRIST IMAGES THAT

342
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,238
ADORN THE BAR.

343
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,873
AND FRANKLY, THEY'RE KIND OF

344
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:47,574
BUMMING ME OUT.

345
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,276
MAYBE IT'S JUST ME, BUT WHEN I'M

346
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,810

351
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,986
DON'T YOU FEEL A LITTLE GUILTY

352
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:05,925
FOR GETTING REALLY DRUNK HERE?

353
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:06,593

>> TRY IT.

357
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,401
IT'S AMAZING.

358
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,003

I AM HAPPY NOW.

HILLSIDE OF SACRAMONTE IS

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,249
RIDDLED WITH CAVES, MANY OLDER

364
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,583

ARE MORE EMBRACED BY THE CULTURE

383
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,068
HERE THAN MOST OTHER PLACES IN

384
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:56,336
EUROPE.

385
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,037
>> WE HAVE OUR OWN GYPSIES.

00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:58,738
THOSE ARE OURS.

WE DO TAPAS.

391
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,785
AND WE DO SIESTAS.

>> THEY DIG DEEP FOR THEIR

401
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:43,903
MATERIAL HERE.

402
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:44,837
IT MEANS SOMETHING.

403
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:49,175
THEY'RE TELLING YOU SOMETHING

404
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,242
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

405
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:58,351
>> WHAT IS -- I'VE HEARD IT.

406
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,620
IS IT AN EMOTIONAL STATE OR A

407
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,290
TECHNICAL --

408
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:12,565
>> NO.

409
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,735
>> IS UNHAPPINESS NECESSARY FOR

410
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,269
GREAT ART?

411
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:24,411
>> IT'S NECESSARY, BUT

412
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:24,711
MAGNIFICO.

413
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:29,416
>> YOU'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

414
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:33,219
THAT.

415
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,054
>> YOU PERFORM VERY WELL AFTER A

416
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:35,755
COUPLE DAYS.

417
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:40,292
>> I MAY NOT HAVE ONE DAY,

418
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,495
DUENDE, BUT I HAVE VALENTINE'S.

419
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,431
I KNOW THAT EXPRESSION.

420
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:48,568
WAIT A MINUTE.

421
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,748
>>> NIGHTTIME IN GRANADA.

422
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,282
IT'S TIME TO PURSUE THAT

423
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,452
GREATEST OF SPANISH TRADITIONS,

424
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:09,422
TAPAS.

425
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,858
YOU MAY THINK YOU KNOW WHAT A

426
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:12,592
TAPA IS.

427
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,661
SMALL BITES AT SOME FUSION

428
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,362
HIPSTER BAR.

429
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,297
YEAH, THAT AIN'T A TAPA.

430
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:20,199
>> HOW OFTEN DO YOU DO THIS?

431
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:24,370
>> I DO IT FIVE DAYS A WEEK.

432
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,038
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE ON A

433
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,107
WEEKEND, YOU COME OUT FOR A

434
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:28,641
BUNCH.

435
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,610
WEEKDAY, YOU COME OUT FOR ONE.

436
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,548
>> THIS IS LATANA, A LITTLE

437

PLACE RUN BY JESUS AND LOUISA,

00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:43,055
ONE BARTENDER, ONE COOK, TAKING

439
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,724
CARE OF EVERYTHING.

440
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:45,525
>> IT'S FREE.

441
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:48,695
>> SO YOU'RE JUST PAYING FOR THE

442
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:48,961
WINE.

443
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:56,536
>> SO IF I'M A WINO, I CAN STILL

444
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:57,236
EAT WELL.

445
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,539
>> LET US PUT THIS THEORY INTO

446
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,006
PRACTICE.

447
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,374

AND BLENDED.

451
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:11,217
>> I COULD PRETTY MUCH EAT THAT

452
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,052
ALL DAY.

453
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:13,486
THAT'S RIGHT.

454
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:14,320
TAPAS ARE FREE.

455
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,755
IT SHOULDN'T WORK, BUT SOMEHOW

456
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:16,656
IT DOES.

457
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:20,493
ANOTHER DRINK, ANOTHER TAPA.

458
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:20,993
TOMATO

459
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:23,530

>> MAYBE YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN

465
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:35,241
CAVIAR.

466
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:35,675
>> REALLY?

467
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:38,545
THAT'S NOT INCLUDED?

468
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:40,079
>> THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF THE

469
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:40,580
TAPAS.

470
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,584
USUALLY YOU HAVE A FEW TAPAS.

471
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,519
>> THEY'RE JUST HOOKING YOU IN

472
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,420

00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,127
200 GRAMS OF KAVIER.

477
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:59,866
CAVIAR AIN'T FREE, MY FRIEND.

478
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:04,403
>> YOU CAN GO INTO A PLACE LIKE

WHOLE THING IN ONE.

484
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,950
>> SORRY, IS THERE SOMETHING

485
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,818
WRONG WITH THAT?

486
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:24,657
NOT EVEN MARRIED YET, IT'S NAG,

487
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:25,925
NAG, NAG.

488
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,393
LET'S DO IT.

489
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:27,994
AH TAPAS.

490
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:31,731
WHAT A NOVEL CONCEPT.

491
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:32,398
TAPAYAR.

492
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,399
MEANING TO TAKE TAPAS.

493
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,802
IF WE'RE GOING TO TAPAYAR SOME

494
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:37,570
MORE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

495
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,405
ELBOW PAST THIS CROWD OF

496
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:39,672
CATHOLICS.

497
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,240
>> IS IT EXTRA INSANE?

498
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,847
YES, BUT IT'S ALWAYS BUSY HERE,

499
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,750
MAN.

500
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,252
>> IT'S JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE.

501
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,954
>> WITH PARADES CRISSCROSSING

502
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,789
THE CITY IN EVERY DIRECTION, THE

503
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,958
STEADY DRUM BEAT WARNS THAT YOUR

504
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,259
ROUTE IS ABOUT TO BE CUT OFF

505
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:04,263
ENTIRELY FOR THE NEXT 40

506
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:04,496
MINUTES.

507
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,798
>> WE CAN GET ACROSS.

508
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,601
>> WE HAVE TO GO AROUND.

509
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:09,101
>> WHERE?

510
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,770
GOING AROUND, GOING AROUND,

511
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,270
GOING AROUND.

512
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:30,189
>> WE NEED TO WALK PAST.

513
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:36,996
>> PEOPLE TAKE THEIR PROCESSIONS

514
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:37,897
VERY SERIOUSLY HERE AND AREN'T

515
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:39,131
EXACTLY ACCOMMODATING TO ANYONE

516
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:42,334
WHO THREATENS TO BLOCK THE VIEW.

517
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:54,013
>> THAT WAS AMAZING, RIGHT?

518
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:58,484
>> THAT MUSIC.

519
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,586
>> FINALLY, BAR NUMBER TWO.

520
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:00,820
OLIVER.

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,189
THIS PLACE IS ALWAYS PACKED.

522
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:03,890
BEER, PLEASE.

523
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:09,361
AND WITH IT COMES A DELIGHTFUL

524
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,029
TAPA OF MUSSELS SEEMED IN BUTTER

525
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:10,997
AND OLIVE OIL.

526
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:12,665
>> THAT'S A GREAT TAPA.

527
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:13,833
THIS IS WHAT'S DIFFERENT.

528
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,267
PEOPLE COME IN HERE AND THEY

529
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:16,769
WILL EAT LIKE THIS PERFECTLY

530
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,436
HAPPY.

>> THE GLASS OF WINE COMES WITH

535
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,283
FRIED EGGPLANT AND CURRY.

536
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,852
MORE WINE FOLLOWED BY THESE

537
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:33,886
DELICIOUS LITTLE CLAMS.

538
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:37,423
AND THE MAIN EVENT.

539
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:40,693
>> NOW WE ARE TALKING.

540
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,729
THESE ARE NOT TAPAS AND

541
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:43,863
CONSEQUENTLY NOT FREE.

542
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:49,702
BUT WORTH IT AT ANY PRICE.

543
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:52,638
>> THAT'S SO TOTALLY AWESOME.

544
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,707
WE DID GOOD WORK HERE.

545
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,275
>> SHOULD WE GO ON?

546
00:27:56,275 --> 00:28:05,384
>> NO, LET'S MOVE ON.

547
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,119
>> AS THIS DEATH MARCH OF TAPAS

548
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,554
CONTINUES, THINGS START TO GET A

549
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:08,921
LITTLE WEIRD.

550
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,389
THIS IS THE STORY OF MY LIFE.

551
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:13,292
HE DOESN'T DO THIS AT HOME?

552
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,226
>> NO.

553
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,828
NOW I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.

554
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:16,729
>> YES.

555
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:17,629
>> EVERY DAY.

556
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:18,630
>> GOOD.

557
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:18,898
FINALLY.

558
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:22,468
A LITTLE EMPATHY.

559
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:25,905
I DO LIKE THE INCREASINGLY

560
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:27,006
META-ASPECT OF THIS SHOW.

561
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,776
I SHOULD REALLY BE LIVE

562
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:30,176
SCREENING.

563
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:34,947
THAT WOULD REALLY BE

564
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:35,281
INTERESTING.

565
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:39,585
FINALLY, JUST BAR GALLADO.

566
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:40,652
JUST MAKING IT.

567
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,088
WE'VE HAD A LOT TO EAT AND DRINK

568
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:43,089
AT THIS POINT.

569
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,992
SOME RESTRAINT NEEDS TO BE

570
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:46,525
SHOWN.

571
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:47,493
DUDE, FRIED FISH.

572
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:48,427
LITTLE ONES.

573
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,462
>> THEN WE'RE TALKING.

574
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,463
>> AND CHEESE.

575
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,265
>> BUT INSTEAD, THREE MORE

576
00:28:53,265 --> 00:29:01,941
BEERS, THREE MORE TAPAS.

577
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:02,308
BABY LAMB CHOPS.

578
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,442
>> THESE ARE SUPER GOOD.

579
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,478
>> THESE ARE SUPER GOOD.

580
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,646
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA

581
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:08,447
OF SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.

582
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:12,184
>> IT'S NOT SOMETHING FOR

583
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,119
NOTHING.

584
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,620
>> IF SOMEBODY CAN GET DEMAND

585
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,689
FOR IT IN THE U.S., THIS WILL

586
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,792
TAKE OFF.

587
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:20,126
>> NO, NEVER.

588
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:20,827
>> REALLY?

589
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:23,629
>> YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TAPAS

590
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:24,030
CULTURE.

591
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,964
YOU'RE LOOKING TO CHANGE THE

592
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,732
ENTIRE DAY, FROM THE MINUTE YOU

593
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:27,800
GET UP IN AMERICA.

594
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,467
NOT IN THE AFTERNOON.

595
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,804
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

596
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:33,639
>> I WANT TO WALK TO MY BAR, I

597
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,907
WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE BEER.

598
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:41,347
>> I WANT A GOLDEN UNICORN.

599
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:42,481
BOTH OF THOSE SCENARIOS ARE

600
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,450
EQUALLY LIKELY.

601
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:54,894
>>> EVERY STORYBOOK KINGDOM

602
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,495
NEEDS A CASTLE.

603
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:59,832
GRANADA, IT'S GOT A GOOD ONE.

604
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:03,269
ONE OF THE MOST ENCHANTED,

605
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,370
INSCRUTABLE, MADDENINGLY

606
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,737
BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURES EVER

607
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,906
CREATED BY MAN.

608
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:10,242
BUILT ON TOP OF NINTH CENTURY

609
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,078
FORTIFICATIONS AND ADDED TO AND

610
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,779
ADDED TO AS HISTORY UNFOLDED

611
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,882
THROUGH WARS AND TRAGEDY AND

612
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:19,751
INVASION AND CONQUEST.

613
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,287
>> IT'S VERY BARE.

614
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,522
ALL YOU SEE ARE THE TINY

615
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:23,789
WINDOWS.

616
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:39,105
AND IT'S PROJECTING IING IMP

617
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:39,471
IMPENATRABILITY.

618
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:42,041
ZACK IS A CINEMATOGRAPHER, SO

619
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,209
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT

620
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,244
MIGHT GET A GRIP ON A GUY WHOSE

621
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:46,778
PROFESSION IS THE INTRICATE PLAY

622
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:50,883
BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS.

623
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:53,385
>> TRYING TO WEAVE NATURE,

624
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:54,486
CALLIGRAPHY, SYMBOLS.

625
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:57,089
THESE ARE ALL INSCRIPTIONS,

626
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:02,494
TURNED INTO GRAPHICS.

627
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,896
>> DEPICT WORDS FROM GOD.

628
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:06,732
>> YES, BUT WHAT YOU CAN DEPICT,

629
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,134
AND THIS IS WHAT THIS ENTIRE

630
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:14,773
PLACE IS, IS GEOMETRIC SYSTEMS.

631
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:30,089
>> YES.

632
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,591
>> WHEN THE NASRI DYNASTY LIVED

633
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,994
HERE, IT WAS A HARMONIOUS SPACE

634
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,595
WHERE LIGHT, SHADE, WATER, THE

635
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,497
TRANSIT OF THE MOON AND STARS

636
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,432
WERE HARNESSED AND GLORIFIED.

637
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,867
>> I THINK THE BEST ASSUMPTION

638
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:42,801
IS NOTHING IS RANDOM.

639
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,972
THEY CAME HERE AND LAID OUT

640
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:50,042
EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO --

641
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,377
>> A PLAN.

642
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:52,778
IT WAS A PLACE FOR REFLECTION.

643
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,513
EACH ELEMENT OF DESIGN

644
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,148
PRESUMABLY INTENDED TO HAVE

645
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:59,685
EFFECTS BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND

646
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:00,052
RELIGIOUS.

647
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:03,122
>> IT'S REALLY A

648
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:05,624
CINEMATOGRAPHER'S PARADISE.

649
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:08,294
EVERYTHING IS ABOUT LIGHT AND

650
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:08,527
MAN.

651
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,662
EVERYTHING IS FRAMING FOR THEM.

652
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,298
>> HOW LONG DID IT TAKE THEM TO

653
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:12,631
BUILD THIS?

654
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,833
>> HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

655
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,235
>> THAT'S WHY IT TAKES SO LONG

656
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:18,137
FOR YOU TO GET THE SHOT?

657
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,672
>> OH, SNAP.

658
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:24,343
>> IN THE BUILDERS TIME,

659
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,911
ASTRONOMIES, MATHEMATICIANS WERE

660
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:28,647
LIKE PRIESTS, POSSESSORS OF

661
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,382
DIVINE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE

662
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:30,816
UNIVERSE WORKED.

663
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,651
DID THEY WANT TO CONTEMPLATE

664
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,186
NATURE OR CONQUER IT, CONTROL

665
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:34,353
IT?

666
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,921
>> THEY WERE CERTAINLY TRYING TO

667
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:36,655
EMULATE IT.

668
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,490
THEIR MATHEMATICS WERE TRYING TO

669
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,159
FIGURE OUT HOW NATURE WORKED,

670
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,260
PARTICULARLY THE SQUARE ROOTS

671
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,430
AND THE REPETITION OF PATTERN.

672
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,566
>> THEY SAW MATHEMATICAL

673
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:48,167
PATTERNS IN THE SKY AND ON

674
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,768
EARTH, THE WAY WATER MOVED AND

675
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,837
RIPPLED, THE WAY THINGS GREW,

676
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:54,906
THE SIMPLE PINE CONE, A FERN, A

677
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:55,907
POMEGRANATE, AND THEY THOUGHT

678
00:32:55,907 --> 00:33:00,679
ABOUT THE BASIC TRUTHS THESE

679
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,181
THINGS MIGHT REPRESENT.

680
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,350
>> THESE SYMMETRIES CAN ALL BE

681
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,784
SHUFFLED, SPUN ON ANY POINT AND

682
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:06,785
THEY ALIGN AGAIN WITH

683
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:07,086
THEMSELVES.

684
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,355
SO IF YOU STRETCHED THEM OUT,

685
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:11,523
FOR THEM THEY POINTED TO

686
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:12,024
INFINI

687
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:12,291
INFINITY.

688
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:12,924
>> WE WILL UNDERSTAND ALL

689
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:13,192
THINGS.

690
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:16,528
>> THROUGH CONTEMPLATING SACRED

00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,265
GEE OK TOMETRY

692
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:19,531
GEOMETRY.

693
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,100
>> HOW DID NATURE UNFOLD,

694
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,900
PATTERN ITSELF?

695
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,635
COULD THE BASIC DESIGNS OF

696
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,871
NATURE, EVEN IF DIVINE, BE

697
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:26,505
REPLICATED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT

698
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,040
STRUCTURE?

699
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,042
THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE

700
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,978
RIDDLE OF GOD HERE.

701
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:38,016
>> EXACTLY.

702
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,793
>>> AN HOUR'S DRIVE FROM

703
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,028
GRANADA, THE MEDITERRANEAN.

704
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,763
UNLIKE MUCH OF SPAIN'S COASTLINE

705
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,532
RUINED BY REAL ESTATE

706
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:27,633
SPECULATORS AND OVERDEVELOPMENT,

707
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,300
THE COAST AROUND HERE IS LARGELY

708
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,203
UNSPOILED.

709
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:34,039
I'M ON MY WAY TO A MORAGA, A

>> SPAIN IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.

729
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:34,933
WE'RE NOT EVEN EATING YET AND

730
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,067
IT'S GOOD.

>> WANT MASS.

733
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,109
THAT IS LIKE THE BEST THING IN

CHOCOLATE.

739
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,722
THIS IS THE CHOCOLATE OF THE

740
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:57,055
GODS.

LOOK AT THAT.

00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,255
A LOT OF FAT.
