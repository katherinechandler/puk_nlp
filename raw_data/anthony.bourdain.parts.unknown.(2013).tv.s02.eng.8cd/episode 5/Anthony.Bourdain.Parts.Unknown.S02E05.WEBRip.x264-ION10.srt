This incredible town.

It goes back to
the 12th century.

People trudge up the hill to the

00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:25,558
beautiful church to take the

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:31,298
walk that Michael Corleone took.

7
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:32,732

"the godfather" theme park where

place whose roots are very much

30
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,747
the roots of the town where I

31
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:55,549
live, but somehow I've never

32
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,918
been able to get it right.

33
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:02,054
To tell the story,
any story of Sicily.

34
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,024
It's the biggest island
in the Mediterranean Ann.

35
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,895
Two main towns of Palermo and

36
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,530
Catania on opposite sides.

37
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,333
I'm done a show in
Palermo before.

38
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:17,870
It was an goat rodeo, an
epic of humiliating scale.

39
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,407
This time I was going
to get it right.

40
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:22,041
There's the Sicily we know from

41
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,344
films, an evocative, deeply felt

42
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,413
history that's not quite reality

43
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:28,448
but cool anyway, right?

44
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,250
There's the simple fact of its

45
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,518
location, tucked away under the

46
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,220
boot of Italy, part of but not

47
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:38,191
really part of that country.

48
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,092
Its own language, culture, its

49
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:45,198
own history of Norman, Arab,
Spanish, Roman, Turkish,

50
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,436
Egyptian interlopers, all
leaving their Mark and their

51
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:49,703
influence.

52
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:53,206
I grew up in New Jersey which

53
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,374
was pretty much
Sicily on the Hudson.

54
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,042
The Italian-Americans next door

55
00:02:56,043 --> 00:03:00,280
weren't from Milan, I
could tell you that much.

56
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,215
I guess what I'm telling you is

57
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:08,221
I figured this will be easy.

58
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:16,222
Villa Moraci, a certified hotel,

59
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,999
working farm that in this
case produces olive oil.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,402
How many acres of
property do you have?

61
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,304
About 40 acres.

62
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:27,840
One of the oldest
organic farm mountains.

63
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:32,845
This is Guido, the proprietor.

64
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,013
Wow.

65
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:36,182
So that's where
potatoes come from.

66
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,850
How freakin' hard can it be to

67
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,687
make an awesome show in Sicily?

68
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:44,591
Eat the nice food,
drink the wine.

69
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:47,627
In an idyllic village in the

70
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:48,928
countryside, outside Catania.

71
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:55,167
How low impact can it get?

72
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,170
So the plan was we go fishing.

73
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,974
We get some fresh octopus, maybe

74
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,810
some cuttlefish and explore the

75
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,812
bounties of surrounding waters,

76
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:06,979
all while working on our tans.

77
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,719
With a local chef,
fishermen, man of the sea.

78
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,886
He's experienced.

79
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,688
He knows where to get it good.

80
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,357
You like the ocean?

81
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,291
I love it.

82
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:19,526
How do you see it in Italian?

83
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,494
Ricci.

84
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:25,998
One of my favorite
things to eat.

85
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:31,203
This is Turin, my host.

86
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:31,839
Who else is out this octopus?

87
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,808
It's cuttlefish and I want to

88
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:43,809
try to find some apalone and the

89
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,518
bucce and small clams.

90
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,354
I think they will
be really full.

91
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,522
I'm thinking really?

92
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,724
Are these prime fishing waters?

93
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,925
I don't know about this.

94
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,093
All the boat traffic and all

95
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,195
these people and so close to the

96
00:04:56,196 --> 00:05:00,667
action I can't see much of
anything living down there.

97
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,069
Okay.

98
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,904
We anchor here.

99
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:07,940
But I am famous for my
optimism so I dutifully suited

100
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:15,941
up for what was advertised
as a three-hour cruise.

101
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:23,923
So I get in the water,
and I'm paddling around.

102
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,191
And splash.

103
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,360
Suddenly there's a dead sea

104
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:31,698
creature sinking slowly so
the seabed in front of me.

105
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:32,965
Are they kidding me?

106
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,034
I'm thinking can
this be happening?

107
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:39,439
Splash, another rigor mortis

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,542
half-frozen freakin'
octopus but it goes on.

109
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,211
One dead cuttlefish, octopus,

110
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,046
frozen sea urchin after another,

111
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,715
splash, splash, splash.

112
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,550
Each specimen drops among the

113
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,986
rocks or along the sea floor, to

114
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,656
be heroically discovered and

115
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,890
proudly shown off to camera,

116
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,992
like I'm not actually washing as

117
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,729
the confederate in the next boat

118
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:09,769
over hurls them into the
water one after another.

119
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,938
I'm no marine biologist, but I

120
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,507
know dead octopus
when I sea one.

121
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,642
Pretty sure they don't drop from

122
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,644
the sky and sink
straight to the bottom.

123
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,679
How many do we have?

124
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,147
Three?

125
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:21,180
Yeah.

126
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:21,582
Okay.

127
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:29,583
I tried to get some patate
now and also small abalone.

128
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,359
Strangely everyone believes
the hideous sham unfolding

129
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,327
before our eyes, Doug our best

130
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,832
to ignore the
blindingly obvious.

131
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,668
Don't swim at it.

132
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,135
Then they gave up and dumped

133
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:51,136
the whole bag of dead
fish into the sea.

134
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,883
At this point I begin desperately
looking for signs of

135
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,551
life, hoping that one of them

136
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,821
would stir, become revived.

137
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,022
I'm frantically swimming around

138
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,624
the bottom littered with dead

139
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,858
things looking for one that's

140
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,293
still twitching so can I hold it

141
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,195
up to the camera and end this

142
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:15,635
misery, but, no, my
shame will be absolute.

143
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,369
For some reason I feel something

144
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,206
snap, and I slide quickly into a

145
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:23,676
spiral of near
hysterical depression.

146
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,712
Is this what it's come to, I'm

147
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,680
thinking, as another dead squid

148
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,848
narrowly misses my head?

149
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,483
Almost a decade later back in

150
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,685
the same country, and I'm still

151
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,722
desperately staging fishing

152
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,824
scenes, creeding the oceans with

153
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:38,891
supermarket seafood, complicit

154
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:43,162
in a shameful, shameful
incident of fakery.

155
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:48,501
But there I was, bobbing
liftlessly in the water.

156
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:52,171
Dead sea life sinking to
the bottom all around me.

157
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,573
You've got to be pretty immune

158
00:07:53,574 --> 00:08:01,574
to the world to not see some
kind of obvious metaphor.

159
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,758
I've never had anerrious

160
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,025
breakdown before, but I tell you

161
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,761
from the bottom of my heart

162
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:15,862
something took part down there,

163
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,463
and it took a long, long time

164
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:25,464
after the end of this
damn episode to recover.

165
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:44,750
♪

166
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,504
No need to boil.

167
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:02,275
We'll be ready without it.

168
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:29,669
Raw clams, abalone and a
heart-warming beet scene

169
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,204
surrounded with a
gaggle of curious kids.

170
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,875
It was at this point time
for Ture to redeem himself.

171
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,109
You'll notice, I'm not there.

172
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,511
I'm sitting in a nearby cafe

173
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,649
pounding one negrone after in a

174
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,285
smouldering miserable rage.

175
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,688
Our evening meal will be at

176
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,023
Ture's place which is just up

177
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:55,027
the hill in Turmina, but by the

178
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:59,131
time dinner is near, I'm ripped

179
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,334
to the... did I mention
it's my birthday?

180
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,502
Are couple hours on a boat, a

181
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,071
couple more hours getting looped

182
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,039
and a couple more hours on the

183
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,741
restaurant so I'm
gone, baby, gone.

184
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,542
So I don't remember any of this.

185
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,545
Any of it.

186
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,214
So how is your day today?

187
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,482
Good.

188
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,684
A nice boat trip.

189
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:18,485
A little swim.

190
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,920
I would be told later that a

191
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:24,924
gentleman named Tomaso joined me

192
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,225
for dinner and also someone on

193
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,027
the crusade his wife was present

194
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,595
and she didn't say much.

195
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,363
Preferably because this wasn't

196
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,499
her preferred way to
spend her birthday.

197
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:33,734
Hi.

198
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,234
Tony.

199
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,202
This is my passion.

200
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:38,738
I like to find the old variety

201
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,840
of olive, and one
of this is white.

202
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,074
So that's original.

203
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:42,409
Original.

204
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,010
You don't find it anyplace else.

205
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,712
Apparently there were these

206
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:48,447
white olives harvested from some

207
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,216
secret tree only
Ture knows about.

208
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:53,019
Maybe it's next to his
secret fishing hole.

209
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,954
There was great Sicilian wine

210
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,224
apparently, and apparently
I drank quite a lot of it.

211
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,127
There was bread and olive oil,

212
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,797
abalone served raw in the shell,

213
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,933
baby sardine, also served raw

214
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:11,237
with a splash of
citrus and salt.

215
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:14,974
And this is the baby sardine,

216
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,575
totally raw without no match

217
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:20,212
ingredients to taste
better the fish.

218
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:20,447
Salud.

219
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:21,981
Thank you.

220
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:26,719
If you ask a Sicilian, right,
say where you come from?

221
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,956
The correct answer
should be I'm Italian.

222
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:30,390
Right.

223
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,725
We say I'm Sicilian.

224
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,160
Is Sicily, Italy?

225
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:34,661
Yes.

226
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:35,762
Should it be?

227
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:39,665
I don't know, but we used to

228
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,968
have influence from Britains,

229
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:46,238
Normans, Arab, Spanish, so
basically we are a mix.

230
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,975
We're a blender.

231
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:50,642
Oh, look, my octopus.

232
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,745
I remember personally
catching that one.

233
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,481
It was a mighty struggle, too.

234
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,484
No, actually I don't.

235
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,319
Octopus.

236
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,621
Pretty, beautiful little shrimp.

237
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,957
Very tender, the
octopus, very nice.

238
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,293
And another traditional
specialty.

239
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:12,031
I'm told they call
this tuna tartar.

240
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:17,503
And cuttlefish, recognize
you, my friend.

241
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,572
How traditional is
this to Sicily?

242
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,209
I think from the part of the

243
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,276
sea they almost eat a roll.

244
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:24,677
Yes.

245
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,213
But fish every one men only,

246
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,648
fishing communities
only or in restaurants.

247
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,317
If no.

248
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:33,185
Always as long as you could

249
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,455
arude, you see crudo like this?

250
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,224
I see it in poor families.

251
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,961
The Japanese sort of gave
everybody permission to eat

252
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,163
traditional foods, their
own traditional foods.

253
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:48,467
What are the great mother
Sicilian classic dishes?

254
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:52,138
The anchovy.

255
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:57,343
Anchovy and parmegiana.

256
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,544
That's with the sardine.

257
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:05,918
But it's an explosion of
flower, because it's Arab.

258
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,921
Born in the period when
Sicily was very poor.

259
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,022
This I like.

260
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:17,329
I even remember it.

261
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,431
Pasta, a true Sicilian classic

262
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,869
made with fennel, pine
nuts, saffron and anchovy.

263
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,337
Served alongside some par dines

264
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,673
that have been curing in
chestnuts and salt for days,

265
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,075
then lightly fried in oil.

266
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:34,013
We have to use our hand, use
our hand to eat the fish.

267
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,348
No problem.

268
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,284
I must have shrunk back to bed

269
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:42,088
somehow, collapsed in a sodden

270
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,190
drunken heap of self-loathing.

271
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,125
I normally would have turned on

272
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,794
the porn challenge and turned on

273
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:54,034
the TV but there is no
TV at the agri tourismo.

274
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:06,145
>I love the films "godfather

275
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,380
1" and "godfather 2" but they

276
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,917
had nothing to do with any
organized crime from opera.

277
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,718
They are opera, magnificent on

278
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:16,155
race, but basically a morality
tale about toilety and

279
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:16,924
destroying the things that you

280
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:23,395
claim to love and
want to protect.

281
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,797
Actual organized crime members

282
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,599
and literally speaking a bunch

283
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,169
of lazy ass sociopaths who have

284
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,603
no problem stealing from their

285
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,139
own harder working neighbors.

286
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,609
Here in Sicily they are
interested and less glamorous

287
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,278
than gambling and prostitution.

288
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,479
They have and traditionally have

289
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,649
been a gigantic parasitical

290
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,850
organization, one that has now

291
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:50,489
grown to be of mere
equal size as its host.

292
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,590
Mary is originally from new

293
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,092
York, but she's been living here

294
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,427
in Palermo for half
a century now.

295
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,629
She's a food writer and at one

296
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,999
time a reformer for social

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,204
justice which is a dicey
thing to be here.

298
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:08,607
You've been here all this time?

299
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:08,775
Why?

300
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,776
Well, I came for a year.

301
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,479
It was going to be a year
between college and graduate

302
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:13,713
school.

303
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:16,682
I just finished college.

304
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:23,956
I met a man, and
therein lies the why.

305
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:27,859
I mayor aid Sicilian and
have been here ever since.

306
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,129
Piccolo Napoli, a restaurant

307
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,164
that's been here for a lot of

308
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,366
years and is known for
the quality of its food.

309
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,535
Tell me about where
we are, first of all.

310
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,237
The father and mother of the

311
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,239
present owner opened this in

312
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,907
1951 when there was a wonderful

313
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:45,911
photograph there on the
wall of the opening day.

314
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,247
It started as a tavern and has

315
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,216
become a well-known and much

316
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,517
appreciated restaurant now.

317
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:52,884
It's very straightforward

318
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:58,024
Sicilian cooking at its best.

319
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,725
We start with some typical

320
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,527
things, the kind of things I

321
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:02,928
deeply love, the kind of simple

322
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,865
good things that make me happy.

323
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,167
Panelli which is a fritter made

324
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,669
from chickpeas, cap nata, a

325
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,571
sweet and sour eggplant dish,

326
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,707
kind of like rat actually and a

327
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,609
plate of olives and white wine

328
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,677
produced from a small batch

329
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,413
vineyard run by Mary
and her husband.

330
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,116
This is a panelli?

331
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,517
Chickpea flour that comes in

332
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,419
with the Arabs, maybe even

333
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,454
earlier, because chickpeas have

334
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,689
been around for a long time.

335
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,791
And this is the fame out cap

336
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:38,297
nata and about Assisi
asilian as it gets.

337
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:42,968
Capanat and cannoli are the

338
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:47,039
two well known Sicilian dishes.

339
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,475
This is what I've
been waiting for.

340
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,477
This is what I wanted Sicily to

341
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,746
be, something to soothe
my shattered soul.

342
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,616
It doesn't take much,
a bowl of good pasta.

343
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:05,617
In this case the famous
spaghetti Al Nero Di sepia,

344
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,395
spaghetti and cuttlefish and

345
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:14,933
pasta with swordfish,
eggplant and tomatoes.

346
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:20,272
Oh, beautiful.

347
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:20,807
Perfect.

348
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:21,641
Perfect pasta.

349
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,809
Very happy with that.

350
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,344
Good.

351
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:25,644
I know you've been looking

352
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:31,983
forward to it so I'm
glad it's good.

353
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,486
It's an expensive city for some

354
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,623
things because the
consumer is paying.

355
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:37,890
More.

356
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,660
More so that the store can
afford to pay its extortion

357
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,028
money.

358
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,862
The big change that has happened

359
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,698
is that up until the mid-'80s,

360
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,467
the late '80s, there were a

361
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,102
great many Sicilians who thought

362
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,537
if they were honest and didn't

363
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,505
have anything to do with the

364
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,307
mafia, they could live without

365
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:58,043
being affected by the mafia.

366
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,179
Apparently 80% of the businesses

367
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,615
in Palermo and 70% in the rest

368
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,185
of Italy that pay extortion.

369
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:06,653
That's a lot.

370
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:07,853
That's a lot.

371
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,156
But not everybody pays the bite.

372
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:11,990
A small but growing coalition of

373
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:16,995
businesses have joined a group,

374
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:19,798
a grass roots organization
taking a stand against the

375
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,667
mafia's traditional mere total

376
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,336
control over the food
chain, from farm to table.

377
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,738
I come out of the restaurant
business in New York.

378
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,475
You got taxed with every laundry

379
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,977
order every time they
took your trash away.

380
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,147
It was built in to all
your basic services.

381
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,749
Here it's much
more going around.

382
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,651
Christmas and Easter.

383
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:39,652
Guy comes by.

384
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,487
The guy comes by.

385
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,388
It's plain and simple extortion.

386
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,356
Given that that's a pretty

387
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,657
straightforward situation, some

388
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,494
of these guys who banded

389
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,895
together, what happens, the guy

390
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,030
shows up and says
I'm not paying you.

391
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,999
What happens next?

392
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,602
Well, apparently now the

393
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:59,505
mafia has decided that it isn't

394
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,273
worthwhile bothering with the

395
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:03,041
people who belong to the group.

396
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,276
There's so many others out there

397
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,212
and why look for trouble.

398
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,279
How true it is, I don't know.

399
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,047
Right.

400
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:09,581
To belong to the group, you

401
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,717
have to sign a pledge that you

402
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,953
will not pay and that if you are

403
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,523
approached, will you
go to the police.

404
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:17,790
Right.

405
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:18,857
Then they send you to lawyers

406
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,692
and to another organization

407
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:21,793
which deals with the people who

408
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,630
are actually having trouble.

409
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,097
It's incredibly complicated.

410
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:30,769
I mean, there are
no easy answers.

411
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,604
Right.

412
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,240
What about big farm?

413
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,774
What about some of the things

414
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,943
that are... that are happening

415
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,145
on a much more legitimate level?

416
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,948
I mean, who is more
destructive worldwide?

417
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,617
You can make a very
good argument.

418
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,785
That's horrible.

419
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,720
I'm upset because I sound as if

420
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,156
I'm making apologies
for the mafia.

421
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,558
It's just I think what has

422
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,059
happened, that having lived 50

423
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,328
years in Sicily, I'm much more

424
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,429
skeptical than most Americans.

425
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:57,964
Right.

426
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:00,299
I don't know.

427
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,633
I know what you're saying.

428
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,102
You're saying you're not so sure

429
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,672
that a mafia-free Italy would be

430
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,574
that much more functional?

431
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,575
Absolutely.

432
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,142
I'm not so sure.

433
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,444
I'm not so sure at all.

434
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,680
But I am constantly amused by

435
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:17,583
the fact that 45 years ago, if I

436
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:20,151
said to Americans, oh, I live in

437
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,187
sissy, Sicily, how did a nice

438
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,623
girl like you end up
in a place like that?

439
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,991
Really.

440
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,328
Now it's oh, on a farm
in Sicily, how romantic.

441
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,263
Oh, I envy you.

442
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:34,666
So perception of Sicily
it has changed.

443
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,802
It has changed.

444
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:40,472
In 2007 there were only 160

445
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,974
group members, and now over 800.

446
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,009
Pretty cool considering we're

447
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,877
talking about a group who have

448
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,146
demonstrated no regret or

449
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:54,886
hesitation in killing judges,
politicians, police,

450
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:58,156
prosecutors.

451
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,992
Back to Catania, and when you're

452
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:05,030
talking late-night dining
options, you're talking one

453
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:08,367
thing, the enticing smell of
smoke wafting through the

454
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:11,837
streets, a smell that's
enticingly equine.

455
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:15,641
I smell rainbow dash.

456
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:20,145
Yes, yes.

457
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:20,347
Yes.

458
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:24,350
Anthony and Marco, a couple

459
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:31,857
of Sicilians and aficionados.

460
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,360
This is one of the older

461
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:38,263
side, famous, you know, families

462
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:41,433
of mafia that grows in
crime organization here.

463
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,234
Oh, right here?

464
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:43,835
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

465
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:47,606
Nowadays seems to be like a

466
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,341
bit more quiet because they are

467
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,343
all getting arrested so they

468
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:59,017
prefer to sell meat
against drugs.

469
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:02,020
So right over there you
can bet on a horse.

470
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,455
We can bet horses, yes.

471
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:06,958
Bet horses, and here you
eat the one that lose.

472
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,394
Right.

473
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:10,962
The loser goes on the fire.

474
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,131
That's not a nice thing, but, I

475
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,634
mean, sometimes it
happens for real.

476
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:18,770
Cycle of life.

477
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:22,441
All right.

478
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:23,442
So why horse?

479
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:27,979
Where does this
tradition come from?

480
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,715
Maybe also Egyptians and then

481
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:32,183
we have Greeks, 750
years before Christ.

482
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,053
Then we have Romans.

483
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:35,655
Because?

484
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:42,093
We have to say is I
asilians are big bastards.

485
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,563
Of course, we're being
conquered by everybody.

486
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:45,731
Also our dialect.

487
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,132
There are many words that are

488
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,434
understood by other people.

489
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:52,270
If I say is I asilian dialect
word, maybe an Arab can

490
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:55,006
understand me, and the Italian

491
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,742
language comes from Latin,
something different.

492
00:22:56,743 --> 00:23:02,414
We are Sicilians before
Italians, remember this.

493
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:10,415
I'll never forget.

494
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,960
Look at this side of the meat.

495
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,295
It's yellow, it's not white.

496
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:21,299
When it's yellow, it means that

497
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,300
the horse has been
eating fresh grass.

498
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:43,856
Prepare and go.

499
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,023
You like the faith?

500
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:45,692
It's good.

501
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:47,025
It's a bit sweet.

502
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:50,228
You don't need nothing.

503
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,130
Horse meat.

504
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:55,967
Loved by quite everybody
here, you know.

505
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,904
Dewith have it for meat balls,

506
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,839
and we can have a
horse meat ball.

507
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,474
As you wish.

508
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,309
I'll try anything.

509
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,313
Make some different
things, you know.

510
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:11,850
Bread, Parmesan
cheese, pecorino.

511
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:12,151
Right.

512
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:17,155
Parsley, eggs, and,
of course, horse.

513
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:17,657
Horse.

514
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:19,491
It is very tasty.

515
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,527
Let's put it this way.

516
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,895
When my daughter asks me for a

517
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:27,032
pony, I'm bringing her here and

518
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:30,803
asking for a grill and
saying here is your pony.

519
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:47,085
>This national park and
within a free range pig farm.

520
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:52,057
They breed special heritage
pigs here, the black boar.

521
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:55,561
A combination of wild Sicilian

522
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:56,195
boar and domesticated swine

523
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,129
thought to be brought here from

524
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,730
Spain long ago, this breed of

525
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:04,736
pig is raising the
profile of the pig here.

526
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:08,306
It's every we are.

527
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:12,611
Look, look, here now, the noise.

528
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:15,547
They will arrive.

529
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:15,848
Fantastica.

530
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,918
Like any good-tasting
high-quality pig, the secret is

531
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,887
largely what were they fed?

532
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:22,888
How did they live?

533
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:27,325
Were they happy?

534
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,127
I'm a hunter.

535
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,796
I've never seen so many in once.

536
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:36,401
It's like I feel... you
should be shooting something.

537
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:36,669
Yeah.

538
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,238
A poorly fed pig who lived

539
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,573
his life in squalor, stress and

540
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,008
fear makes for bad pork.

541
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,076
This is why we should treat

542
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,845
animals well, not just because

543
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,413
that's the nice thing to do, but

544
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:56,414
because it makes them
provably more delicious.

545
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,995
Chestnuts, acorns, roots and

546
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,264
stuff foraged from the hills,

547
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,499
supplemented by some nice
fattening grain during the

548
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,201
winter months when wild food is

549
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,638
less easy and less plentiful.

550
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:17,042
They catch here the animal.

551
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:17,443
Right.

552
00:26:17,444 --> 00:26:22,047
It's a shame that they
don't let you shoot.

553
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:23,882
I like pigs.

554
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,651
Not to hang out with, to eat.

555
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,485
I don't have a tattoo of a pig

556
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,055
or anything, but I like them
fine, and when given the

557
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,556
opportunity to shoot one in the

558
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,058
brain or see one shot in the

559
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:38,229
brain so that I may suck on its

560
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,732
entrails and other
parts, I'm down.

561
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:44,670
That's what is called cheering
me up from some manic

562
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:44,971
depression.

563
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:52,410
Bang, and this pig is like
Pauly, you won't see him no

564
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,646
more.

565
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,381
Even with the brain dead, the

566
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:59,250
heart still goes on beating,

567
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,386
sort of like pick a Kardashian.

568
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:03,054
In the case, however, the last

569
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,156
few beats of the heart are

570
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,157
absolutely necessary to pump all

571
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:14,158
that red, red carve in a
bucket for sanguinacco.

572
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,711
Looking good.

573
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:29,580
There's a Kardashian
joke there somewhere.

574
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,549
Kim gets ready for the big day.

575
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:36,621
It's date night
at Khloe's house.

576
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:41,226
Veal housewife gets
ready for summer.

577
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:47,632
Grooming tips from
Theresa Guidice.

578
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:50,568
Let's hope Kanye never
has to see this.

579
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:56,041
We hang now.

580
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,042
Bye.

581
00:27:57,043 --> 00:28:01,146
Then get to work.

582
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:04,816
Okay.

583
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:07,552
Very fast.

584
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,087
All those good bits, the

585
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,624
lungs, kidneys, they get cooked

586
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,727
slowly in fat with garlic, chili

587
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,495
pepper, a little wine.

588
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:21,933
Is the meat also the liver?

589
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:29,934
All the interior with
a little bit of fat?

590
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,111
With a little bit of the fat.

591
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:35,847
It's a pork confit.

592
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:36,948
Oh, that's pretty.

593
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,817
Meanwhile the intestinal casings

594
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,585
get filled with blood and gently

595
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:45,791
poached until creamy
bloody delicious.

596
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,193
And a nice spread of homemade

597
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:52,964
cured meats, local cheese
and homemade wine.

598
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,866
Let the party begin.

599
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,335
So, what do we have here?

600
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:00,038
Let's identify these products.

601
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,873
Cap koala.

602
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:09,514
Capicola, prosciutto.

603
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:09,882
Pancetta.

604
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:13,384
Oh, that looks good.

605
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,521
The cheese is local, provolone.

606
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:20,959
This is the ricotta and
just cooked in the oven.

607
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,360
The bread.

608
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:25,563
The bread is from the ankle,

609
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,999
and they have also salami
and they have sausages.

610
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,037
And this cheese?

611
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:40,038
Cannistratsglo and what
do you call that dish?

612
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,984
Just in the pan.

613
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:53,985
Beautiful.

614
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,165
Oh, it's good.

615
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,067
Best moment of the day.

616
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:01,868
Indeed.

617
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:04,335
Oh, yeah.

618
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,770
What did you think about?

619
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,739
It's good.

620
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:15,413
For me the ricotta,
it's really good.

621
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:18,016
Here in Sicily, I expect that

622
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:19,717
very few people know this is

623
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,252
incredible, even the bread is

624
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,521
the old lady that she made.

625
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:24,023
Oh.

626
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,257
You think of Sicily, you think

627
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,558
of family, you think of food.

628
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:34,733
This is more like it.

629
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:05,330
We'll stop here for shrimp.

630
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,565
Catania, the early
morning market.

631
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:11,302
It's been going on for longer

632
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,303
than America has as a country.

633
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:16,942
It's old, old Italia.

634
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:18,843
Do they know you here?

635
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:22,113
Do you shop here often?

636
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:22,414
Yeah.

637
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:24,950
This is not Tomaso's first

638
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,751
trip to the market
by a long shot.

639
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:28,119
His mom is a regular.

640
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,620
She comes here almost every day.

641
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,989
Thanks.

642
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,491
And this is the next stock
market you can find here

643
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:33,792
everything.

644
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:36,127
Each butcher, more likely they

645
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,096
have their own specialty.

646
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,865
Fresh ingredients, you know.

647
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:41,933
They do lamb.

648
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:49,708
Lamb, sauceage is and Hamburg

649
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:50,142
er.

650
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:52,377
This is at least six
months old, at least.

651
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:52,844
Over here.

652
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:55,380
This is the place where she buy

653
00:31:55,381 --> 00:32:03,381
the spices for her
home, and the veggies.

654
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:08,026
This is what the market is
best known for, seafood.

655
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:12,230
Bongiourno.

656
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,699
This one is one of the biggest

657
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,701
sellers that we have
in the fish market.

658
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:20,405
Can you see also the variety.

659
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,340
Yeah.

660
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:25,143
We consider the tuna like a pig.

661
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:29,380
We don't throw away anything.

662
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,082
See, this is typical.

663
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,217
You can find it here.

664
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:36,021
Oh, those are the tiny,
tiny little clams.

665
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:38,556
Right.

666
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,825
Yes.

667
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:48,826
You can see the shrimp
are still alive.

668
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,601
So I see sepia.

669
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:56,274
Yeah, baby sardines.

670
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:56,575
Swordfish.

671
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,177
I'm joining Tomaso
for lunch Tate.

672
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:04,382
Mom's cooking, so we've
got to do some shopping.

673
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:08,553
Bongiourno.

674
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:09,954
They look beautiful.

675
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:10,256
Yeah.

676
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:16,627
The color is beautiful.

677
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,964
And bongiourno.

678
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:25,936
So we'll go have some
today, so shrimp.

679
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,972
And baby sardines.

680
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:28,907
Gracias.

681
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:33,711
Bongiourno.

682
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:34,480
I'll tell you.

683
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:37,582
What do you want to try?

684
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:43,821
Blood sausage?

685
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:47,958
Just blood, no onion,
no spice, nothing?

686
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:48,827
A little salt.

687
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,061
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

688
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:52,130
Oh, a little pepper.

689
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:52,798
Si.

690
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,898
You squeeze it.

691
00:33:53,899 --> 00:34:01,899
No, no, no.

692
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:15,186
Oh, man.

693
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,122
Interesting runner up.

694
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:17,789
Oh, that's good.

695
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:23,128
Usually I don't like it
plain, like it in a sauce and

696
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:23,329
spicy.

697
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,631
That's very tasty.

698
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,166
Looks like hell.

699
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,300
Tastes like heaven.

700
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:32,137
If you like this,
you're Sicilian.

701
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:38,610
Very, very.

702
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,899
>I don't have any grandparents.

703
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,234
My mom, I guess she cooks, but

704
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,635
last time she ever invited me

705
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,205
for dinner was like 1972 so

706
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,474
given that dysfunctional, tragic

707
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:12,810
too much kind of history is it

708
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,846
any mystery why I'm on
the lookout for grandma?

709
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,582
Anybody's grandmother's
would do.

710
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:21,819
I've been known to hitch-hike
highways looking for any

711
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,688
grannies and given my fragile

712
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:26,090
emotional sense it makes sense

713
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:30,728
that I would dragoon Tomaso's

714
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,898
mom into making me a lunch.

715
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,534
Is that intriguing or sad?

716
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:39,937
Smells good in here.

717
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:40,206
Cheers.

718
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,207
Cheers.

719
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,341
Need any help chopping parsley?

720
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,876
Oh, perfect.

721
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,212
For lunch we've got the shrimp

722
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:49,780
and sardines from earlier at the

723
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,949
market, but first this.

724
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,351
Just grab one?

725
00:35:53,352 --> 00:36:01,352
It's like arancini but with
hole owed out potatoes.

726
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:07,598
Basically, and with
all the cheese.

727
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,570
And deep in and sealed the
potatoes and then fried.

728
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:19,644
My mother cooks for
everybody, even if it was

729
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,612
so when we have to share all

730
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:22,780
together and have a dinner, my

731
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:25,783
mother is cooking for everybody.

732
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:27,718
Because the problem is when she

733
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,120
cook, even if she know it's only

734
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,156
for five people, she
cooking for ten.

735
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:40,157
Just in case.

736
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:45,069
This is Sicily, after all.

737
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,504
This is the classic starter.

738
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:48,573
Also a bread and tomato salad.

739
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,875
Would you like to try something?

740
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:57,982
That's old school.

741
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,984
We use bread that a harder.

742
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:02,320
We usually do bread
that is two days old.

743
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,454
It's really good.

744
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:08,359
Really, really good.

745
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,927
That's Sicily right there.

746
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:09,194
Right.

747
00:37:09,195 --> 00:37:15,533
Yes.

748
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:18,536
Fresh shrimp sautes
in butter and garlic.

749
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:23,007
When they are confronted
with the shrimp, fry away.

750
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:29,046
That's the way you see
if it's fresh or not.

751
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,981
So typical day, when you were

752
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:37,488
15 years old what did
you eat for lunch?

753
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,391
Fish and pasta.

754
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:41,492
Basically you have to go right

755
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:44,795
behind the corner to
find your products.

756
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,964
Whatever we could produce in

757
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,400
Zitly, that's what
we choose to buy.

758
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,235
Watch this.

759
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:51,536
Zip the bone right out.

760
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:52,203
Out comes all the bone.

761
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:55,506
Who needs a knife?

762
00:37:55,507 --> 00:38:03,507
Sardines fileted neatly,
sauteed in garlic and oil.

763
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:12,857
I'll tell you, another two hours

764
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:14,825
here I'll be speaking Sicilian.

765
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:15,327
You have to eat it hot.

766
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:17,428
This is very nice.

767
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:25,429
If you don't like this,
there's no hope for you.

768
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:30,409
If you like it.

769
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:30,909
Tell her.

770
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,511
Happy.

771
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:34,380
This is a delicious meal.

772
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:36,747
And to eat in this beautiful

773
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:40,919
home with some really
good home cooked food.

774
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:58,135
>My last night in Sicily.

775
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,770
After this I'm calling in bed

776
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,407
and taking the fetal
position for six weeks.

777
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:05,142
I may look normal...
Okay, I don't exactly.

778
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:08,979
But I'm not barking or shrieking

779
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,817
with my pants wrapped around my

780
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,151
head which is what my instincts

781
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,953
are telling me I
should be doing.

782
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:19,156
One of life's great
joys is cheese.

783
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,825
No, I'm eating cheese.

784
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,993
Which makes me happy.

785
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:23,294
Always.

786
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:25,295
And drink wine.

787
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,664
Good wine.

788
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,833
And a hell of a lot of it.

789
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,669
I'll make it over the hump
with any luck at all.

790
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:39,670
We have a mozzarella
here, a pepperccino.

791
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,689
Tori joins me for a final meal.

792
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,424
This is not a concept that

793
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,826
exists in America, but it is a

794
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,361
concept that should exist.

795
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:02,099
Okay, now please
explain what it is.

796
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,836
A hotel linked to the territory.

797
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:13,644
Use local product, local recipe.

798
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:18,048
Penne, sun dried tomatoes
all from the farm.

799
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:26,049
Oh, man that looks good.

800
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:30,828
Wow.

801
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,163
Fantastic.

802
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,200
Some nice olive oil
also from the farm.

803
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:36,468
More wine.

804
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:41,472
I might just make it.

805
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:45,375
This is called agridolce.

806
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,410
It's bitter.

807
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:49,747
If you talk about Italy, it is

808
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:54,351
the most interesting
part of Italian cuisine.

809
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:55,385
Life is too good.

810
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,655
I need a little bitterness to

811
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:58,823
remind myself of the internal

812
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:01,158
tragedy of our existence.

813
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,662
The sweet and sour of the life.

814
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:07,498
One final attempt before I go

815
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:08,333
to extract something meaningful

816
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:11,201
on what it means to be Sicilian.

817
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,037
What's wrong with these
people in the north?

818
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:18,609
People from the south are

819
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,879
coming from these Greek culture

820
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,116
where the philosopher while in

821
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:29,587
the north came through and
that's the meanest thing

822
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:29,955
anyone can say.

823
00:41:29,956 --> 00:41:35,059
Oh.

824
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,062
And the last century, the

825
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:43,801
three best writers in
Italy are from Sicily.

826
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:46,971
Because they consider us
a weight like problems.

827
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:48,973
Yet in summers they
all come here.

828
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:53,310
It's a good thing
for us, you know?

829
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:58,549
In the end, it all comes
back to the godfather.

830
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,084
We go up this beautiful

831
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:02,386
mountain, this incredible town.

832
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:05,890
It goes back to
the 12th century.

833
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:09,560
There are few places on
earth more beautiful.

834
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:14,632
But we are sitting in one of

835
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:21,639
the... it was like a
godfather theme park.

836
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,276
You know, we just look at
people with the godfather

837
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:26,511
t-shirt.

838
00:42:26,512 --> 00:42:27,978
And say oh, my god.

839
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:34,451
Why people get stuck on
this, the godfather movie.

840
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:37,121
Michael had many options.

841
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:38,623
He destroyed his family.

842
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:39,790
And everything he touched.

843
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,292
In a way it's fair.

844
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,794
It's fair?

845
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:47,297
A good movie.

846
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,133
He didn't [ Mute ] it up.

847
00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:51,102
No.
