1
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:09,376
It's easily the most contentious
piece of real estate

2
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:09,910
in the world.

3
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:11,611
And there's no hope, none, of

4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:18,618
ever talking about it without
pissing somebody, if not

5
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,320
everybody off.

6
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:20,720
Maybe that's why it's taken me

7
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,821
so long to come here, a place

8
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,456
where even the names of ordinary

9
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:27,094
things are ferociously disputed.

10
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:29,262
Where does falafel come from?

11
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,264
Who makes the best hummus?

12
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,999
Is it a fence or a wall?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,767
By the end of this hour, I'll be

14
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,670
seen by many as a terrorist

15
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,607
sympathizer, a Zionist tool, a

16
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,809
self-hating Jew, an apologist

17
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,844
for American imperialism, an

18
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:50,083
orientalist, socialist,
fascist, CIA agent, and worse.

19
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:52,085
So here goes nothing.

20
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:57,057
♪

21
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,020
♪

22
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,521
I was raised without religion.

23
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,991
One side of the family long
ago, catholic... I think.

24
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,194
The other side, Jewish.

25
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:09,429
I've never been in a synagogue.

26
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,331
I don't believe in
a higher power.

27
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:12,032
But that doesn't make me any

28
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:15,034
less Jewish, I don't think.

29
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,838
These guys sandbagging me at the

30
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:23,210
wailing wall, they don't
seem to think so either.

31
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:23,944
Only half.

32
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:27,914
Jewish?

33
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:33,220
Yes.

34
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,221
You a righty?

35
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:42,222
I'm a righty, yes.

36
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:02,949
Mazel tov.

37
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,319
Mazel tov.

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,987
Thank you, gentlemen.

39
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:12,992
I've never felt so much like
I'm macerating as

40
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:13,993
something I'm not.

41
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:20,267
I am instinctively hostile
to any kind of devotion.

42
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,601
Certainty is any enemy.

43
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:26,273
I'm all about doubt, questioning

44
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,607
ones self and the
nature of reality.

45
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,108
When they grabbed hold of me and

46
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,779
in a totally nonjudgmental way

47
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,816
essentially... god's happy
to have you, here you go.

48
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:37,318
Oh, man.

49
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,954
My treachery is complete.

50
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,123
Just because I was raised
outside the faith with no

51
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,259
particular attachment or loyalty

52
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,360
to Israel doesn't mean that

53
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,029
plenty of people on this earth

54
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,499
don't hate me in principle.

55
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,301
I know that.

56
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:55,201
But the state of Israel, I never

57
00:03:55,202 --> 00:04:03,202
really knew what to think.

58
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,812
First look around, it's like

59
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:06,846
everybody says... it's pretty.

60
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,147
It's awesome.

61
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,650
It's urban.

62
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,651
Sophisticated.

63
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:11,885
Hip.

64
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:15,688
Like Southern California.

65
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,725
Only nicer.

66
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,860
Then you see the undraftees in

67
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:27,500
the streets and you
start to get the idea.

68
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,035
This is Jerusalem.

69
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:31,838
I'm taking you through
Damascus gate, which is one of

70
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,740
the gates to the old city.

71
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:37,377
These walls are pretty ancient.

72
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:40,179
People say they go
back to king David.

73
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,415
As history progressed,
they built up the wall.

74
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,385
So the top bed is the newest.

75
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,420
And by newest you mean...

76
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,722
Up to about the ottoman time.

77
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,192
The Turks left here
about 150 years ago.

78
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,363
And the Brits came and
they conquered us.

79
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58,097
I wasn't here.

80
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,867
Born here, now cooking in

81
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,035
London, he is the widely known

82
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,739
respected chef and co-author
of the book "Jerusalem."

83
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,109
Basically, this city was

84
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,611
divided into two until 1967 when

85
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,714
there was the
famous six-day war.

86
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,115
Yep.

87
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,550
And the hall that we're

88
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,552
traveling in now, walking
in is east Jerusalem.

89
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,087
It's the Palestinian part.

90
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:24,957
That was up until '67
belonged to Jordan.

91
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,727
So now it's under
Israeli control.

92
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,530
Very controversial because for

93
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:34,200
the Jews, for the Israelis,
the city has been unified.

94
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,402
But for the Palestinian, they

95
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:42,041
are under occupation, as
far as they are concerned.

96
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,043
We just have to go for a falafel

97
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,212
because it's so much part
of the culture here.

98
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,747
Again, contentious because Jews

99
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,449
or Israelis make falafel their

100
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,117
own and everybody in the world

101
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:57,457
thinks falafel is
an Israeli food.

102
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,892
It's been done for
generations here.

103
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,929
And here, you get falafel
that's just been fried.

104
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,497
You don't get it any other way.

105
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,965
When I come to a place like

106
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,100
that, I see there's a few left

107
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,902
from the previous customer,
I don't take that.

108
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,438
I want them to fry them for me.

109
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,606
That makes all the
difference in the world.

110
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:17,510
A whole different
animal, isn't it?

111
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,779
So is there a historically

112
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,448
provable answer to
who invented it?

113
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,515
Who made it first.

114
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:23,616
The one thing that's very clear

115
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,752
in this part of the world,

116
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,754
Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, it's

117
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:31,023
been cooked for many,
many, many generations.

118
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:31,825
On the other hand, you get Jews

119
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:35,327
from Yemen coming here...
They say hey, my great uncle

120
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,796
was in Syria at the time.

121
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,966
Hey, I remember distinctly
so there is actually no

122
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:40,801
answer to it.

123
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:47,339
But the question of food
appropriation or who owns the

124
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,708
food.

125
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,611
If you go you can go on
arguing about it forever.

126
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,313
The old city is divided
into four quarters.

127
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,148
There is Muslim quarter.

128
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,317
There is a Jewish quarter.

129
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,553
There is a Christian quarter.

130
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,056
And there's an Armenian quarter.

131
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,659
Each one functions
independently, but people that

132
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,030
live in the certain area are
all from that religion.

133
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:15,201
So here you see these Israeli
flags over this house.

134
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,736
So basically Jews have bought

135
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,171
this house, although it's
in the Muslim quarter.

136
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:19,973
That's very controversial

137
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:22,408
because it breaks the separation

138
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:26,846
that people would normally
expect in this city.

139
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:30,016
Now we're walking in the steps
of Jesus Christ, right?

140
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:33,152
As I so often do.

141
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,888
So this is villa de la Rosa,

142
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,824
which is the last trip Jesus did

143
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,325
before he was crucified.

144
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,027
People feel very emotional.

145
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:41,260
They come here and they feel

146
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,996
like oh, my god, I am walking in

147
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,566
the steps of Muhammad,
David, or Jesus.

148
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,067
It's like Jesus was here.

149
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,002
I feel like I should
be more something.

150
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,338
A little bit more pious?

151
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,373
A little bit.

152
00:07:54,374 --> 00:08:02,374
It's too late for me.

153
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:03,551
Great.

154
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:04,917
Get your own crown of thorns?

155
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,386
In answer to the question
what would Jesus wear?

156
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:11,992
Oh no, that's just wrong.

157
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,401
Israel is bordered by Egypt,

158
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,271
Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.

159
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:29,141
In 1967, after the six-day war,

160
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,143
Israel took control of the Gaza

161
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:35,882
strip, the Sinai peninsula, the

162
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,484
west bank, and east Jerusalem.

163
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,387
In 2003, Israel began
construction on a wall along the

164
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,757
green line representing the

165
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:45,758
Israeli-Palestinian border.

166
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,894
The wall now
stretches 450 miles.

167
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:52,431
When completed, it
will span 700 miles.

168
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:56,669
85% of it in
Palestinian territory.

169
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,070
On one hand, there's no doubt

170
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:02,341
that the number of suicide
bombings fell drastically.

171
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:08,347
On the other, there's this.

172
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:12,418
You cross from Jerusalem
into the west bank.

173
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:20,419
Also called Judea, Sumaria,
also called Palestine.

174
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,762
Since 1967, half a million

175
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:27,667
settlers have moved here, all in

176
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,870
contravention of
international law.

177
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:35,474
Many in contravention
of international law.

178
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,409
Though it seems to make
little difference.

179
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:42,048
They're here and in
ever-larger numbers.

180
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,351
This is one of our drivers from

181
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,319
Tel Aviv who I asked about

182
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,921
graffiti on this house
near the settlements.

183
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,356
So what is price tagging?

184
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:53,960
Something happens in a
settlement or some attack with

185
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,527
Jews, kids from the settlement

186
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,064
would come and have a price
tag for every activity.

187
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,899
So they come to a village like

188
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,068
this, they will destroy cars,

189
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,436
they will write on
walls like this.

190
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,673
It says against Arabs, the state

191
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:09,241
of Israel is alive, and
death to the Arabs.

192
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,877
Intimidating.

193
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:17,083
I mean, you put two targets
on my house, I'm moving.

194
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,918
This is Ellie, a settlement with

195
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,353
a population of over 3,000,

196
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:25,892
relatively isolated from
the rest of Israel.

197
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,094
This is the chief executive of

198
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,197
the settlement and its
former head of security.

199
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:36,669
Here you see from up
above most of our town.

200
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,071
You see the Palestinian
villages all around.

201
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,539
It's an unusual situation.

202
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,874
A lot of your neighbors would

203
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,976
very much like you
to not be here.

204
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,044
I know most of them.

205
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:50,582
And most of them, they are
happy that we're here.

206
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,884
Because we... actually we gave

207
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,855
them prosperity for
the first 45 years.

208
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,057
Wherever the PLO
came, they lost it.

209
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:04,363
I'm guessing a lot of people
would disagree with that

210
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,632
statement.

211
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,234
Radars and cameras.

212
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,470
So from the high ground, you

213
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,072
can see anybody
walking at night.

214
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,274
You could see from
pretty far out.

215
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:15,976
Definitely.

216
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:18,978
Could you identify
them after the fact?

217
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:19,813
Depends.

218
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:23,983
What we have are protocols
that we work with.

219
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:31,984
And we had our successes.

220
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:38,497
We drive to another
settlement a few miles away.

221
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:42,902
Hot, sun-bleached,
suburban feeling.

222
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:46,238
Behind its ring of electronic
surveillance censors and

223
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,842
security, everything
they feel they need.

224
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:57,843
A school, public transportation,
and a petting zoo.

225
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:09,929
He has lived here for ten years.

226
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:17,930
He's a wine maker
and amateur cook.

227
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:29,281
You're not kidding around.

228
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:33,719
The salmon is marinated with

229
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,221
pomegranate juice that... on the

230
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,223
season, I squeeze pomegranates.

231
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,726
I freeze the juice so I'll
have it all year round.

232
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,061
Where were you before here?

233
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,162
I was born in Pennsylvania.

234
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,365
So your parents brought
you over at age 4?

235
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,167
Yeah.

236
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:52,138
Kids living in the relative
comfort and familiarity of

237
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:52,572
Pennsylvania.

238
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:53,906
Heading off to what must have,

239
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,875
at least in part of their mind,

240
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,810
would seem an uncertain.

241
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:58,378
Yes.

242
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,578
It was very difficult for them.

243
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:04,216
Almost all Jews say next year,

244
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:08,587
it's part of prayers that
we say all the time.

245
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,689
The Bible, it's all right there.

246
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,360
It all happened here.

247
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,662
That's sort of a
nonnegotiable position.

248
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,097
You see prophesies coming true.

249
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,531
Things coming to life.

250
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,599
Mountains that nobody wanted to

251
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,368
live on, nobody dared to... for

252
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,570
thousands of years,
nobody wanted this place.

253
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,573
And then finally, we come here

254
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,209
and everything is
flourishing again.

255
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,611
It makes you feel
good, you know?

256
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:37,749
You've been here since '90.

257
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,887
You look over the edge
there, an Arab village.

258
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:41,454
Yeah.

259
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,722
There is one that you
can see from here.

260
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,957
At any point during that

261
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,625
time, you ever go to anybody's

262
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:47,726
house, sit down and eat?

263
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,963
Not there, but in
other villages.

264
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,699
Ever sat down at a Muslim table?

265
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,104
Muslim table... you host
and everybody else...

266
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:58,638
Coffee.

267
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,906
But not there.

268
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:06,913
No, because as a religious
Jew, I eat only kosher.

269
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:09,315
So they respect that.

270
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,951
So they don't offer me.

271
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,620
So I've got to ask you about

272
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,222
something that troubled me.

273
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,490
Coming up, the first house

274
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,593
before you come up the drive to

275
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:26,598
this village, the graffiti
on the front... yes.

276
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,168
The targets spray painted on.

277
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,003
Yes.

278
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:32,804
Whodunit?

279
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,340
Villains.

280
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,507
Bad people.

281
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,643
Kids?

282
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:41,280
I don't know.

283
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,015
Apparently kids.

284
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:45,651
When we educate kids, kids
are not able to understand

285
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:46,519
complicated things.

286
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,354
They see the world
in black and white.

287
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,823
When you get older, you're
able to see the gray.

288
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,625
And when someone hits you...

289
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,762
I understand why
kids would do it.

290
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,465
Given what you told me earlier,

291
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:03,002
identifying the perpetrators

292
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:11,003
within the realm of possibility?

293
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,386
They're young people.

294
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,454
Why not paint it over?

295
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,390
Good question.

296
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,291
Maybe we should.

297
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:24,824
You're right.

298
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:27,059
Elsewhere in the west bank,

299
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:35,060
just outside of Ramallah
meet Betty and Mona.

300
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,577
Two members of a group of women

301
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,647
who call themselves
the speed sisters.

302
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:56,648
The first all-female
Palestinian racing team.

303
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:01,593
Hi.

304
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,362
I'm Tony.

305
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:10,069
Good to meet you.

306
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,039
When I'm riding a car, I'm
the happiest girl ever.

307
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,440
Racing, it's in my blood.

308
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,442
Here in Palestine,
it's very small.

309
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:17,377
There's no roads.

310
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:22,581
So when I drive, I speed.

311
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,051
I feel free.

312
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:27,786
Do you find that people
underestimated you at first?

313
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,689
At the beginning, they could
maybe make fun of us.

314
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:36,695
But when we got good
scores... yeah.

315
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,797
A car doesn't know if
you're a woman or a man.

316
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:43,535
A lot of girls want to
join us as speed sisters.

317
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,971
But some of their families
are very reserved.

318
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,374
Their don't like their daughters

319
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,209
to be between men racing.

320
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,943
Palestine is a very
reserved society.

321
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,745
So are things getting better?

322
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,381
Staying the same, or worse?

323
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,984
You never know what's going
to happen in Palestine.

324
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,087
One day it's good and the other

325
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,754
day it's just... you never know.

326
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,923
It's a crazy country.

327
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,892
The local police would prefer

328
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,662
them off the streets
for obvious reasons.

329
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,599
But the track here, such as
it is, has its drawbacks.

330
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,004
It's basically a parking lot
across from the detention

331
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:19,339
center.

332
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,006
What do they think
about this next door?

333
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,242
Do they ever give you problems?

334
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,677
This is an Israeli jail.

335
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,246
One time we were here with speed

336
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,947
sisters and there was problems

337
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,317
because of the prisoners.

338
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:34,320
So I just stopped my car over
there and I was walking.

339
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,256
I wanted to see what's going on.

340
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,857
And the Israeli soldiers, they

341
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,760
came running at me and
they start shooting at me.

342
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:47,599
And I got shot in the back.

343
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
It was tear gas.

344
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:53,205
So my speed sisters, they
took me to the hospital.

345
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,141
I fainted.

346
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:56,942
Have you thought of challenging
the Israelis to put

347
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:57,777
up a team?

348
00:17:57,778 --> 00:17:59,878
I can't race because
my car is Palestinian.

349
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,547
What if they come over here?

350
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,048
They're not allowed to enter

351
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,816
the west bank and we're not

352
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,051
allowed to go to Jerusalem, so

353
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,052
how can we race together?

354
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:11,023
OK, silly question.

355
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,308
It's right there for all to see.

356
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,876
And it feels like something out

357
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:35,547
of a science fiction film.

358
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,882
This is the wall.

359
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,850
From the other side, from inside

360
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,520
this place, for instance, the

361
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,355
refugee camp in the district of

362
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,590
Bethlehem, it doesn't feel like

363
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:52,591
anything other than
what it is, a prison.

364
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:58,704
Abed is the founder of the
children's theatre center.

365
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:03,375
So we are at the north
entrance of Bethlehem, heading

366
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,376
to the refugee camp.

367
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,246
So this has been
here since 1950.

368
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,447
Yes.

369
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,949
It started with tents.

370
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,755
People were under the tents
for about seven years.

371
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:24,756
And later, they started
building shelters.

372
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:31,737
First impressions of the
camp, there's a remarkable

373
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:32,572
number of kids.

374
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:36,041
Now it's about 6,000 people.

375
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,377
And 2/3 are under 18 years old.

376
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:43,249
So it's a very young population.

377
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,983
Unfortunately, with the
continuing degradation of the

378
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,752
political and economic
situation, we are in the

379
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:51,056
situation where we have
no playgrounds anymore.

380
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,591
Children play in the streets

381
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,926
beneath walls covered in images

382
00:19:54,927 --> 00:20:01,433
of martyrs, plane hijackers,
political prisoners.

383
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,769
6,000 people, of that number,

384
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,505
66% are under the age of 18.

385
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,939
I don't care where that is in

386
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,410
the world, that's pretty much a

387
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:15,614
recipe for unruly behavior,
I think would be the best.

388
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:16,848
Well, yes.

389
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,584
Especially when you don't have

390
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,151
any possibilities to evacuate

391
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,488
the anger and the stress
in a creative way.

392
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,424
So after I finished my studies,

393
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,025
I came back here and I started

394
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,960
using theatre as one of the most

395
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,829
amazing, powerful, civilized and

396
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,731
nonviolent means to
express yourself.

397
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,132
To tell your story.

398
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:34,967
To be truthful.

399
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:38,770
And this is for me the remedy
to build peace within.

400
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,272
And hopefully help them to think

401
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,973
that they can grow up and change

402
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:46,812
the world and create miracles.

403
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:50,148
Without explode themselves.

404
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:54,152
But to stay alive.

405
00:20:54,153 --> 00:21:02,060
Abed takes me to the
martyrs quarter to be fed.

406
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,496
She offers Palestinian cooking

407
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,664
classes, helping her provide for

408
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:12,003
six children, one of
whom is disabled.

409
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,204
In America, kids grow up with

410
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:17,042
pop stars, sports players.

411
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:20,011
It's unthinkable for a child to

412
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,847
look up to a politician or to

413
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:25,584
look up to a military figure.

414
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,419
Sports or entertainment.

415
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,355
Here, kids 4 or 5 years old

416
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:32,190
every day, they're looking at

417
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:35,727
somebody who, you know,
brought down a plane.

418
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:36,762
Yeah.

419
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,830
I'm not questioning why that is.

420
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,366
I know.

421
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:42,100
Do you think it's helpful?

422
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:47,373
Well, I guess we have a history.

423
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:52,478
We are people who are
under occupation.

424
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,679
They are heroes.

425
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,183
And their heroes are those
who resist the occupation.

426
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:03,221
And to tell you the truth,

427
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:05,256
sometimes I have been with some

428
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,526
political parties, when they put

429
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:12,731
images of people who are
killed in their houses.

430
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:18,370
Ahmed's sister, the 29th of

431
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,005
October, 2001, she was killed in

432
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,073
her kitchen by a sniper.

433
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,610
But when these political parties

434
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:26,412
take this woman and want to make

435
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:28,914
a montage of photos with her

436
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,750
carrying a gun to say this is

437
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,786
the hero, sorry, this
is not the truth.

438
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:40,091
This woman was
killed in her house.

439
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,594
We will go today and ask the

440
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,963
Palestinians who
is the great evil?

441
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:48,600
You ask these kids, who
will they recognize?

442
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:53,939
They recognize a man from Gaza,

443
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,409
Mohamed Assa, a
singer who sings.

444
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:04,850
He becomes more famous than
Arafat and everybody else.

445
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:12,851
This is another image
of these times.

446
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:17,696
You can almost believe for a

447
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:21,633
minute or two that some
kind of peace, some kind of

448
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,134
reconciliation, meeting of the

449
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:27,773
minds, sanity is possible
after you visit Majda.

450
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:28,974
It's a restaurant in what looks

451
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:36,548
like an idyllic village
in the Judean hills.

452
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:43,622
It feels like an alternate
universe for a number of

453
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:47,993
reasons.

454
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,461
Someone Jewish.

455
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,563
One is Muslim, from
a nearby village.

456
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,700
They're partners, co-owners of

457
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,134
Majda, and also married.

458
00:23:56,135 --> 00:24:00,739
They're unsurprisingly
friends of Yotan.

459
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,840
Together they grow and raise

460
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,742
much of what's used
in their kitchen.

461
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,310
Their food reflects both their

462
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:12,017
different backgrounds and
their commonalities.

463
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:14,252
We're going to spoil you now.

464
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:21,827
Yeah, here you go.

465
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,529
So you grew up in this town.

466
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,531
Yes, in this village.

467
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,198
Where did you grow up?

468
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,200
Near the beach.

469
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,435
Near the beach.

470
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,370
Not the neighborhood.

471
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:35,607
But we met in the neighborhood.

472
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:38,076
We work together in hotel.

473
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:42,180
How did that go down
with the families?

474
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:42,582
Now wonderful.

475
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,049
In the beginning, not so much.

476
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:50,388
Started with a lot of questions.

477
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:51,023
Understand that we love each

478
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:52,724
other and they can do nothing,

479
00:24:52,725 --> 00:25:00,725
so we continue and
they support us.

480
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:04,570
This is your special farm eggs.

481
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:05,637
Farm eggs.

482
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:09,708
Peppers from your garden?

483
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:10,209
Tomato.

484
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,245
That looks awesome beyond words.

485
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:18,116
It is incredibly beautiful here.

486
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,619
I don't know why I
didn't expect that.

487
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,388
A lot of people come and say

488
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:31,389
it's like Provence,
it's like Italy.

489
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,499
You like it?

490
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,234
I do.

491
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:39,437
Roasted tomatoes, okra.

492
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:40,438
Onion and mint.

493
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,273
That's all they do.

494
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:44,109
What they do a lot here is
char the hell out of it.

495
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,944
So it's really smoky just from

496
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:52,751
being in the pan
on very high heat.

497
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:58,423
So generally speaking,
who lives in this area?

498
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:03,929
Mostly Arab... ethnically
Arab in this part of town?

499
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:11,930
I'm the only Jewish in...
Hardly any Jewish in the

500
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,105
village.

501
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:15,106
Zucchini that's been grilled.

502
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:18,610
Then we use fried yogurt,
so that's the sauce.

503
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:20,846
That's the go-to flavor.

504
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:25,717
Very typical for
Palestinian cooking.

505
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:26,485
It's good.

506
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:30,121
I just had this incredibly
delicious meal completely

507
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:33,324
oblivious to the fact that
it's entirely vegetarian.

508
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,560
If any of the vegetarian

509
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,195
restaurants in New York served

510
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:45,196
food that tasted like this,
I would actually go there.

511
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:52,310
I'd consider it.

512
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:55,747
Fried zucchini with mint.

513
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:59,885
And little sweet apricots.

514
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:00,687
It's delicious.

515
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:01,688
Are you hopeful?

516
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:02,488
Of course.

517
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,355
I have my children.

518
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:08,694
I need to say that.

519
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:12,831
Together we can build
something for our kids.

520
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:13,766
Our future.

521
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,333
That's what we think and that's

522
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,870
what we give the message
for our customers.

523
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,339
The fact that it actually

524
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,774
manages to do whatnot so many

525
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:25,010
chefs try to do here, and that

526
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:29,080
is sort of mix the Jewish
ethnicity or background with

527
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:33,419
Arab food.

528
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:43,228
Getting out of Gaza from

529
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,430
Israel is truly one of the most

530
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,365
surreal travel experiences
you have on earth.

531
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,368
Over 1.5 million
people live in Gaza.

532
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,637
Most of them
considered refugees.

533
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,105
Meaning they're not from the

534
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,241
place they're compelled
to live now.

535
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:58,576
In most cases, they're either

536
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:02,347
prohibited from or
unable to leave.

537
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,483
Israel decides who
comes and goes.

538
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:09,320
What gets in and what stays out.

539
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,090
Apart from journalists, aid

540
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:14,459
workers, emergency responders,

541
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,829
very few people are allowed
to cross into Gaza.

542
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,298
In 2005, the Israeli defense

543
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,000
forces left the Gaza strip and

544
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:28,439
all Israeli settlers
were removed.

545
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,777
Now inside Gaza,
Hamas is in charge.

546
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:34,145
Considered a terrorist
organization by both the united

547
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:42,146
states and Israel, they
got elected in 2006.

548
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:56,001
This is Laila Hadan, a native

549
00:28:56,002 --> 00:29:04,002
Gazan, journalist and author
of "the Gaza kitchen."

550
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:07,212
They're not as big as they

551
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:08,814
used to be, that's primarily

552
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:13,018
because the fishermen can't go

553
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,519
beyond three to six
nautical miles.

554
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,687
If you go beyond, what happens?

555
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,224
They'll shoot at the fishermen,
destroy their boats,

556
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,893
cut their fishing nets,
they'll detain them.

557
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,195
It's obviously really
risky business.

558
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,230
Nine nautical miles, that's

559
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:26,497
where that deep sea channel is

560
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:31,536
where you're going to get
the really good catches.

561
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:32,138
Gaza is the last Palestinian

562
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:33,404
area with access to the coast.

563
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,640
That's really important
to remember.

564
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,808
You have the west bank just an

565
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,744
hour away, but many of the

566
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:40,379
Palestinians, they have never

567
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:48,253
seen the sea, have
never been to the sea.

568
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:52,023
The family owns a small farm

569
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,524
in the eastern Gaza strip.

570
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,426
She and her husband are unusual

571
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,595
in that they cook together.

572
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,430
This is not typical in this part

573
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:02,767
of the world or in this culture.

574
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:06,704
They use their own fresh-killed

575
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,874
chickens to make
the Gazan classic.

576
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,441
The traditional Palestinian dish

577
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,010
comprised of layers of fried

578
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:15,947
eggplant, tomato, potatoes,
Caramelized onions, and

579
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:22,520
chicken sauteed, them simmered
in a broth with nutmeg,

580
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,789
cinnamon, cardimum, and rice.

581
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,092
It's a big family.

582
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:28,393
Children, grandchildren all

583
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:35,266
living under the same roof,
and it can get chaotic.

584
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,136
So let's talk about
food and eat food.

585
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,470
Yeah, yeah, sure.

586
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,739
What do we have here?

587
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,711
This is called mahmouba.

588
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:52,450
Traditionally lamb,
in this case chicken.

589
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:57,122
They're very concerned that
we're being very rude.

590
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:05,123
We're not allowing
the others to eat.

591
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,267
Wow.

592
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:16,674
For me, being from Gaza,
being a child of Diaspora, I

593
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,344
always thought food was an
interesting way to tell the

594
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:19,912
Palestinian story.

595
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:22,280
Being able to discover this lost

596
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,514
history, this Palestinian past.

597
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,817
Plus, the food is
really dang good.

598
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:27,852
That it is.

599
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,521
I think it was also important
to be able to provide

600
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:31,689
Palestinians an image of

601
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,591
themselves that they recognize,

602
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:34,759
a very humane image, because all

603
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,194
they're seeing in the media,

604
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,196
whether here or there, whether

605
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,498
on Arabic channels or abroad,

606
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,367
you know, is this kind of very

607
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:46,771
caricatured images of gunned men

608
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:50,508
and this kind of grim
cinder block landscape.

609
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,778
You're not entering
into the private homes.

610
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,113
What does a kitchen look like,

611
00:31:55,114 --> 00:32:00,418
or what does a
family you see here.

612
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,320
Do you like it, she's asking?

613
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:06,724
Absolutely delicious.

614
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,893
Really, really good.

615
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:09,528
Yeah?

616
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:12,230
She wants you to open
a restaurant for her.

617
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:15,133
Keep cooking like this.

618
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,567
It's really delicious.

619
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:20,571
Gaza has three distinctive
culinary heritage.

620
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,307
Those who hail from villages

621
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:25,743
that were either depopulated
or destroyed in 1948.

622
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,146
And they constitute about 75% of

623
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,247
the population of Gaza.

624
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,915
And they kind of bring with them

625
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,851
their own distinct cuisine.

626
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,486
That's very different from the

627
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,222
cuisine of the city, Gaza city,

628
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:39,057
which tends to use much more

629
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,692
heat, much more chili peppers,

630
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,161
from the cuisine of the coast,

631
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:47,732
which is rich with seafood,
of course, and a very

632
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:52,170
sophisticated, very
urbane cuisine.

633
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,271
I guess the first question

634
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:57,942
would be, in your lifetime, will

635
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:03,181
you be able to visit Yahba?

636
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:04,615
She says she hopes she can.

637
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:07,918
She also hopes she can
go to Jerusalem as well.

638
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:15,919
So she's optimistic.

639
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,363
She's saying... first she said

640
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:20,765
you're not allowing us to.

641
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,233
Then corrected and said the

642
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:23,434
Israelis aren't allowing us.

643
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:31,435
Go, go.

644
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:37,982
This is a normal tone of voice.

645
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,384
Not upset, by the way.

646
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:40,252
This is how we talk.

647
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:40,786
We yell.

648
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:41,986
What's he saying?

649
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,254
Give me a permit.

650
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:48,127
If they allow, of
course I'll go.

651
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,480
Laila's got something
to show me.

652
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:15,620
A watermelon salad she
discovered on her recent trip

653
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:16,522
here that's really
piqued her interest.

654
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:16,922
So off we go.

655
00:34:16,923 --> 00:34:23,461
This will take a minute.

656
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,296
We arrive at what looks like a

657
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:29,200
pretty serious gathering.

658
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:32,603
This is a Duwan, and we're soon

659
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,105
joined by her husband Abu.

660
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:36,307
It's an area where the elders

661
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:38,809
gather to, you know, resolve

662
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,547
community problems,
to kind of advise.

663
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:46,984
All these guys are originally

664
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,853
from an area now part of Israel,

665
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,221
so they're bound together by

666
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,656
traditions and a way of life

667
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:52,657
very different from here, where

668
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:56,060
they've been relocated
and lived since 1948.

669
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:57,362
Does he think he'll be able to

670
00:34:57,363 --> 00:35:00,165
go to his ancestral homeland in

671
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:05,870
his lifetime, his
children's lifetime?

672
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:13,644
What's his guess?

673
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,347
This enemy.

674
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:19,417
And we understand that.

675
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:23,521
We hope.

676
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:28,092
Me, my son.

677
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:32,563
My daughter.

678
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,200
So what they're making now...

679
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:39,036
It's basically baby watermelon,
underripe watermelon.

680
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,705
This is sort of a specialty of

681
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:44,575
Southern Gaza, but also Sinai.

682
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,878
It's usually something that's

683
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,381
made specifically by
men, I was told here.

684
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:51,682
You can see they're fire

685
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,218
roasting the baby watermelons.

686
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:55,253
They cover them
with aluminum foil.

687
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:56,454
They put them through a wire,

688
00:35:56,455 --> 00:36:01,726
kind of like a rustic skewer.

689
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,428
And then they just
throw them in there.

690
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:05,396
And the idea is that they take

691
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:11,736
the pulp out, so that's
what's going on.

692
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,271
And then what they do while

693
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:17,041
that's fire roasting is they

694
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:20,211
knead an unlevined dough over

695
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,280
there with whole-wheat, barley,

696
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:26,751
plenty of rich, extra
virgin olive oil.

697
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,985
And then they throw that into

698
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,620
the pit as well, or they dig a

699
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:31,989
pit in the sand over there.

700
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,090
Right in the coals?

701
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,091
Yep.

702
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:40,431
And they mix that all together.

703
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:41,267
So it's interesting.

704
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:43,100
Because right now, we're about,

705
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:46,170
what, 35 minutes
away from Gaza city.

706
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:49,006
Ask anyone in Gaza city if

707
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:53,511
they've heard of
this dish and, no.

708
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:55,513
So even in an area as small as

709
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:57,615
Gaza, you see this
very wide variation.

710
00:36:57,616 --> 00:37:05,257
They're going to clean it up.

711
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,541
Many, if not most of these

712
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,710
guys, are not too sympathetic to

713
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:28,979
my country or my
ethnicity, I'm guessing.

714
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,683
But there's that
hospitality thing.

715
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:36,721
Anywhere you go in the
Muslim world, it seems.

716
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,889
You feed your guests and do your

717
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,858
best to make them feel at home.

718
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:44,995
We have to eat.

719
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:52,996
You're supposed to eat
this with your hands.

720
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,172
Mm, very good.

721
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,808
He's saying if you eat this,

722
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:01,512
you shouldn't have another
meal for three days.

723
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,314
Where does this dish come from?

724
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:07,184
This is a dish that's native

725
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:10,020
to Southern Gaza, the Sinai,

726
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,923
sort of the desert
Bedouin areas.

727
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,692
All the food I've had so far

728
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:17,094
in Gaza has been very different

729
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,764
than in anything else I've
had in the Arab world.

730
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,333
Different flavor spectrum.

731
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,034
Totally.

732
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:30,708
It's kind of it's own little
gastronomical bubble.

733
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,543
I find that the food has more

734
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:40,544
flavor, I get a
better cepsry experience.

735
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,119
They have children, and they

736
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,254
like to eat with their hands.

737
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,693
He's saying god gave us hands
to eat with, not spoons.

738
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:13,250
One can be forgiven for
thinking, when you see how

739
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,819
similar they are, the two

740
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,587
peoples, both of them cook with

741
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:18,155
pride, eat with passion, love

742
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,324
their kids, love the land in

743
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,593
which they live or the land they

744
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,563
dream of returning to, who live

745
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:27,598
so close, who are locked in such

746
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,401
an intimate, if deadly embrace

747
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:31,936
might somehow, some day, figure

748
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,905
out how to live with each other.

749
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:38,443
But that would be very
mushy thinking indeed.

750
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:40,144
Those things in the end probably

751
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:48,145
don't count for much at all.

752
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:55,192
Gatan Galkowitz runs a

753
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:57,294
restaurant just seven miles
from the Gaza strip.

754
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:58,963
You and your family have paid

755
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:00,965
the most unbelievable price.

756
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:04,869
My daughter was killed
by mortar sent by Hamas.

757
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,672
In some Israeli towns and

758
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,140
villages within close proximity

759
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,842
of the Gaza strip, bus stops

760
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,210
double as bomb shelters and air

761
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,812
raid sirens warn of incoming

762
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:18,315
missiles fired from
less than a mile away.

763
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,985
Rockets and mortar shells have

764
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:22,987
been known to fall from the sky

765
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:26,356
in these parts and no one
understands the consequences

766
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,525
more than this man.

767
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:30,661
You were not a fervent Zionist.

768
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,329
No.

769
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,831
You were not an orthodox Jew.

770
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:34,666
No.

771
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:37,702
And yet here you are, at the

772
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,470
spear point, right at the dip.

773
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:40,238
Here's your restaurant.

774
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:41,006
There is a shelter.

775
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:41,573
Here you are.

776
00:40:41,574 --> 00:40:46,877
After the death of my daughter,
I just start to talk,

777
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:47,878
to whom?

778
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,516
To people who want to listen.

779
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:55,520
I know that my daughter was

780
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:58,355
killed for no reason and I know

781
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,257
that people on the other side

782
00:40:59,258 --> 00:41:05,930
have been killed for no reason.

783
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,097
Childrens, old people.

784
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,599
I have been a soldier in Gaza.

785
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,001
I saw very poor people.

786
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:14,539
I know there is interest in
keeping this poor people.

787
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:19,209
You can go far, far, but the

788
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:25,349
bottom line is, let's
stop with the suffering.

789
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,852
You know, I went to
this settler community.

790
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:28,453
Nice people.

791
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:31,856
And I said to you, you
know, they were nice.

792
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:34,625
And you said, you said, you
said, they're all nice.

793
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:35,893
They're all nice.

794
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:39,263
I know, nice, very nice
Palestinian people.

795
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:43,067
They're all nice, but if you

796
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:45,469
scratch, if you push, they all

797
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:52,777
want... they'll all say,
throw them in the sea.

798
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:55,412
Most of the people,
they don't talk.

799
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:56,814
They are very upset.

800
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,148
They are fed up.

801
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:03,721
And the same goes from
the other side to us.

802
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,455
You have to find the right

803
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,225
people on both village, also on

804
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,762
the down, also on the up,
and maybe they talk.

805
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:19,763
And I am sure that is possible.

806
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:25,109
The opportunities to do that
here are very, very, very

807
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,644
limited, it seemed.

808
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:27,912
I agree.

809
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:32,316
And I mean, one doesn't even

810
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:34,952
have to speak metaphorically,

811
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:36,954
because there is an actual wall.

812
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:39,790
Or a fence, depending on
who you're talking to.

813
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:40,958
Fence or wall.

814
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,459
No, it's a big wall.

815
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,428
It's ugly.

816
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:44,695
It's really ugly.

817
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:49,635
You can see it, it's not
far away from here.
