00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:51,431
cameras.

368
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:55,834
Soon there's a mob of very
angry people coming our way.

369
00:18:55,835 --> 00:19:00,439
We do not turn around our
cameras for obvious reasons.

370
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,345
These days things are
slowly, slowly improving.

371
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,914
But before, we wouldn't
walk this freely.

372
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,216
Now we are free.

373
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,884
There's actual law enforcement
going on in fits and

374
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:13,119
starts.

375
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,222
And that's making a difference.

376
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:19,958
Black owned legitimate
businesses have gained a real

377
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,727
foothold.

378
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,794
There are new revitalization

379
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,031
projects like farmer's
markets springing up.

380
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,466
Buildings are being reclaimed.

381
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:32,571
And people here hope that
Hillbrow is past the bad old

382
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:32,772
days.

383
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,273
There's no fear now.

384
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,807
You have to relax.

385
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,211
Nothing will happen to you.

386
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,935
>What's in a name?

387
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,271
If the name is Soweto, you best

388
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:45,711
believe it means plenty.

389
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:46,945
This is Madu.

390
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,714
For over a decade he's been in

391
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,316
what has at times been the very

392
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,851
difficult business
of driving a taxi.

393
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:53,786
You should probably know that

394
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:56,221
the word taxi in Soweto means

395
00:20:56,222 --> 00:21:02,661
something a little different
than, say, New York.

396
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:07,399
How many taxis do
you have in Soweto?

397
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,636
This coming from a particular
passenger means Soweto.

398
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,237
Also this and this.

399
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:15,341
Johannesburg has an elaborate
system of hand signals

400
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,676
indicating desired
routes of travel.

401
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,346
You're looking at the hand

402
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:21,347
signals and say I'm not going

403
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,248
there, I'm not going there.

404
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,282
I'm looking at hand sayingals.

405
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:31,990
In 1994 Soweto came into
being as workers lodging.

406
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,992
A place to put black laborers

407
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,527
comfortably removed
from white society.

408
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,095
A ghetto.

409
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,863
By the 1950s it had become the

410
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,599
center of resistance
to white rule.

411
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,767
Synonymous with the struggle

412
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:48,207
against the whole
rotten racist system.

413
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:34,586
Now there is a definite carhe

414
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,287
to having lived in Soweto.

415
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,789
A very real pride back at being

416
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,990
in the center of things when it

417
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,592
was hard and dangerous
to have an opinion.

418
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,228
Nelson Mandela lived here.

419
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,496
Desmond tutu.

420
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,764
When you're of certain age and

421
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,599
you say you were born and bred

422
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,401
in Soweto, it means something.

423
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,603
Do mostly people own
their homes or rent?

424
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,739
Mostly people own their homes.

425
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,240
Things start to get
a little better.

426
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,341
Can you build up?

427
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,342
You can build up.

428
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,444
Look at the streets here and

429
00:22:58,445 --> 00:22:59,845
you see what that
kind of pride does.

430
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,748
It may not be a rich area,
but it's immaculate.

Squared away.

fleeing to elsewhere.

00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:26,938
That there are these layers of

549
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,407
things that you couldn't have.

550
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,242
Like restaurants.

551
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:31,642
I go to restaurants.

552
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,611
I think to myself, wow, this

553
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:34,913
many years ago, I couldn't have

554
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,281
come here with this person.

555
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:39,017
They were not allowed
to sit in here.

556
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,819
And I remember very
clearly being around 8.

557
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,789
The cafe owner would regularly

558
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,793
not pay the customer who
was black with change.

559
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,761
He would pay him
with bubble gum.

560
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:54,032
And the guy somehow,
he couldn't argue.

561
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:57,468
If you were a black guy, you got

562
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,171
your change in bubble gum.

563
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:02,774
I was 8 years old feeling like,

564
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:04,442
oh, my god, it was so terrible.

565
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,844
But you couldn't say anything.

566
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:10,949
Because that would
have been worse.

567
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,451
It represented such badness.

568
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:16,755
It just seems mad.

I think that was very good.

575
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,953
It's a little sad.

576
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,188
You know what?

577
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,722
That is such good meat.

That's really what we do.

Though this one weighs in
around a ton, rest assured,

every bite, every
scrap, will be eaten.

Yeah.

A UNESCO world heritage site.

An incredible look back at where

we, the human animal, came from.

598
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,030
It's a classic little sink hole.

00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:39,966

Now a world heritage site.

604
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,205

out of the valley.

the answer to that.

728
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:26,872
But their intentions is clear.

729
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:41,586
>No more hipster jokes.

730
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:46,357
It's low hanging fruit.

731
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:50,227
And one can no longer argue
against the steady creek of

732
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,863
their foodie sensibilities.

733
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:56,634
Cheeses, yes, right over there.

734
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,536
Hand made, yes.

735
00:38:58,537 --> 00:38:59,037
There.

736
00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:05,376
Thin crust pizza, a very
respectable piayya, yes, yes,

737
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:05,811
and yes.

738
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:06,778
It's official.

739
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:09,580
They're here and they
aren't going anywhere.

740
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,717
I like the idea of a burger for

741
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:15,453
breakfast or is there something
perverse about that.

742
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,988
Throw in a crowd of much more

743
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,757
diverse and hungry people, and

744
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,726
you might think
you're in Brooklyn.

745
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:25,630
Surely, this is not a bad thing.

746
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:30,000
This is neighbor goods
market in Johannesburg.

747
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:33,270
My dining companion features

748
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:40,144
writer Percy Mumbando says
we should hold out for this.

749
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:44,248
One with lots of cheese.

750
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:50,254
Flattened ground beef
sered over flames.

751
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,790
Cook the food right.

752
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,792
Add mozzarella cheese, fold

753
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:59,096
it up, pick your condiments.

754
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:03,367
Ka badge, tomato, onion,
lettuce, hot peppers.

755
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:09,440
Up to the roof with
a view and eat.

756
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:10,141
Spicy.

757
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:10,509
Good.

758
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,610
I guess I want to talk
about Nelson Mandela.

759
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,945
Because what I was not aware of

760
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,949
at all was the degree to which

761
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,551
he was personally responsible

762
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:23,353
for really the nuts and bolts of

763
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:30,461
the transition from white
rule to majority rule.

764
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:31,662
Now he's very ill.

765
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:31,997
Reporter:

766
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:33,030
Yeah, yeah.

767
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,364
What happens after Mandela?

768
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:38,235
We go on.

769
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:42,139
And I think through god
we have him as a symbol.

770
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,375
I think Mandela
represents our nation.

771
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,177
The test we use to
check the way forth.

772
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,813
All the things that could

773
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,248
have gone terribly wrong, it's a

774
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:54,585
remarkable thing
how well it went.

775
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:58,489
Between 1990 and 1994, tough

776
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,827
times, you know, into
the city fighting.

777
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:05,496
Black-on-black violence.

778
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:06,431
Black-on-white violence.

779
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:10,568
But we transcended that coming

780
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:14,271
together regardless of
the unresolved issues.

781
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:17,341
What extent are
things getting mixed?

782
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:19,343
We like to think we live in a

783
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:21,378
rainbow nation, but in fact, in

784
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:25,783
the states like to a great
extent in different

785
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:26,117
neighborhoods.

786
00:41:26,118 --> 00:41:29,787
In some ways it looks to me

787
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,455
outside looking in a little more

788
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:35,025
gracefully mixed up than
we've managed in the states.

789
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:38,462
Here you've got black, white,

790
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:41,398
colored, all sorts
of people here.

791
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,233
Also once you have the knowledge

792
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,903
that the economic disparities

793
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:49,707
are managing to keep
us divided as well.

794
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:52,209
I think what we need to do is

795
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:56,547
unpack what we mean by rainbow.

796
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:58,716
I think being diverse also means

797
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:00,551
that there'll be
moments of discord.

798
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:04,154
And you think things will
continue to improve?

799
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,056
Yeah.

800
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:06,090
I think we've seen our worst.

801
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:07,491
And that's not to say that we're

802
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:10,260
getting it right all the time.

803
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,897
But it's an experiment you need

804
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:14,899
to find as you go along.

805
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,567
That's really the
south African story.

806
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,803
The dream is there.

807
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,238
We all agree that the
visions are there.

808
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:24,341
But these are not
bigger than our hopes.

809
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:27,477
What did I know about south
Africa before I game here?

810
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,246
Exactly nothing,
as it turns out.

811
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,682
But I think based on what I've

812
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,818
seen, that if the world
can get it right here.

813
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:36,520
A country with a past like south

814
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:38,188
Africa's, if they can figure out

815
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,424
how to make it work
here for everybody.

816
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:43,661
Absorb all the people flooding
in from all over Africa,

817
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:45,095
continue to make Mandela's dream

818
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:48,433
a reality, maybe there's
hope for the rest of us.
