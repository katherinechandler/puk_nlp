1
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,358
Let us take you now...

2
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:29,330
To the island of short memories

3
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,965
and the small village
of fat hopes.

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,870
It hardly featured on any map.

5
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:40,941
But, thanks to the civil war
of lies,

6
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,876
the small village
of fat hopes had grown

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,445
in importance

8
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,947
for all the wrong reasons.

9
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,385
They spoke in color
in the village

10
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:54,222
as they did in most parts
of the country.

11
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:59,460
The cost of living
made people purple.

12
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,963
People often felt marooned,

13
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:08,536
and the jokes were always black.

14
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:14,942

15
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:20,481

20
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:21,041
The war is over.

21
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:29,049
At the old hotel,

22
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,285
the 50 caliber
in the tower next door

23
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,689
is wrapped up and attended
by one sleepy guard.

24
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,360
The main enemy today
is not the soldiers,

25
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:44,965
guerillas, fighters, and
suicide bombers of the LTTE

26
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,700
but the black crows

27
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,869
who hover ominously
over the breakfast buffet

28
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,003
on the veranda.

29
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,910
A man with a slingshot
patrols the lawn,

30
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,380
driving them away
with an occasional shot.

31
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,932
Colombo, capital city
of Sri Lanka.

32
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,769
Unlike the last time I came here

33
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,737
nearly a decade ago,

34
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,674
this South Asian island nation
of 20 million

35
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:31,111
does not feel on lockdown.

36
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,447
There are no longer
the military checkpoints

37
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,616
and heavy equipment,
sandbags or barbed wire

38
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:40,187
in between the airport
and the center of town.

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,424
There's a new democratically
elected government

40
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:48,262
voted in by a coalition
of former adversaries.

41
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:51,965
Everywhere you look,
construction, expansion,

42
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,467
new hotels, foreign money,

43
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,837
something that looks
a lot like hope.

44
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,941
Hundreds of thousands
of dead and missing later,

45
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,643
the country is at peace,

46
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,379
and we can go where we want.

47
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:08,816
Hopefully, people will be able
to talk about their lives.

48
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,319
Last time, they couldn't.

49
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,390
So this is the Galle Face Green.

50
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,392
It used to be a place
for the English families

51
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,828
to come and hang out on Sundays.

52
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,896
And it was also the home

53
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,832
of the first golf course
in Sri Lanka.

54
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,634
This is our Central Park.

55
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:27,668
Ah.

56
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,030
What are we eating today
by the way? What's good here?

57
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,166
So this is all
Sri Lankan street food.

58
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,469
These kitchens are run
by Muslims.

59
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:05,038
So, there's no pork dishes.
A lot of seafood.

60
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,376
Dharshan runs several
popular Colombo restaurants,

61
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,644
including The Ministry of Crab.

62
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:14,548
When not catering
to the needs of his customers,

63
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,717
he enjoys simpler fare.

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,250
♪

65
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,563
So what distinguishes

66
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,965
Sri Lankan cuisine and Indian?

67
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,202
I think our curries are lighter,

68
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:39,239
and I think it's the access
to seafood.

69
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,975
If you look at Mumbai,
it's 20 million people.

70
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,077
The ocean's under pressure.

71
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,847
Here it's so clean
we can have access

72
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,248
to great seafood any time.

73
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,883
When did the war get bad?

74
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,152
It got really bad
I think 2005 onwards,

75
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,253
it was really bad.

76
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,656
Yeah, we were last here

77
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,057
in 2008.

78
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,692
I mean, just to get
to the hotel,

79
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,894
I remember, from the airport

80
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,329
we had to go through

81
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,832
one security cordon
after another.

82
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,567
During those times,
we had no idea

83
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,835
when it was going to end.

84
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,370
I've done business
in this country

85
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:13,040
never knowing what
a peaceful time would be.

86
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,389
How long have things been quiet?

87
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:32,626
Well, the war ended in 2009.

88
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,061
It's been eight years.

89
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,630
It takes time for things
to happen.

90
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:37,798
Things have happened though.

91
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,299
The city's not overgrown.

92
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,901
We aren't overpopulated.

93
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,603
The oceans are still clean.

94
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,472
Whatever the underlying
problems were,

95
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,207
do you think they are
being addressed

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,476
or will be addressed?

97
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,911
I think they are
being addressed.

98
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,379
Maybe a bit slow.

99
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,314
But I think you will
find a difference.

100
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,883
So the world has changed,

101
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,885
and it's great to see
stuff like this.

102
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,788
♪

103
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,461
Evening fell

104
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:10,263
upon the small village
of fat hopes.

105
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,965
Suddenly, they heard a noise

106
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,502
that filled them with dread.

107
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,523
Ah! Ah!

108
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:52,573
There was honestly
such a culture of fear.

109
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,846
An incredible amount
of self-censorship.

110
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,715
We had death squads,

111
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:05,553
people, journalists,
so many being disappeared.

112
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,858
This kind of white van
phenomenon

113
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,160
where, you know, your loved
ones were taken from you

114
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,228
and you never heard
from them again.

115
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,498
They're still so many
of those cases going on,

116
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:23,070
and just a real feeling of fear.

117
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,874
From 1983 until 2009,

118
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,341
Sri Lanka's bloody civil war

119
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,544
divided the island in two,

120
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:32,646
splitting the country
along religious lines...

121
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,915
Buddhist Sinhalese majority
in the South

122
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,918
versus Hindu Tamil minority
in the North.

123
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,588
Years of mistreatment
and suppression

124
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:43,356
led to the formation
of the LTTE,

125
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,726
or Liberation Tamil Tigers
of Eelam

126
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,196
and their campaign to seek
an independent state.

127
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,905
The conflict ended in 2009,

128
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,608
but an enormous number of
internally displaced persons,

129
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,776
or IDPs as they were
referred to,

130
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,578
remain in refugee camps.

131
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:07,114
Ladies and gentlemen,
appearing now

132
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,282
and before it is too late,

133
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:13,621
the traveling circus
of refugees.

134
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,465
Colombo native Tracy
Holsinger is the founder

135
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,868
of Mind Adventures
Theatre Company.

136
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,970
Not long ago,
to even talk politics

137
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,906
let alone stage a play
deemed controversial,

138
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,608
could be dangerous.

139
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:37,144
The play that you've been doing

140
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,280
came from a book or...

141
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,750
"Speaks in Numbers"
by Mike Masilamani.

142
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:46,654
It was first performed
in November 2009.

143
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,956
- Controversial would you say?
- A little.

144
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:53,060
The play is about
internally displaced people.

145
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,795
After the end of the war,

146
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:59,466
we had over 300,000 people
in camps.

147
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,334
The largest one of them

148
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,737
was built to house
100,000 people

149
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:07,641
but ended up housing
227,000 people.

150
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:11,178
Tents that were designed for
maybe five people to be in

151
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,147
had 10 to 15 people in them.

152
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,149
There were no toilets
in the camp.

153
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,318
There were just these big pits.

154
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,987
Living conditions
for these people

155
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,922
was intolerable.

156
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,325
There are some communities,
Anthony, in this country

157
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,594
that have been displaced
for 25 years.

158
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,863
That means since the '80s

159
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,364
they haven't had a home.

160
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,267
Hurry up!
Don't waste my time.

161
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,269
What's in the bag?
It's just some-

162
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,371
- Can't take anything
inside the camp.

163
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,808
Search this.
Hurry up, next!

164
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,043
It's a play that was staged
at a time

165
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,378
when all this was so raw for us.

166
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:49,549
And there is no way
to speak directly

167
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,284
about what happened.

168
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,721
I think it's still
very difficult

169
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,223
not just for us
but for people to acknowledge

170
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,391
that these terrible things
were done

171
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:02,062
to part of our community
and our people.

172
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,231
Was this a perilous thing to do?

173
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,266
And how was it seen at the time?

174
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,137
You know, I didn't think

175
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,239
about whether it was
perilous or not,

176
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,641
and that's probably bad on me

177
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,344
because I involved
all these other people.

178
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,079
That scene is done.
We're moving on.

179
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:23,216
For me, the important thing
was making sure

180
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,019
that in whatever form
it got out there

181
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:29,422
the play's out there
and it reminds people

182
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,524
that this happened.

183
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,693
We found the person responsible

184
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:37,931
for trying to poison the minds
of all you good people

185
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,399
with these lies!

186
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,402
She was sleeping amongst you.

187
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,105
Living amongst you.

188
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:48,441
And there are many others
like her.

189
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,745
Let this be a lesson to you all.

190
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:55,348
This is how we deal
with traitors.

191
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,017
Take her away!

192
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,953
No, please, please.

193
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:00,954
- No!
- Please!

194
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,063
So, are things getting better?

195
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,298
I would say in one sense

196
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,767
we're not so afraid.

197
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,903
You're not afraid to speak out.

198
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:19,639
But also I wouldn't say
everything is wonderful.

199
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,110
It's not... I think things
are slowly being pushed,

200
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,412
but it's too slow.

201
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,314
So, 20 years from now,

202
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,316
are you optimistic, pessimistic?

203
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,851
What do you think?

204
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,616
Sri Lanka,
formerly known as Ceylon,

205
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,586
was once the crown jewel
of the spice trade.

206
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,690
Its cloves, cardamom,
pepper, nutmeg,

207
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:14,794
mace, ginger, cinnamon,
chilies, and curry...

208
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,265
...the envy of the world.

209
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,134
These spices built empires.

210
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,506
Wow.

211
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,141
- Chicken curry.
- Marvelous.

212
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,543
Then you have potatoes
that are spicy.

213
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,179
- Right.
- Then you have the beets.

214
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,882
This is one of the traditional
samples of Sri Lanka.

215
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:35,849
Right.

216
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,051
Kumar Lopez is a Tamil

217
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,053
who works for the Sri Lankan
Press Institute.

218
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:43,790
We sit down for lunch at
a local rice and curry joint.

219
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,460
So, last time I was here
was nine years ago.

220
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,229
Things have changed a lot.

221
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,830
I think, yes.

222
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,665
I think the fact that
we're able to eat today

223
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,402
without even thinking
that there could be a bomb

224
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,170
that could go off at any moment

225
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,173
is the best peace
that you could expect.

226
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:02,475
But I believe that peace
can go to another stage,

227
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,077
another level.

228
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,346
In the mindset of those
who have been impacted

229
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,847
by the war,

230
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,516
I think there needs to be

231
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,952
further work to be done.

232
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,422
After World War II,

233
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,057
the British left Sri Lanka.

234
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,692
Over time, the Buddhist
Sinhalese majority

235
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,428
both excluded and repressed

236
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,430
the mostly Hindu Tamil minority

237
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,598
channeling populist fervor

238
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,568
to turn discrimination into law.

239
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,005
What is the generally accepted
underlying reasons

240
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,941
for the conflict
in the first place?

241
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,276
The main cause
or the main objective

242
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,512
was to have a separate land
for the Tamils.

243
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,081
The underlying reason
for that being

244
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:44,284
there was discrimination,
there was racism,

245
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,220
and that basically brought them
to this stage.

246
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:51,124
By 1983, the situation
reached its boiling point.

247
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:55,362
The LTTE began waging
what would become

248
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,230
a 25-year guerilla war

249
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,599
before government forces
crushed them

250
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,935
in a brutal final offensive.

251
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,304
I mean, the war was won
militarily.

252
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,573
Is everybody speaking now?

253
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,977
I think the underlying objective

254
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,080
is definitely to bring about
lasting peace.

255
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:16,984
They actually encouraged
some of the [indistinct]

256
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,987
To invest in the market
to give job opportunities.

257
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,722
So, peace is something
that everybody is looking for.

258
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:28,628
So, I'll be taking
the train to Jaffna shortly.

259
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,397
This is a big deal.

260
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,665
Oh, it wasn't running
probably for the last 30 years.

261
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,402
Whoa, whoa, it hasn't
been running for 30 years?

262
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,504
Right, not been running
a minimum of 20 years.

263
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,299
- Because of the conflict?
- Because of the conflict.

264
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,273
Wow.

265
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,372
With the war over,

266
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,542
Sri Lankans can now travel
freely across their country

267
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,945
all the way north to Jaffna.

268
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,281
Last time, we couldn't go there.

269
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,217
Today, we will.

270
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:32,359
Early morning, Colombo Station.

271
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,167
The platform's bustle
is a mix of commuters,

272
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,936
long distance travelers,
and the occasional tourist.

273
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,886
Breaking free from Colombo's
gravitational pull,

274
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,389
the landscape opens up.

275
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,261
The second and third class
compartments

276
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:45,165
host a mix of people, smells,
and slices of life.

277
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,376
Commuters get on at one station,

278
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,411
off at another.

279
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:02,048
Others like me
are in for the long haul,

280
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,251
ten hours to Jaffna.

281
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,333
That the Jaffna Queen
runs at all

282
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:24,237
is a symbolic move
towards reunification.

283
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,006
As the fight for an
independent Tamil state

284
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,309
in Sri Lanka's north
intensified,

285
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,778
the LTTE destroyed these tracks.

286
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,646
For the last two decades
of the war,

287
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,317
Jaffna was all but cut off
from the rest of the world.

288
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,628
♪

289
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:54,501
The LTTE, unable to match
the military might

290
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:55,868
of the Sri Lankan Army,

291
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,137
fought their war by other means,

292
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,707
every means
they deemed necessary.

293
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,844
Acts of terrorism,
suicide bombings,

294
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,313
political assassinations

295
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,980
brought government retaliation.

296
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,218
And collective punishment

297
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,186
of an equally terrible kind

298
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,188
and enormous in scale.

299
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:19,058
The North suffered
massive bombardments

300
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,560
of civilian areas.

301
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,028
Hundreds of thousands of Tamils

302
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:25,064
ended up in refugee camps.

303
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,733
By the time it was over,

304
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,168
war crimes had been committed
on both sides,

305
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:33,406
those caught in the middle
paying the ultimate toll.

306
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,576
In the final weeks alone,

307
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,545
at least 40,000 people
were killed

308
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:42,114
in a war the outside world
knew little of.

309
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,233
Nearing the end of the line,

310
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,502
weary passengers awake
to find themselves

311
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,271
in a different world.

312
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,273
Out the window, the air is thick

313
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:09,476
with the smell of salt and sea.

314
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,176
Jaffna is about as far north
as you can go

315
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,846
without hitting India.

316
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,148
This is the homeland

317
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,584
of Sri Lanka's
Tamil ethnic minority

318
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,852
and during the civil war

319
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:30,056
base of the LTTE Tamil Tigers.

320
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:37,397
Remnants of the conflict
are hard to miss.

321
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,058
But on any given day
down by the coast,

322
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:07,560
the fish market buzzes,

323
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,896
a hive of activity and commerce.

324
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,401
Fresh product comes in,

325
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,869
deals are made,
money changes hands,

326
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,905
life goes on.

327
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,510
Initially before the war,

328
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:27,079
the North and East
contributed 40% of the GDP.

329
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:29,015
- And now?
- Three percent.

330
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,750
There were so many
industries here.

331
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,385
Everything was destroyed.

332
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,554
There was no electricity
for a long time.

333
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:37,424
I had a coconut farm,
about 100 acres,

334
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,660
and it was completely destroyed
during the war.

335
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,696
There's not even a single tree
with a bullet hole.

336
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,599
Like many Sri Lankan Tamils,

337
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,100
Janna was born here

338
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,902
but with considerable regret

339
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,371
spent much of his life abroad.

340
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:55,074
The fighting has stopped.
Absolutely, that's true.

341
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,509
What's changed?

342
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,445
A lot of things
have been rebuilt.

343
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:03,249
Slowly now they are focusing
on rebuilding infrastructures.

344
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,452
They are renovating
all these ponds

345
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,420
and lagoons,

346
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:09,889
and now slowly business
is thriving

347
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:13,626
in this part of the country.

348
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,127
The underlying discontent,

349
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:17,196
the given reasons for the war,

350
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,032
is there a sense that
those problems

351
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,367
are being addressed?

352
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,970
The war was very brutal,

353
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:28,441
and people after 30 years
everybody's tired of it.

354
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:33,145
We have a very affected
population.

355
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,548
There are about
30,000 war widows

356
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,818
and close to 25,000
orphaned children,

357
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:43,590
about 15,000 people
who were landmine victims.

358
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:46,425
From the government side,
they are still a bit scared

359
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:49,562
that there may be
war popping up again.

360
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:53,600
But slowly now they are
addressing issues

361
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:56,503
like employment-wise,
opportunities-wise,

362
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,337
and there are a lot
of occupied lands.

363
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,007
Now they are slowly
giving it back.

364
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,341
So, hopeful?

365
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,511
Yeah, I see the progress.

366
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:07,647
What I see here
is the human resilience,

367
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,950
like after going through
this war for 30 years,

368
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,853
how quickly people here
can rebuild.

369
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:31,897
So, what's happening today?

370
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,706
First of all, where are we?

371
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,543
This is a Kali temple.

372
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:38,010
And Kali is?

373
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,979
Kali is the destroyer of evil.

374
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,380
People go and pray

375
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,616
and have Kali temples
in villages

376
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,786
because it destroys evil power.

377
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,887
Both good and bad?

378
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,722
- Yes.
- Protector?

379
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:52,391
- Protector, destroyer, yes.
- Destroyer.

380
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,662
Because Kali's also known
for courage and valor.

381
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,230
Like when people go to war
and things like that,

382
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,567
they go and pray to Kali

383
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,235
to give them the confidence
and the courage

384
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,904
to go and fight.

385
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,585
After decades of
cultural suppression,

386
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:20,887
Tamils take great pride
in their customs,

387
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,823
traditions
and religious festivals.

388
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,432
Around here, the Madai Festival

389
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,367
is the most auspicious day
of the year

390
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,670
for Hindus to balance
their spiritual debts.

391
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,773
Believers show devotion
through suffering,

392
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:43,409
enduring acts
of great pain and hardship

393
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:47,313
called kavadis
or the burden debts.

394
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,455
Kavadis can take many forms.

395
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,457
You can make a pilgrimage
to the main temple

396
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,893
on shoes made of nails.

397
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,797
Or roll there on the ground

398
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,934
often for a distance
of several kilometers.

399
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,435
These are some of the ways

400
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:12,104
believers express gratitude
to Kali

401
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:13,906
or implore her for help.

402
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:19,746
Ritualistic body piercing
is another such expression.

403
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,773
It's a very interesting thing.

404
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,776
They prepare for a long time...
28 days, they fast.

405
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:53,312
And they condition themselves
mentally.

406
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,847
And when they come
to the temple,

407
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:57,684
and there's a special ceremony
which takes place.

408
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:01,153
And they kind of chant
and play drums and everything,

409
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,155
so you get into a trance.

410
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,970
The greater the pain,
the greater your dedication

411
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,772
to your higher power.

412
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:24,711
Well, let's just say
viewer discretion is advised.

413
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,908
The islands off Jaffna's coast

414
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:37,743
were holdouts during
the Tamil resistance

415
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,678
and saw heavy fighting.

416
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,082
The people who remained,
like the landscape itself,

417
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,616
bear heavy scars.

418
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,352
This was a conflict that left

419
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,521
more than 80,000 women widowed.

420
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,958
The whole island is very quiet.

421
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:54,193
You do not see shops
filled with people

422
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:57,163
or children playing in yards

423
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,364
or people in fields.

424
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,532
It felt very, very, very quiet.

425
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:03,469
Is that a good quiet
or a bad quiet?

426
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,938
It's an area that has been
severely depopulated

427
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:08,174
as you would have noticed
when you came here.

428
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:11,210
Now, when you say depopulated,

429
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,279
people fled, people were killed,

430
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,680
people were disappeared.

431
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,663
Within three hours in 1991,

432
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:35,968
the entire area was evacuated
of its population.

433
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:38,337
People have only started
coming back

434
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,907
to live here
relatively recently.

435
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,010
A very small percentage
of the original population

436
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:45,577
that has come back.

437
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:50,182
In Tamil society
as in much of the world,

438
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:53,052
women have few rights,

439
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:57,756
no official system
to look after or support them.

440
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,359
The North Ceylon
Community Project

441
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:01,994
seeks to address that problem

442
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,829
providing a home and training
for women

443
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,731
who might otherwise
be living on the street.

444
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,733
Guari is from this area

445
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,202
and one of the organization's
benefactors.

446
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:13,372
Culturally, a woman
who's a widow

447
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,341
who has lost her husband

448
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,244
is a total social outcast

449
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:19,578
and becomes terribly vulnerable

450
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,680
to all other types of abuse

451
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,975
because they have no source
of income.

452
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:24,383
They have no one
to protect them,

453
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,018
no one to look after them.

454
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:28,787
So this organization has grown

455
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,590
to be a safe haven.

456
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:45,037
Now, you provide
food, shelter, job training,

457
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:48,307
some road
to financial independence?

458
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,143
When they come here,
they are given a place to stay.

459
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:54,947
There also is a group of them
who come here for daily work.

460
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,882
And there are different projects

461
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,986
that are skills training
projects for the women.

462
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:03,222
Within this space, they're
given the strength, the skills,

463
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:07,226
and the opportunities
to change their lives.

464
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:39,358
So, why stay? I mean,
it's an obvious question.

465
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,626
So many have left.

466
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,128
Why stay here?

467
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,863
Where you come from
is very important.

468
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,532
So I think in this culture

469
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:49,635
it is about where your
roots are,

470
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,637
where your family history is.

471
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,772
What about these kids?

472
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,209
When they're 16, 17, 18.

473
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:59,011
They are going to finish
their education,

474
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:01,180
and then they're going
to be looking for jobs.

475
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:04,550
And those jobs are not
materializing in these areas.

476
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,219
So, in the past
a number of young people

477
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:10,722
would find ways and means,

478
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,124
often very risky ways and means,

479
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,959
to leave Sri Lanka
and go abroad.

480
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,795
So, unless there is
some really serious efforts

481
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,832
to revive economic activities
and investment,

482
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,169
life is going to be
very tough for these kids.

483
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:43,255
Ask anyone in Sri Lanka
where to find the best food,

484
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:46,525
and they'll say "Nobody cooks
as well as Auntie."

485
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,394
And it's true... trust me.

486
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:50,729
Often possessing
the strength of ten men,

487
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:54,366
Sri Lankan aunties are a force
to be reckoned with.

488
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:30,469
Jaffna crab curry

489
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,070
might be, for me anyway,

490
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:34,573
the holy grail
of Sri Lankan cuisine.

491
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:37,709
Spicy and fiery,

492
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:41,012
in a cuisine known for being
spicy and fiery already.

493
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,483
During the war years,

494
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:47,586
it was hard to get crabs
like this and still is today,

495
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,255
the majority being exported

496
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:51,123
to other parts of the country
and abroad.

497
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:53,392
But, in this time capsule
of a home,

498
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,462
it might as well still be 1953.

499
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:58,397
I've been invited here
by Dr. Ravi,

500
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,899
his sister, Giva,
and their beloved auntie,

501
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,734
best cook in the family.

502
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,336
So there we have it.

503
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,938
Welcome to Jaffna.
Welcome to paradise.

504
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,807
Thank you. Thank you.

505
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,476
These are delicious, by the way.

506
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:13,245
- They're great, aren't they?
- Wow. Are they toasted?

507
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:16,081
They're dipped in yogurt,
dried, sun-dried.

508
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,950
Wow. This is
a beautiful home.

509
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,286
Thank you very much.

510
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:22,020
Built in the '30s?

511
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,123
In the '30s
or late British period.

512
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:28,694
How is it that this
remained in the family

513
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:29,995
that you were able to hang on

514
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,530
and you're still here?

515
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:34,533
During the war,
the Tigers lived here,

516
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,636
and then the Sri Lankan Army
lived here for a little while.

517
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,272
My father kept coming back here

518
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:44,210
making sure he made
his presence known.

519
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,278
I think the thing is
that it was...

520
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:51,517
It has a lot of,
you know, family stories.

521
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,385
So, even a lot of my cousins

522
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:56,888
have a great attachment
to this house.

523
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,228
Can I get you some more
crab curry?

524
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,029
Please, thank you.

525
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,666
Thank you, so beautiful.
Thank you.

526
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,067
So delicious.

527
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,737
I've been to a lot of places

528
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,906
just after really awful,
awful conflicts.

529
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,211
Some nations, there's
a simmering and boiling sense

530
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:22,080
of injustice, rage, humiliation,

531
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,850
particularly when you have
large groups of young people

532
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,918
unemployed, wandering around.

533
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:30,389
Do you think there's
any possibility

534
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:33,091
that if everybody doesn't
get the recipe right

535
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,662
that we could see
another generation

536
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,164

because my generation,

539
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,604
they certainly don't want
to go back to...

who have forgotten the horrors.

You go back to AK-47,

I think I am optimistic,

547
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,049
but I think that
one of the first things

548
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,525
that we need to build on now

549
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,361
is to build a trust
amongst the people.

550
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:12,931
There are lots of IDPs still
still in camps,

551
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,633
and they could be given back
their lands

552
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,969
that might be useful
to also jump start the economy.

553

It should be a paradise, yes.

What do you think?

560
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,003
You have to be optimistic.

That's what... there's where
we have to connect

Sri Lanka has been through
and endured a lot,

far more than most.

577
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,558
It's a lot to ask of any place

to put aside such things
as hate, fear,

579
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:51,797
a desire for revenge.

580
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,565
It might still be too much,

581
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,368

during the war? Could you fish?

- Yes.
- Straight through?

591
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:25,497
They only have
to get the permission.

592
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:28,434
Then they're limited
for one kilometer.

593

so painful and so vicious,

usually at the end of the day

607
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:13,612
people cannot say,
"Look, I'm exhausted."

608
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,313
Nobody wins here.

609
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,882

Ingenuity.

620
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:45,010

terrorism, destroying terrorism.

622
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,082
They never value the strength

- Yeah.

- That's the story.
- It's a little depressing, no?

- How about a message of hope.
- Yes, yes, yes.

627

Come on, let's talk about it.

628
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:20,211
Okay, all right,
and then one day

629
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:24,149
the civil war of lies
came to an abrupt end.

630
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:27,786

631
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,387
Harsh question:

00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,291
Why should Americans
watching this,

633
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,126
why should we give a shit?

634
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,729
Why should people care
about Sri Lanka?

635
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:40,465
I guess...

636
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,401
I don't know why Americans
should care.

637
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,071
I just want Sri Lankans to care.

638
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:49,040

639
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:51,142
and for it to go on

640
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,912
we have to have some hope.

641
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:59,184
Citizens were asked
for what they most desired.

642
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:01,419
And that is how peace came

643
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,690
to the island of short memory.

644
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:06,758

that it didn't matter who won
or who lost

646
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:14,099
because in the end

647
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:16,401
they were all on the same side.

648

my first theatre teacher

669

His abduction wasn't the first,

671

What's in the bag?
It's just some-

684
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,272
- Can't take anything
inside the camp.

00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,174
Search this.
Hurry up, next!

686
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:13,444
This play is in part
acknowledging what happened.

687
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,947
It is a record that
these terrible things

688
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:17,783
happened to the people
of our country.

689

But it is also trying
to offer some hope,

690

691
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,860
that our company in general
and the play especially

692
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:30,228
is trying to say.

693
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,330
Never again.

00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:41,439
What are we eating today,
by the way? What's good here?

695
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,475
So all these kitchens
are run by Muslims.

696
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:45,911
So there's no pork dishes here.

697
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:47,445

698
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,047
Look out the window.

699
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,983
Two of my restaurants
work on no freezers.

700
00:45:52,017 --> 00:45:54,786
We can have access
to great seafood any time.

701
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,256
That's a big cuttlefish.
Put him on the table.

00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,558
Crabs.

703
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,794
I will definitely take
one of those, thank you.

704
00:46:02,828 --> 00:46:05,763
It's delicious.
That is insanely good.

705
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:09,400
This is, what,
a rice and curry restaurant?

706
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,136
It's a typical Sri Lankan meal.

707
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:14,505
Big heavy earthenware vessels
filled with delicious things.

708
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:15,773
Yes.

709
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,443
You have the vegetables, spicy,

710
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,979
the chicken curry,
the fish curry.

711
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:25,616
I have three dogs,
and they don't eat dog food.

712
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,018
- No.
- They only eat curry.

713
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:29,754
