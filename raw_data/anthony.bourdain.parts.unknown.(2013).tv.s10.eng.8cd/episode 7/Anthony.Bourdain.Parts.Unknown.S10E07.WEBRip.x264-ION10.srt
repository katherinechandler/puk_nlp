By God, you can.

00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,900
Oh, I love them.

544
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:29,660
Which is a bread in
the sense it uses yeast...

545
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,400
- Yes.
- And we canned them.

ChefSteps, a high-tech outfit

602
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,300
dedicated to help people
cook better

603
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,033

and interactive content.

605
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,693
Essentially the way
we look at it is

606
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
our job is to help people cook,

607
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,693
cook a meal for their family,
cook a meal for their friends

608
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,300
where they're happy and didn't
know they could cook that well.

609
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,000
- Yeah.
- 'Cause we're kind of

610
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,667
technologists, too,

611
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,733
we think, you know, there's
a roll for technology,

612
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:41,867
but there's also a roll
for... for craft

613
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,367
and tradition.

614
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,633
I think there's
an element of uncertainty

615
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:48,533
and risk that is very exciting
to me when I cook.

616
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:50,133
You know, it's
the imperfections in life

617
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,633
that are most interesting.

618
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,900
If everybody knew how to
sauce pasta correctly,

619
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,967
I don't know that
that would make me happier.

620
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,533
The kitchen is a pretty scary
place for a lot of people,

621
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:01,067
and so if... if you can
bring technology

622
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,400
and it takes that fear away
because they know that

623
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:05,060
it's gonna come out well,
they're gonna be happy

624
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:07,067
with the result, that'll
get them to cook again.

625
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,900
Coming from the guys who, you
know, wrote "Modernist Cuisine,"

626
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:12,800
we're trying to find that
21st-century blend

627
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,633
between YouTube and Instagram
and technology...

628
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,400
- Right.
- And tools like that

629
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,200
with the things that
are great about cooking,

630
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:19,800
which is sharing a meal.

631
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,641
I think you're missing
a central dynamic here.

632
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,967
I mean, why do people
Instagram pictures of food?

633
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,633
To share their wonderful
eating experience? No.

634
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,893
It's to make other people feel
bad about what they're eating.

635
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,800
It's like, look, I'm eating
all these incredible crabs

636
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,800
and you're sitting at home
in some, you know,

637
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,333

638
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:37,800
I mean, hopefully.

639
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,667
I mean, Doritos
are pretty tasty.

640
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:55,633

641

that the Pacific Northwest

642
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,000

disproportionally large number

643

00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,500
Yeah.

713
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:34,867
I've always thought the rain
was kind of part of it.

714
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,700
You got to that stretch
from maybe October

715
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:40,733
to February, and by the time
you're in February,

716
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:43,300
I mean, you... you want to... you
want to become a serial killer.

717
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,800
I mean, you know.
That's part of it.

718
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,800
But apparently you can.

719
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:52,467
Is Seattle a teeming hive
of serial killers?

720
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,833
Or am I just an idiot with a
morbidly overactive imagination

721
00:29:55,867 --> 00:30:00,367
and an attraction to
the dark, ugly side of life?

in the region.

We meet at the Shanghai Room

00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,867
a must.

731
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,067
Why does it seem that there's
a disproportionate number

732
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,000
of serial killers in the Seattle
and Washington State area?

733
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,893
Do you have a theory on that?
Well, I don't think

734
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,367
that most serial killers
are... are... went shopping

735
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,633
for areas where they live.

736
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,700
This is just where
they ended up.

737
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,400
- Mm-hmm.

I mean, I can talk to you
about it and all that,
