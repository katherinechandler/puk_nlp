But it became mythical to me.

73
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:39,132
The story is that the family
originally came from Lecce,

74
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,134
and someone got
the sister pregnant,

75
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,870

76
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,072

77
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,307
so they were one step
ahead of the law.

78
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,078

and became laborers

110

the maid was, Palmetta,

111

there was, in fact, a roof
leading to a housemaid's.

114
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:12,660

that was where it happened.

We are low-class Italians.

141
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:15,388
They were
more high-class Italians.

142
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,758
It took years and a lot of money

143
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,294
converting the once-grand
but decaying mansion

144
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,396

You know, when you bought
this place,

146
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,635
is there a sense of vengeance?

147
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,737
I... you know, by then,

148
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,640
"The Godfather" had come out
40 years ago.

149
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,642
No, no, I mean, look.
It's not about the film.

150
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:38,912
It's about...
a historical correction.

151
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,247
There's a saying.

152
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,650
You know what
Italian Alzheimer's is?

153
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:43,984
Do you know what it is?

154
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,153
You forget everything
but the grudge.

155
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,323
This is the only
internal garden in Basilicata.

156
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,325
I don't think
any of the normal people

157
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,927
had ever been permitted
to visit it.

158
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,462
Right.

159
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,230
So I was happy
that normal people

160
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,233
were gonna be here.

161
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,269
"The Godfather" was a weird
experience in my life,

162
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,905
because it was so much
more successful

163
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,641
than I could have ever
anticipated

164
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:10,510
so that I became well-known
around the world

165
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,180
in ways that was
almost embarrassing.

166
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,447
And so when I came here,

167
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,316
they made me
an honorary citizen,

168
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,519
and they had the little
schoolchildren out in a parade.

169
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,955
And if I think about it,
as a new kid in a school,

170
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,758
my greatest fear
was embarrassment.

171
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,427
"Oh, here's Francis.
He's a new student."

172
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,329
"Oh, Francis is a girl's name."

173
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,932
I was embarrassed
in front of everyone,

174
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,433
and I was a total outsider.

175
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,968
And then when I became...

176
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,536
On the other side
of "The Godfather,"

177
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,439
when I became so well-known,
I was also an outsider.

178
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,208
So I've always been an outsider.

179
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,876
What's in there?

180
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,645
- Some lamb chops and...

Matera's cave communities
became, for post-war Italy,

361
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:48,234
a symbol of national
dysfunction, backwardness,

362
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,737
and horrifying
living conditions.

363
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,840
I mean, this is an area
that was known for briganti,

364
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,507
outlaws, bandits.

365
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:59,411
This is was always where,
you know, the losers were sent.

366
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,753
Into the '50s and '60s,

367
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:08,447
this was considered
an embarrassment and a shame.

368
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,256
People lived...

369
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,858
Yeah, because they had
no water, yes.

370
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,393
Ten kids, shitting in a bucket,

371
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,996
up to 50% mortality rate
among children.

372
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,898
Malaria was endemic,

373
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,100
with children begging
in the street

374
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,835
for quinine to prevent it.

375
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,104
They were burning fire
to keep the animals away

376
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,906
as the children were dying.

377
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:30,609
In the 1950s, the population
was forcibly relocated,

378
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,612
leaving Matera's
cave structures abandoned.

379
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,953
And the way they lived,
you know,

380
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:36,182
they were still pagan.

381
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,784
And of course now it's...

382
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:41,553
Because of Mel Gibson
and the Christ movies,

383
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:44,390
because it looks like Jerusalem
at the time of Christ.

384
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,358
And it's strange that, you know,

385
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,560
in a place that had no god,

386
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,629
they shot all the Christ movies.

387
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,965
Jesus incorporated...
Brought the money,

388
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:55,067
and all of a sudden,
this became hip,

389
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:57,536
and people wanted to live
in the caves

390
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,372
and make bed-and-breakfasts
and expensive...

391
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,441
It's expensive to live
in the caves now.

392
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,709
But this is the story

393
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,411
of every beautiful place,
kind of.

394
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,246
It's like, "Let's move
everybody out,"

395
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,648
and then in come the hipsters
and the postcards

396
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,383
and the Airbnbs.

397
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,511
"Thank God
nobody's living here."

398
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:13,953
Because people like you.

399
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,654
You're right.
You're right.

400
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,982
You make it, "Oh,
this looks so wonderful."

401
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,457
I want to go see."

402
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,626
And then they bring
the money in, and...

403
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,796
Oh, my God,
I am selling Airbnbs right now,

404
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,065
right now as we speak.

405
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,667
They put the cross up there.

406
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,303
So up there, you go
to see Christ.

407
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:32,805
And take your selfie.

408
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,343
But it's beautiful.
It's still beautiful.

409
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:40,579
No, I've never seen
a place like this,

410
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,282
not even in Jerusalem.

Our friend Angelo
introduces us to Nonna Maria.

427

What's the difference

428
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,138
between ricotta
and cacioricotta?

429
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,639
Cacio is caciocavallo.

430
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,174
It's a bit smoky.

431
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:44,663
Oh, buonissimo.

432
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,538
Si, si.

433
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:06,318
She's saying she has a priest
to come in every night

434
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,919
to have dinner with her.

435
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:17,129
I originally had in mind,
oh, I don't know,

some polite
dinner conversation...

437

Maybe changing times,
history of the region.

438
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,070
First of all, I guess...

439
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:35,147
But Maria had other things
on her mind.

440
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,685
So I want to know,
what are the differences

441
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:42,088
in character,
in the heart and character

442
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,589
of the Pugliese...

443
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,469
- And the rest of Italy?
- And the rest of Italy?

She's sorry... I mean,
he's sorry that...

and enjoy the ride.

Scusi mi, signore.

449
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,293
Why... is it St. Peter
or St. Paul or both?

No, he was terrible.

Anyways, he's on his way
to Damascus

510
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:26,264
to torture the [...]
out of some more Christians,

511

a blinding light.

513
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,604

514
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:34,406
"I am Jesus, your lord.

the scales fell from his eyes.

519

Yes, but the scales
is like prosciutto.

520
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:48,620
Like, he had prosciutto
in front of his eyes,

521
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:50,021
and it fell down.

522
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:53,124
And then he was like, "Oh."
He was...

523

- You're making me hungry.
- It was a miracle.

00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,270
I mean, look at it.
It's beautiful.

540
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,940
The streets
are incredibly clean.

541
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,675
I mean, I've never seen...

542
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:45,633
Like, when you walk around
the streets, they shine.

543
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:48,680
There's more money.
There's more tourism.

544
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:51,416
But what is this hiding?

545
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,152
Because for me,
when I see perfect beauty,

546
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,988
I always wonder what's behind.
