took shape over a century ago.

for people from
all over the world,

17

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,367
Bad breeding stock.

179
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,667
It's the problem of
inclusion and exclusion, right?

180
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,200
It's the American
problem, right?

181
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,033
It's what Fitzgerald writes
about in "Gatsby."

182
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,900
Who is included, who's excluded?

183
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,900
Who's allowed in, who isn't?
Right.

184
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,233
And that's the worry,
that we're gonna forget

185
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,733
the people that have
lived through it,

186
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,033
and that have stayed here,

187
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,833
and had no choice
but to stay here.

188
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Pittsburgh's Deutschtown is home

189
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,833
to one of the oldest German
clubs in the U.S.

190
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,333
Immigrants founded it in 1854

191
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,800
to preserve a link
to their motherland.

192
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,333
Today, a new generation

193
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:30,967

Justin Severino

as an ode to flesh,
smoke and animal fat,

200
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,167
Maggie Merskey designs and
creates bar programs

201
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,733
at bars and restaurants
across the city,

202
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,633
and Sonja Finn was here
from the beginning,

203
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,667
planting the flag
for farm-to-table cooking

204
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,167

Another world.

211
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,067
I joined a group
of foodie all-stars

212
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,833
about 20 miles outside
of town for a meal.

213
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,700
Are there typical, iconic
Pittsburgher qualities?

214
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,133
You probably worked here
and brag about working here.

215
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,167
You complain about Millennials.

216
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,533
You complain about the people
on the street harassing you.

217
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,167
You don't like
anything new at all.

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,900
- Right.
- You're describing me.

219
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:57,000
The menu is flipping good.

220
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,133
Right in my happy zone.

221
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,000
Racks of pork rib,

222
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:03,300
grilled hearts
of escarole and turnips,

223
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,200
a sauce made from
the pork drippings,

224
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,500
and four types of sausage.

225
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,467
- What now?
- Look at this. Whoa.

226
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,133
- The food's amazing.
- That's titanic.

227
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:14,400
I don't want to speak about
Pittsburgh in a dismissive way,

228
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:19,500
but it was not known
before being what it is today.

229
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:22,667
People are talking a lot
about the food scene here.

230
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,467
'Twas not always so.
What were people eating before?

231
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,133
You know, steak and potatoes.

232
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,167
You know,
living in San Francisco

233
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,833
as a young person in your 20s,
you were going out to eat.

234
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,467
That was really important,

235
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,333
and we all knew
about the restaurants,

236
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:39,160
whether you were in the
restaurant business or not.

237
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,567
- Right.
- And that wasn't Pittsburgh.

238
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,067
When I opened Dinette
in 2008, you know,

239
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,333
I'm expecting people
like me to be coming in.

240
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:49,233
I'm 29. That's who I'm
building this restaurant for,

241
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:51,967
and everyone was...
56.

242
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, my parents' age or older.

243
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,133
You know, I thought to myself,

244
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,333
I'm going to this neighborhood

245
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,233
that's basically desolate.

246
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,300
I'm gonna take this
building that's been...

247
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,467
It's a restaurant that's been
closed for seven years,

248
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,067
and, you know, I'm gonna
do something nice here.

249
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,660
You know, I didn't
expect the reaction I got

250
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,367
from the actual people
that lived around me.

251
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,800
Right.

252
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,467
You know,
which was not positive.

253
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,300
They liked it the way
it was, you know?

254
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,693
That was their life,
and then, you know,

255
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,367
I move in and all of a sudden,

256
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,833
I open this restaurant and
people with nice, fancy cars

257
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,833
are taking their parking spaces,

258
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:32,333
and now I'm a yuppie gentrifier.

259
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:33,700
- Well.
- You know what I mean?

260
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:35,133
You know, own it.

261
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,133
Sometimes it
kind of hurts, right,

262
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:39,500
as a restaurant owner
or small business owner

263
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,900
because there are always haters
out there, and you feel like,

264
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:44,500
okay, so somebody wants me
to be a small business owner,

265
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,400
and take care of my employees,
and then also on me,

266
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:49,467
they're gonna talk
about gentrification, right?

267
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,867
Like, you're just trying
to do your thing.

268
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,300
You're just trying
to do something good.

269
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,667
Right.

270
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,660
And you're trying to do it
for you, and you should.

271
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,200
Yeah, but I don't know.
I mean, for me it's different.

272
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,167
Like, I definitely was thinking

273
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,067
about the neighborhood
when I did it.

274
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,567
Like, I'm not some egomaniac
who thinks that, like,

275
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,400
just putting out
my food is a reason, like,

276
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,167
so everyone can enjoy
the, like, artistry of my food.

277
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,833
That's why I'm opening
a restaurant.

278
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,567
That's not the point.
Well, I mean,

279
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,633
not to disagree with anything
that you just said,

280
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,333
but, like, I didn't open
Cure in Lawrenceville

281
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,800
because I wanted to change
the neighborhood.

282
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,467
I honestly opened Cure
for me 100%.

283
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,967
I was, like,
struggling professionally,

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,533
struggling personally.

285
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:35,133
Cure was all about
satisfying me, like, 100%.

286
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:39,500
If I'm running a high-end
restaurant in Pittsburgh.

287
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:42,900
Who am I employing
as porters, dishwashers?

288
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,500
- Honestly, like, our...
- Students.

289
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,800
Our dishwashers are...
They're white kids.

290
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,133
- No way.
- Yeah.

291
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,567
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

292
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,467
is a big, bright
shining star of an example

293
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,500
of what blue collar America,
I think, was 100 years ago,

294
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:58,300
When we're looking at,
like, who's applying,

295
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,467
we also need to look
at neighborhoods.

296
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,567
The topography
of Pittsburgh is such that,

297
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,667
like, neighborhoods
are separated by...

298
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
- Bridges.
- By bridges and ravines,

299
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:10,000
and this sort of thing
means that, like,

300
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,267
people stay
within their neighborhood.

301
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,700
- Go.
- One.

302
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:17,800
- Go.
- Two.

303
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,800
- Go.
- Three.

304
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,433
Up, two, good.

305
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,133
Everybody's talking now

306
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:34,033
about a Pittsburgh renaissance.

307
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,900
You've got artists coming.

308
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:38,233
There are new restaurants.

309
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,567
Somebody's making money.
Yes.

310
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,867
Money's definitely coming in.

311
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,300
Is it lifting all boats?

312
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,567
No. It is not.

313
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,467
♪

314
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,367
The new Pittsburgh
attracts new people,

315
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,000
but it doesn't change the life

316
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:58,133
for those workers

317
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:01,967
who were left behind
and kind of spit out.

318
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,533
This is the Hill District,

319
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:06,133
traditionally African American.

320
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:09,367
The numbers here do not
indicate a renaissance.

321
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,800
Black homes
take in half the income

322
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,900
of their white neighbors,
and African American youth

323
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,233
are six times as likely
to be arrested,

324
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,033
go through the system,

325
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:22,400
from which many
can never break free.

326
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:25,800
When activist Sala Udin
was growing up here,

327
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,967
the neighborhood was thriving,

328
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,200
the Golden Age Harlem
of Pittsburgh.

329
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,733
They used to call this
city hell with the lid off.

330
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:44,467
The mills ran 24 hours a day.

331
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,467
I grew up at a time when

332
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,733
most adult men
in the neighborhood,

333
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,467
in the morning,

334
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,567
I saw them getting up
and going to work.

335
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,500
My dad, for example,
dropped out of school,

336
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:02,833
but was still able to find work

337
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:06,833
that paid enough
to raise a family.

338
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:08,467
My mother had 12 children.

339
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,233
And your dad was able
to raise 12 kids on that.

340
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:13,700
- That's right.
- Wow.

341
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,067
That was a very
different America.

342
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
That was
a very different America.

343
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,033
- How you doing, Sala?
- Good, good.

344
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:31,967
This is where I live.
This is where I grew up.

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,867
All of this area,
this whole flat

346
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,967
parking lot area that you see,

347
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,467
this is where we lived.

348
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,833
Devastation.

349
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:44,233
They just completely devastated

350
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:46,500
our whole neighborhood.

351
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,533
In the 1950s, the city came up

352
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,967
with a plan to revitalize
the Hill District

353
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,533
by leveling large swaths of it.

354
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:01,967
8,000 residents, including
Sala, were displaced,

355
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,033
and instead of new housing,

356
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:08,133
the land was used
to build a hockey arena.

357
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,200
Difficult, painful memories

358
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:13,700
of what used to be, and now,

359
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:17,467
we see suburbanites coming in

360
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,167
to have a good time,

361
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,800
visit the Penguins.

362
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,967
They don't live here.

363
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,633
They just play here,

364
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:29,900
and they don't know the pain

365
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:34,000
that this playground...

366
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,333
caused.

367
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:51,233
What's the missing
component here?

368
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:56,833
What's missing
is an economic plan

369
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:59,367
that includes everybody,

370
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,500
not just the techies
and the computer geeks,

371
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:05,833
but regular people.

372
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,000
By day,

373
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,167
a mild-mannered
dentist in training,

374
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,867
but at night she becomes,
well, a superhero.

375
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,733
Brittany Baker is a star

376
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,800
of the International
Wrestling Cartel.

377
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,533
Britt! Britt!
Britt! Britt!

378
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,467
Britt! Britt! Britt!
Britt! Britt!

379
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,167
Tonight, she defends her title

380
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,067
in a battle
of the wrestling titans.

381
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,800
Boyfriend, Adam Cole, hopes to
win a championship of his own.

382
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,467
Why do you think it's big here?

383
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,067
In Pittsburgh?

384
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,677
Yeah, what is it
about Pittsburgh that...

385
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,533
Pittsburgh is a big
sports city in general.

386
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,633
We have the Penguins,
the Pirates, the Steelers.

387
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,700
They're so proud
of their sports teams.

388
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:16,633
They're also very proud of
their wrestling organization.

389
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:19,700
Everyone's independent.
No one's, like, contracted.

390
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:23,467
You work where you want to work
and how you want to work.

391
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,633
It's the big town,
small city vibe.

392
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,500
So the fact that it's not
WWE is a point of pride?

393
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:32,400
Yep. To me, wrestling fans
are the most passionate fans

394
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:34,700
of any form of sport
or entertainment.

395
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,133
This is awesome!

396
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:40,200
I will confess to you
that I took a dim view

397
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:42,500
of professional wrestling.
Oh, okay.

398
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,067
Like, ah, it's not real,

399
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,593
it's like there are these
outrageous characters.

400
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,467
I don't get it at all,
and my daughter started

401
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,467
to get really into it
with her best friend,

402
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,033
so I got tickets
to WWE in New York.

403
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:54,867
- Oh, right on.
- And I'd go in, I'm like,

404
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,467
"I want to wear a bag on my head"

405
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,885
because I'm, like,
really embarrassed

406
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,167
to go to this thing.

407
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,967
This is gonna be totally lame.

408
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,633
Well, five minutes
into this thing,

409
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,300
I think, this is like
the greatest show on earth.

410
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,133
Britt! Britt! Britt!
Britt! Britt! Britt!

411
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:11,833
♪

412
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,967
It's physically very,
very demanding,

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,200
and more to the point,
it's super dangerous.

414
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,900
- Yeah, oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

415
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,967
I mean, most wrestlers
get really busted up.

416
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,633
Some of these pile drivers,

417
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,967
neck cranks,

418
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
body slams,

419
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:37,900
you got to be...
Correct me if I'm wrong,

420
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:41,467
you can get that wrong,
it's bad.

421
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,633
Everything can be gone
in a second, yeah.

422
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:46,133
Wrestling is inches
in many scenarios.

423
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,867
Like you said, with,
like, a pile driver,

424
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,833
if you're off
even by a little bit,

425
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:51,167
that could be a broken neck.

426
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,967
- A lot of trust.
- Yeah.

427
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,660
Right before he's about
to go out and wrestle,

428
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,260
I'll always grab him
and be like give him a kiss

429
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:59,967
and like, "Be safe, be safe."

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,400
Every aspiring wrestler,
since the great local hero

431
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:06,300
Bruno Sammartino,
needs nourishment.

432
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,133
In this case, Kielbasa,
sauerkraut, some pierogis,

433
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,167
and a side of molten
mac and cheese.

434
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,967
Oh, I should ask,
are you the heavy...

435
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,667
Is it the heavy or
what's the bad guy called?

436
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,967
The heel.

437
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,467
- The heel.
- Yes.

438
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,160
Are either of you the heel
or are you the...

439
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,467
She's a big baby face.
I'm the big heel.

440
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,033
So baby face is who
everybody wants to win.

441
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,700
- Yes.
- You're a heel?

442
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:30,233
I am.

443
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,733
So what qualities is one
looking for in a heel?

444
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:36,233
It's just being someone
that an audience member

445
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:38,133
either doesn't want to be

446
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,200
or wants to see
get their ass kicked.

447
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,633
- So over-confident.
- Yep.

448
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,467
- Narcissistic.
- Yep.

449
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,733
- Sneaky.
- Uh-huh.

450
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:48,300
- He's good.
- Yeah, exactly.

451
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,133
You got it.
You could be a great heel.

452
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,800
Yeah, you could be
a heel tomorrow, yeah.

453
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,033
Comes naturally.

454
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,567
Is it a sport or is it
more of a cathartic,

455
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,667
emotional experience
because it goes beyond sport?

456
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,333
There's nuance there.

457
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,700
There are tortured souls
who are struggling

458
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:15,033
with the good and evil
in themselves.

459
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,967
- Wrestling is live theater.
- Right.

460
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,567
It's sport.
It's a rock concert.

461
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,300
It's all this stuff
wrapped into one.

462
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,033
I think that when people realize

463
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,700
that pro wrestling
has more in common

464
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,467
with "Game of Thrones"
than it does UFC...

465
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,300
- Right.
- They accept it more

466
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,567
and they appreciate it
for what it is.

467
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:38,900
Come to the Jozsa Corner
where the kolbasz is delicious.

468
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,133
Chunky too. Tasty too.

469
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,300
Make your belly feel so good.

470
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,800
Everybody!

471
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,633
Come to the Jozsa Corner.
Come to the Jozsa corner.

472
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,067
Alexander Jozsa Bodner
fled Hungary

473
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,833
during the Soviet Union's

474
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:55,467
crushing suppression
of their revolution in 1956.

475
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,300
- One more time...
- Come to the Jozsa Corner.

476
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,367
At Jozsa Corner he runs,

477
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,160
what's not really a restaurant
in the classic sense,

478
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,667
but a house party with food.

479
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,033
Classics from the old country
like chicken paprikas,

480
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,733
langos and kolbasz.

481
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:12,967
Cheers.
Salut.

482
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,633
My dining companion is part

483
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,633
of a more recent
wave of immigrants.

484
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:20,333
Jamilka Borges moved here
from Puerto Rico in 2007

485
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:23,300
and began working in what
was then a restaurant scene

486
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,467
that was just getting started.

487
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,733
You spent your
whole life in Puerto Rico

488
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,133
before you came here?
I did.

489
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,733
I moved here, what,
when I was 21,

490
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,467
and, I don't know, Pittsburgh
is, like, really unique,

491
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,467
like in the sense that
everybody knows each other.

492
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,133
It's such a small town that,
like, here you know everyone,

493
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,400
and it's really easy
to make friends,

494
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:49,867
and that made it easier.

495
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,800
What about culturally?
How different?

496
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,067
Oh, cucumber salad?

497
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,633
- Cucumber salad.
- Beautiful.

498
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,533
It's very much like
a really white town

499
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:58,700
that you go to every
single restaurant

500
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:01,833
and, like, it's white males.

501
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,733
People not even
understanding, like,

502
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:07,467
the relationship that we had
as a country with Puerto Rico.

503
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,467
Like, "No, I don't need a green
card to work here," right?

504
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,633
Ten years later,
she was running Spoon

505
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:18,000
and getting national attention
for her Latin-influenced take

506
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,633
on new American food.

507
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,967
Why did you decide to stay?
I wanted to cook,

508
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,367
which I had no clue
what that meant,

509
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,233
and I needed to prove something,

510
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:28,300
like for me, for my family,
for, like, I don't know.

511
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,067
- Spite.
- Yeah, it's spite.

512
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,833
It was like,
"No, like, I'm gonna do this."

513
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,660
- That's a powerful motive.
- It was kind of like...

514
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,133
My family had no clue
what I was going into.

515
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,233
I still remember, like,
my grandma being like,

516
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:40,167
"You're gonna be what?"

517
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,533
I'm Puerto Rican, like,
my grandma's vision was like,

518
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,967
"Oh, you're gonna either cook
for your husband or family

519
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,067
or you're, like,
professional help."

520
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,833
Certainly, when I started
in the business anyway,

521
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:54,200
it was pretty much
a boys' club in the kitchen.

522
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:55,800
What was it like here
when you started?

523
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,500
Was it different here?

524
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:00,500
It was, and I think, to a
certain degree, it still is.

525
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:03,500
Like, this mushroom guy,
he comes every year.

526
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,800
He knows who I am
and I'm like the only person,

527
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,133
like, with a clipboard in white,

528
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,300
and he's still like,
"Can I talk to the chef?"

529
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,367
Right.

530
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
That's me.
I'm on the side of...

531
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,833
Let me smack you
and write "chef"

532
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,467
backwards on your forehead.

533
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:22,700
So who's coming to town now?

534
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,567
I mean, who are your customers?

535
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,300
So, you know, last three or
four years we have been having,

536
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:31,867
like, new move of,
like, 30's, like young,

537
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,500
mid 20-something
to 30-something, like,

538
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:35,900
engineers and, like techies
moving into town.

539
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:39,700
- That's good for business.
- Sure, but...

540
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,200
You seem wary about the future.

541
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,800
Do you think this is a bubble

542
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,467
or do you think
it's gonna keep growing?

543
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,193
I think I'm actually like
a really positive person

544
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,167
and I'm like, I want...

545
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,067
I want it to work, I just...
Yes, I am definitely worried.

546
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,233
I think that the city
is growing fast,

547
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,000
and, like, I don't know

548
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:01,267
if we're able
to keep up with it.

549
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,300
This is not my town anymore.

550
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,467
When I was young and growing up,

551
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,800
I was shooting craps
and chased by the cops.

552
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,967
Now I'm sitting around
with a bunch of people

553
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,800
talking about hops.

554
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,333
This is not my town anymore.

555
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,467
The town of Braddock
is where Andrew Carnegie

556
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,233
built his first steel mill
in the 1870s.

557
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,300
By the turn of the century,

558
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,733
he bought another one
up the river,

559
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:52,133
the Carrie Furnaces.

560
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,367
These smoke and fire
belching behemoths

561
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,467
were the heart of
a steel-producing industry

562
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,400
that spread throughout
the Monongahela River Valley,

563
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:01,800
generating wealth
and power to the few

564
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:05,800
and a decent living to many.

565
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:09,300
When tomorrow comes, you'll
have a better so-called today.

566
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,033
So you're thinking of the day

567
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:14,467
will decide your destiny
and your future.

568
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,700
And if you don't succeed,
it's your own fault

569
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:19,700
because you didn't take
control of what you think

570
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,633
because what you think
is gonna decide what you do,

571
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,700
and what you do is gonna
decide what you get.

572
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:28,233
Now, that's all for today,
folks. Let's go to work.

573
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:30,633
For the last 40 years,

574
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,633
Tony Buba has been
making documentaries

575
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,733
about the fate of the
working class in Braddock.

576
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,133
He grew up here
during the town's heyday,

577
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:38,633
the '40s and '50s,

578
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:41,300
before leaving to go
to film school.

579
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,033
Why did you come back?
Why did I come back?

580
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:45,800
I was gone from
about '68 to about '75.

581
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,233
They I came home,

582
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,800
and I saw everything's
decaying even worse,

583
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,333
and the people I hung out with,

584
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,567
like there's Sal Carulli
and other guys,

585
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,067
they were these
really characters.

586
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,067
Chico pushed the button me.

587
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,633
No one' gonna push
the button on me.

588
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,367
Nobody. Nobody.

589
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
The only guy that can do
that is that guy up there,

590
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:06,567
J.C.
J. C., my man.

591
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,467
There's a lot of
World War II people

592
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,633
that were starting to die off,
and I was really like,

593
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,967
"This is gonna disappear,
and the industry's going away."

594
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,967
So I didn't know what else
to make films about,

595
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,633
so I just started documentaries
and I just wanted to capture,

596
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,667
and get some of these
characters on film,

597
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,167
and make them mythical.

598
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,633
But you stayed in Braddock

599
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,000
because Braddock
was your subject.

600
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,160
It's my subject, and I thought,

601
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,733
"Okay, what if I move?"

602
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,393
If I move to Los Angeles,
maybe I can get a job

603
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,200
in the industry,
but what if I get stuck

604
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,926
working on "Love Boat"
my whole life, you know?

605
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:34,360
Yeah, that would be
the nightmare scenario.

606
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,333
Yeah, exactly.

607
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,967
In the mid-20th century,

608
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,333
the population
of Braddock was 20,000.

609
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:42,867
Today it's down to 2,000,

610
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,467
more than 40% of whom
live below the poverty line.

611
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,700
This is where I went
to Junior High School.

612
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:51,067
- Closed?
- Yeah, closed.

613
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,533
So who's moving in?
Is anyone moving in now?

614
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:55,567
Nobody's moving
into Pittsburgh, actually.

615
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,093
Well, I thought you had
all these tech jobs

616
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,900
coming in, Google and Uber.

617
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:01,467
You know, all that stuff is
coming in but they sort of do

618
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,133
this upbeat bullshit
about people coming in.

619
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:07,533
If it wasn't for some
30,000 immigrants,

620
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:11,967
the population would have
dropped even more.

621
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,133
- Now, this is the brewer.
- Right.

622
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,633
Yeah, they've done
really well with this place.

623
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:20,233
Well, who drinks there?
I mean, are they locals?

624
00:30:20,267 --> 00:30:22,567
No, no, it's too expensive,
$7.00 a beer.

625
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,733
There's people coming in
on bicycles, grabbing a beer.

626
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:27,700
Getting something
from the taco truck,

627
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:29,333
and they want to sort have

628
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:31,033
like, a "The Wire"
experience, you know.

629
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:32,833
"Yeah, I was in Braddock
having a beer."

630
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:35,200
You know, sort of giving
a little cred to their lives.

631
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,567
I don't know,
and it's all sort of,

632
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,133
you know, white businesses.

633
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:43,800
In 1988, the state
classified Braddock

634
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:45,700
as financially distressed,

635
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:48,300
their term for bankruptcy,

636
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,167
a status it still holds today.

637
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,970
This is still working.
This is still working.

638
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,233
It's the only plant working
in the whole Mon Valley.

639
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,967
This is where my dad
worked for 46 years.

640
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,867
The last time I was there
it looked like a spaceship,

641
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,633
it was all so modernized.

642
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:05,700
There's probably 500 people
doing the work of, you know,

643
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:09,233
when my dad was there, 5,000.

644
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,000
So what do you think
it's gonna take?

645
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,467
Or do you think
it's just gonna die?

646
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,467
I think we're in the last
stages of capitalism,

647
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,160
because this is...
You're talking socialism?

648
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,900
Yeah, yeah, I'm talking
socialism, yeah.

649
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:21,400
When the magical workers'
paradise arrives,

650
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:23,500
will Braddock be here?
Will Braddock be here?

651
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:26,233
I wish there was, like,
a simple answer to all this.

652
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,733
I'll die before I actually
see what happens.

653
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:33,567
I'm not gonna know the story,
and it really bothers me.

654
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,033
It's the only thing I hate
about the thought of dying

655
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:38,367
is that I don't know
what the story's gonna be.

656
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:53,567
Braddock, Pennsylvania,
sustained a real traumatic

657
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,667
unraveling that was common

658
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,367
in Rust Belt
communities and towns,

659
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,567
but ours was a particularly
severe example of that.

660
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,067
- Average income?
- We're around $20,000, so...

661
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,900
- Which is...
- Which is substantially below

662
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:08,833
the Pennsylvania average.

663
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:10,826
Yeah, I'll have mothers
that will call me on a Monday,

664
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,467
and, you know, by Friday

665
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,393
they're gonna be out of food
to feed their three kids,

666
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,367
and this happens
quite regularly.

667
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,400
John Fetterman does not look
like your typical mayor,

668
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:20,967
and he isn't.

669
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,633
He came to Braddock in 2001

670
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,967
to help at-risk youth
get their GEDs,

671
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,800
and ran for office here in one
of the most depressed towns

672
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:29,833
in the state four years later.

673
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:33,567
His wife, Gisele, is from Rio,
and she runs a nonprofit

674
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,367
that provides food and
essential supplies for more

675
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,633
than 1,500 families each month.

676
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:42,167
A lot of people
in this country are angry.

677
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,467
They feel that their
anger has not been

678
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,967
acknowledged in any way,

679
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,308
and frankly,
I think they're right.

680
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,800
- Yep.
- There is a sense,

681
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:52,467
particularly in rural,
white America,

682
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,800
of aggrievement
that nobody's listening,

683
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,633
nobody's caring about them.

684
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:00,033
I mean, Western PA
played a pivotal role

685
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:01,833
in helping elect Donald Trump,

686
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:03,367
and he turned Pennsylvania red

687
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,300
for the first time since '88,

688
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,467
and did it so with a margin
of about 44,000 people,

689
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,567
a lot of whom,
as you referenced,

690
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,300
are disaffected Democrats.

691
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,300
Somebody phrased it to me
where it's like,

692
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,133
"If the economy's
not gonna work for me,

693
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,167
then I don't want it
to work for anybody."

694
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,833
How does that manifest itself
on a local basis for you?

695
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:22,333
It's an honor to be involved,

696
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,633
and I hope whoever it is
that's next

697
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,633
realizes that you need

698
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:30,367
to go outside your community's
borders to bring help in,

699
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,367
and that's what
I've tried to do.

700
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,733
That means people like
four-time Super Bowl champion,

701
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,333
Franco Harris,

702
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:38,167
and if you're wondering
how he could help,

703
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,133
you might be surprised
by the answer.

704
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:44,167
Franco and I hope to be
growing medical marijuana

705
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,300
about a block from here.
We put in an application

706
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:50,167
for a large grow facility
here in our community,

707
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,533
which would be a real
economic shot in the arm,

708
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:53,967
and it's been a real honor

709
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,167
to partner with someone
like Franco.

710
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,133
Why is this a cause for you?

711
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:00,133
I'm a believer
in medical marijuana

712
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,000
because of pain management,

713
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:06,067
and I run into many ex-players

714
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,800
who deal with pain management,

715
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,967
and, right now, the
alternatives don't look good,

716
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,500
and we have a lot of problems

717
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:13,926
with the alternatives
that they've had so.

718
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:15,633
There's no doubt about that.

719
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,233
Western PA's been ravaged
by the opioid crisis,

720
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:22,800
and it positions us
for the eventual legalization

721
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,833
of marijuana and...

722
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:26,900
It would also pull
Braddock out of Act 47,

723
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:29,533
so we would no longer
be fiscally bankrupt.

724
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:34,033
Braddock lost its initial bid

725
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:35,900
for a medical marijuana license,

726
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:37,467
but there are a few other

727
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,333
madcap entrepreneurial
efforts in town,

728
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:42,200
lone dreamers with a plan.

729
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:45,800
One such dreamer
is chef Kevin Sousa.

730
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,467
Kevin was the first
of a new generation of chefs

731
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,533
to bring national
attention to Pittsburgh

732
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,133
when he opened his restaurant,

733
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:55,333
Salt of the Earth, in 2010.

734
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:57,033
What are we looking at
here, Chef?

735
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:59,033
- All right, so...
- Beautiful.

736
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:02,700
We are landlocked,
so seafood is tough.

737
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,967
This is Lake Erie Walleye Pike,

738
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,067
some new potatoes from the farm,

739
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,733
some of the crackling
from the fish,

740
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:14,167
took the skin crisped it up,
it's nice and crunchy,

741
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,633
and then just a lot
of little farm herbs.

742
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:18,367
Now, after some bumps
in the road,

743
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,467
he's improbably turning
this building,

744
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,467
a former Chevy dealership,
into his latest restaurant,

745
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,367
Superior Motors.

746
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,800
Opening night is less
than a month away.

747
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,400
Do I have to eat this?

748
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:31,967
I mean, it's too pretty.
It's too pretty to eat. Jeez.

749
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,093
The fish is amazing, by the way.

750
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,467
Oh, thank you very much.

751
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,693
Where were you born and raised?

752
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,233
McKees Rocks.

753
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,883
- You're close to your roots.
- Yeah, yeah,

754
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,067
in locality and in spirit.

755
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,133
Is the restaurant
business any... I mean,

756
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:45,826
'cause I know, you know,
it's been bumpy for you.

757
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,167
It has.

758
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,700
You over-expanded
or over-extended?

759
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:50,333
Over-expanded with no capital.

760
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:52,333
I just thought we were
gonna open the doors

761
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,200
and everyone was gonna
go apeshit

762
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:57,300
for whatever it is
that I served, and I learned.

763
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,967
As serendipity would have it,
I met John.

764
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,233
Asked if I'd be interested in
going for a walk in Braddock.

765
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:06,200
Came out to Braddock.
Fell in love.

766
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,800
- With Braddock, not me.
- With Braddock.

767
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,300
You know, it reminded me of
McKees Rocks, and McKees Rocks,

768
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,967
you know, has suffered much in
the same way as Braddock has.

769
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,500
Kevin says he has ambitions

770
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:20,667
that go beyond turning a profit.

771
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,500
His restaurant hopes to
provide tuition-free training,

772
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:25,733
and they're partnering
with a local urban farm

773
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,200
that employs high school
students to grow produce

774
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,567
in the shadows
of the old steel mill.

775
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,533
And though we are talking
a swank, high-end restaurant

776
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,300
designed to attract the monied
classes from out of town,

777
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:40,467
locals will be offered
steeply discounted meals.

778
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,000
So this is beautiful,
grass-fed beef short ribs

779
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:48,467
sitting on a bed of lightly
blanched milkweed buds.

780
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,700
On top, a bunch of
over-wintered sun choke chips.

781
00:36:52,733 --> 00:36:54,233
- Nice.
- Awesome.

782
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:56,500
That's the compliment
I was looking for.

783
00:36:56,533 --> 00:37:00,067
I was trying to work
that one out.

784
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,467
So what happens
if everything works out

785
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,233
the way you want it to,

786
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:08,367
meaning people are driving
from all over the state,

787
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,467
they're flying in to Pittsburgh
from all over the country,

788
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,200
the parking lot is full,

789
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:17,967
the place is packed
and fully booked every night?

790
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,567
Then what happens?

791
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,467
You're moving towards
the "G" word, and...

792
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,033
No, not yet.

793
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:29,133
Braddock is gentrification
proof, essentially.

794
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:33,567
Our biggest challenge
has been abandonment,

795
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,700
not people being displaced.

796
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:38,167
To directly answer
your question, Chef,

797
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,500
long after I've shuffled
off this mortal coil,

798
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:44,167
the work will never
be done here.

799
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,067
This is a decades' long process.

800
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:03,567
♪

801
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,233
If you head east 30 miles
from Pittsburgh,

802
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:09,733
you'll find yourself
here in New Alexandria.

803
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:11,733
It's a whole other world.

804
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:15,133
No tech incubators here,
or fears of gentrification.

805
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,967
Just good, heartland fun
on a Friday night.

806
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,967
Family, fried dough

a few towns over from here.

Tonight, she's driving

809
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:32,333

So how long you been doing this?

812
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:38,967
Like getting into it?
Like, six years.

813
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,067
And how did it all begin?

814
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,833
Well, my dad, him and my uncle,

815
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:46,733
you know, ran back in like,
the '80s and '90s,

816
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:50,300
and it's just been something
I grew up with, so...

817
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,633
I mean, the only other thing
we really do for fun

818
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:57,567
is, you know, four-wheelers,
RZR Side by Sides, and hunt.

819
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,967
Chris Quenzler's a welder

00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,467
What are the rules as far
as the vehicle itself?

822
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,833
I mean, can you build...
Theoretically you're allowed

823
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:09,800
to build some monster
road warrior, you know, thing

824
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:12,200
with some guitar dude
on the front and, you know,

825
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:14,400
special hidden reinforcement
and spikes and shit?

826
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:17,067
No, it's not "Death Race."
It's not "Death Race."

00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,833
Wait a minute, what's
the difference between male

830
00:39:22,867 --> 00:39:24,200
and female drivers?
Is there any?

831
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:25,900
There's not very many females

832
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:27,333
that actually compete
with the guys.

833
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,033
Yeah, but wouldn't it be great

834
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,167
to see some big meathead
falling to his knees

835
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,300
sobbing after you've
just totally destroyed...

836
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,367
Maybe.
Depends on who they are.

- Okay, yeah, yeah, definitely.
- I mean, come on.

839
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:41,300
- Yeah.
- That would have to be good.

So tonight, are you
gonna be the only girl...

841
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:44,200
Probably I'm the only girl

842
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:45,900
that's running out there
with the guys.

843
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:47,226
Let us hope that tonight
is your night.

844
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:48,700
I'm gonna get another shot.
