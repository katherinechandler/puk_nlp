1
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:07,740
After nine days of threats
of and what was the most

2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,842
chaotic, difficult, yet amazing

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,744
trip of my life, the last thing

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,713
that stands between us and our

5
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:17,584
flight home is the
reason we came.

6
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:25,585
The Congo river itself.

7
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,161
It has to be paid tomorrow.

8
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:31,131
The U.N. Truck said he's been
here since this morning.

9
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:33,200
What's up, Fred, ?

10
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,034
They're starting the engine.

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:35,336
Awesome.

12
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:35,903
Just broke down again?

13
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:37,970
Yeah.

14
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,908
We now have one hour
of daylight left.

15
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,845
They buried the engines
and then... okay great.

16
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:53,753
Here it comes.

17
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,021
You learn quickly.

18
00:00:55,022 --> 00:01:03,022
In Congo, things change
at a moment's notice.

19
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,267
Welcome to the jungle.

Everyone gets
everything he wants.

28
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,455
I wanted to see the Congo.

29
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:10,456
For my sins, they let me.

30
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,805
In "heart of darkness" Joseph

31
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,341
Conrad writes of his alter

32
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,243
ego... when I was a little chap,

33
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,111
I had a passion for maps.

34
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:30,650
At that time there were
many blank spaces on earth.

35
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,752
But there was one yet, the

36
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:37,857
biggest, the most blank, that
I had a hankering after.

37
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:41,027
This then is the Congo.

38
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,531
The size of all western
Europe combined.

39
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:48,668
It should be Africa's
wealthiest nation.

40
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,803
The people forget, or never even

41
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,573
knew, that the 20th century's

42
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,042
first holocaust happened here

43
00:02:56,043 --> 00:03:01,448
when Belgium's king Leopold
managed to bamboozle giving

44
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:09,389
him personal title to the Congo.

45
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,057
Leopold's agents of whom the

46
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,160
mythical Kurtz was one, raided,

47
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,362
slaughtered, mutilated and

48
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:20,333
pressed into forced labor
much of the population, in a

49
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:25,071
bloodthirsty quest for first
ivory and then rubber.

50
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,440
When independence finally came,

51
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,109
the Belgians trashed what
they could, and left behind a

52
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,412
completely unprepared tribally

53
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,714
divided and largely ungovernable

54
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,717
land mass, filled with stuff

55
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,020
that everybody in
the world wanted.

56
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:49,021
And things pretty much
went downhill from there.

57
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:07,507
♪

58
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:22,429
But this story begins
with the truck stop.

59
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,798
In Rwanda.

60
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,900
Stocking up in Rwanda.

61
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,971
My expectations for food in the

62
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:39,972
Congo are more measured.

63
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,583
If you're looking to get to the

64
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,117
eastern Congo action and many

65
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,986
would ask why you would even

66
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:50,089
want to do that, the best way is

67
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,559
to drive across from
neighboring Rwanda.

68
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,461
This country, of course, not too

69
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:58,665
long ago, suffered its
own appalling genocide.

70
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,467
Behind the wheel, Dan.

71
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,168
He's been living in the DRC for

72
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,372
two years, working on a
documentary about some of the

73
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:09,909
several dozen rebel
groups in the country.

74
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,380
Riding shotgun, Dan's close

75
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:19,386
friend and associate
Horeb, a Congolese.

76
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,354
They're taking me
across the border.

77
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:25,024
One side, Rwanda, hotels, paved

78
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:32,799
roads, Internet, and
paperwork to be filled out.

79
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,201
Just a few feet of barbed wire,

80
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:43,202
machine guns and cement
walls away... this.

81
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:54,246
Welcome to Goma.

82
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:59,459
A city of 1 million, the
significant number of whom are

83
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:06,265
IDPs, internally displaced
people... sitting, rather

84
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:12,238
inconveniently, at the base of mt.
Niragango.

85
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,841
Current street level is about 12

86
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,109
feet off 20202, when
it last erupted.

87
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,512
Lava everywhere.

88
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:25,017
Which explains the
less than smooth ride.

89
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,419
One of the first things you

90
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:33,793
notice out the car
window, the U.n.

91
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,063
About four months ago, the m-23,

92
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,364
one of the various rebel groups

93
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:42,401
holed up in the jungle
nearby, invaded the city.

94
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:47,674
The NGOs battened
down the hatches.

95
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:52,411
The U.N. Stood by, hands tied.

96
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,580
Everyone else had to fend for

97
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,247
themselves until
the rebels drew.

98
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,416
The Congo was a place I dreamed

99
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,351
of visiting before I ever

100
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:04,991
thought I would get the
chance to travel the world.

101
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:12,992
The action big here,
I'm not so sure.

102
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:19,238
Dan, Horeb and I head
for a local restaurant.

103
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,007
Good food is going to be a

104
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,775
challenge soon, so we take the

105
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,178
opportunity to fill
up on what we can.

106
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:32,218
Grilled chicken, gugali,

107
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,320
pirripirri pepper,
pretty nice meal.

108
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:40,927
Goma in the '50s, tourists
used to come as far as rho

109
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,595
Rhodesia, up here to vacation.

110
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,263
Amazing life.

111
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:48,334
I remember in my childhood
lions alongside the road.

112
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,369
Goma was a choice
place for some time.

113
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,905
They're not coming anymore?

114
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:56,042
No.

115
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:56,877
It's a red zone.

116
00:07:56,878 --> 00:07:58,945
It's looking like there won't

117
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:02,481
be house to house fighting or

118
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,584
artillery or more
tars dropping in.

119
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,686
Was today a good day?

120
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,155
We have a rebel group just

121
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,258
ten kilometers north of us, and

122
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:12,893
maybe several groups that are

123
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:15,562
all caught in the
blender, you know.

124
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,730
Things change quickly
in the Congo.

125
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,165
Confused yet?

126
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,533
Virtually all of the eastern

127
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,268
part of the country is being

128
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,435
contested by rebel groups...

129
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,037
Some local and others allegedly

130
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,438
acting on behalf of interests

131
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,374
based in neighboring countries.

132
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:34,914
Recently the largely Tutsi
Rwandan backed m-23 has been

133
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:40,887
backed, but the mostly
Hewittu is also here.

134
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:44,490
They can also refer to
self-defense groups or

135
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:47,760
specifically entities.

136
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:51,698
Which groups lie the frpi are

137
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,165
defending a stake like gold, and

138
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,433
the others are mainly interested

139
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,502
in fighting with the particular

140
00:08:56,503 --> 00:09:00,673
enemy, in their case they
have a beef with the fdlr.

141
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,576
Lots of other organizations
controlling territory who

142
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:08,347
haven't come up with a
name or cool acronim yet.

143
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,182
This is only a fraction that a

144
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,818
single area of the Congo.

145
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:15,354
Be advised this map was
hopelessly outdated before we

146
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,624
even got here.

147
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,458
It's all these variables kind

148
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,427
of knotted into one big mess.

149
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,530
These are the reasons why media

150
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,766
has a difficult time, why the

151
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:27,635
western world doesn't hear much

152
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:29,301
about Congo, because how can you

153
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,672
sum it up in a
three-minute report?

154
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,274
About you for us Goma is just

155
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,711
a stopover on the way
to the Congo river.

156
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,513
So we need to keep moving.

157
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,750
And roads, forget it.

158
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,252
Certainly nothing even remotely

159
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,587
safe between Goma and
where we are headed.

160
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:55,795
We're flying so Kisangani,
this is the prefer route.

161
00:09:55,796 --> 00:10:00,499
We chartered the queen's
former 2r568ing wardrobe.

162
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,568
When she traveled in her younger

163
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:06,739
years, we're told her clothes
traveled in this beast.

164
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,574
This is a first for me.

165
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:12,144
You learn to take nothing
for granted in the Congo.

166
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:12,646
Uh-oh.

167
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:19,686
Just as we're about to take
off thunder, lightning.

168
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,153
It looks fine to me.

169
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:28,127
Let's get this thing airborne.

170
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,129
Wow, nice.

171
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,032
Has to wait this
one out a little.

172
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,400
Crashes are pretty commonplace.

173
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,268
Not so long ago a plane with

174
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,270
nearly 100 people on board went

175
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,407
down on the same route
we're taking today.

176
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,275
Most planes crash in Congo

177
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,476
crash because of the
weather, right?

178
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,113
Yeah, most of the time, yeah.

179
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:47,881
Not us.

180
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:48,315
Don't worry.

181
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:50,582
Impossible.

182
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,219
The weather clears up, sort of.

183
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,322
So we decide to give it a go.

184
00:10:56,323 --> 00:11:01,193
When the weather is very
bad, stay on the ground.

185
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,862
What about rebels?

186
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:03,930
Are they shooting at the planes?

187
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:08,501
Normally, no.

188
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:09,002
Okay.

189
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:10,036
We'll see you after your trip.

190
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:10,537
Yeah, yeah.

191
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:18,538
Have a good one.

192
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,986
Lifting off from Goma, we

193
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,856
head out over the shores of lake

194
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:34,693
Kivu before circling
back north-northeast.

195
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:40,199
Our destination... what Conrad
referred to in "heart of

196
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,934
darkness" as the inner station.

197
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:46,305
Here surrounded by dense jungle

198
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,875
lies our ren day view with the

199
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:52,945
Congo river, response both
building this country and

200
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:53,946
helping to destroy it.

201
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:15,861
Two hours off Goma,
we land at Kisangani.

202
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:28,414
It was once Stanleyville, the

203
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,715
second largest city in the

204
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:33,719
country, before war cut it off.

205
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,788
Stanleyville, known in "hard of

206
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:43,789
darkness" as the inner station.

207
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:48,767
The Congo river stretches
across the country's middle.

208
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,069
Conrad describes it as a

209
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,971
twisting snake with its head in

210
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,173
the Atlantic ocean and its tail

211
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:58,277
buried deep in Africa's heart.

212
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,612
To Europeans, it was a natural

213
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:05,017
route to transport slaves,
ivory, rubber, minerals.

214
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,486
The commodities upon which

215
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:11,357
modern-day Brussels and
Antwerp are built.

216
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,625
For the Congolese, both before

217
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:19,498
and after the Belgians, it
provided more basic things.

218
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,100
Water to watch, to clean your

219
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:25,905
clothes in, to cook
with, to drink.

220
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,474
Also fishing.

221
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:32,211
Since long before the expeditions of Dr.
Livingston

222
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:38,150
and Henry Morton Stanley, the

223
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,151
Wageni tribe has been fishing

224
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:45,858
the river in unique fashion.

225
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:52,965
Highly coordinated and
acrobatic, the Wageni dived into

226
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:58,637
the treachery rapids in what
is still referred to as

227
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,472
Stanleyville falls.

228
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,173
Perched on a precarious network

229
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:07,446
of wooden poles,
they hoist together.

230
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:15,447
The catch these
days... not much.

231
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:22,794
So it is the second biggest
force in the Congo river.

232
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:28,134
He was a guide bringing
tourists to his village.

233
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:32,138
Since the last two wars,
Kisangani tourism has been

234
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,408
pretty much nonexistent.

235
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,379
Chief of the Wageni, Pierre mu

236
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:46,152
sala, is said to be a direct
descendant of the king who

237
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:49,255
greeted Stanley in the '70s.

238
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,296
Thank him for the privilege
of seeing his community.

239
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,630
It's a present from the chief.

240
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:05,804
This is a way to welcome
the delegation of CNN.

241
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:09,976
The Wageni tribe made, what

242
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,478
was in retrospect, the mistake

243
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,213
of allowing Stanley to pass.

244
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,148
The famous explorer, of course,

245
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,649
pretty much shot and raided his

246
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,885
way along the historic route to

247
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,988
the coast, before effectively

248
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:29,989
jump-starting the
colonial period.

249
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,699
Using Stanley as administrator

250
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,368
king Leopold of Belgium claimed

251
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:40,339
the Congo as his
personal property.

252
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,542
Under Leopold's reign, men women

253
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,677
and children were tagged with

254
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,580
numbers, separated into groups,

255
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,581
given production quotas.

256
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:53,785
If they fell short, they were

257
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,288
whipped, their hands
cut off, hanged.

258
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,659
An estimated 10 million
Congolese were either starved,

259
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,661
worked to death, executed or

260
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,163
just killed where they stood,

261
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,033
all in just over 20 years.

262
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,268
By the end, half the population

263
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:15,974
of the country was gone.

264
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,177
Have you ever thought about all

265
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,779
those years ago that your if

266
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:27,553

killed Stanley?

267
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,755
Somebody else would have come.

like this one, it's going to the

270
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:37,196
market, considered way
too valuable to eat.

271
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,997
But today... guests.

272
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:44,103
It's a mean-looking fish.

fish in the market.

00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,749
a banana leaf and steamed.

277
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,950
Typical tradition.

278

Excellent meal.

On a good day, how
many of these?

283
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:26,245

00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,142
It was just robbery with

366
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:58,450
violence, aggravated
murder on a great scale.

367
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:06,451
And after 75 years, the
Congolese had had enough.

368
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,593
But independence came quickly.

369
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:11,029
When the new country managed
to inaugurate their first

370
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,065
democratically elected leader,

371
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,967
the CIA and the British working

372
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,169
through the Bellians,
had him killed.

373
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:26,170
We helped to install this
miserable bastard in his

374
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,017
place... Joseph Mobutu, he

375
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:36,254
became pretty much the template

376
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,390
from... by the time chef was

377
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,592
done, the Congo was mired in a

378
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,093
series of civil wars, the

379
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,895
government was no longer paying

380
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:51,837
its bills, and the trains
basically stopped running.

381
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:59,838
This is Kisangani station.

382
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,950
There's one short run left.

383
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:08,386
Service once a week, when

384
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:13,324
operational, which isn't
often, I'm guessing.

385
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:20,666
Abandoned by the Bellians, the

386
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:24,035
station, the engines, the

387
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,037
ancient passenger cars, and the

388
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:34,038
tracks themselves have slowly
receded into the jungle.

389
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,723
And yet all these years later,

390
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:49,561
with hardly any resources, Alub

391
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,262
Emile, the administrator and

392
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,232
staff of clerks, conductors,

393
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,167
mechanics and engineers, show up

394
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:58,069
at work and do what they can in

395
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:05,176
an attempt to keep
things in working order.

396
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,980
How do you do?

397
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,883
He says you're welcome
to see this place.

398
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,120
How many employees
still work here?

399
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:30,368
So at one time you could
dispatch a freight to south

400
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:37,977
Africa?

401
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,247
So a hypothetical question... if

402
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,950
the government said,
okay, we are ready.

403
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,619
We have the money, we would like

404
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,122
to as quickly as possible get

405
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:57,964
operational, does he have
the workers ready to go?

406
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,245
And this is one of the few
things here that's working

407
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,082
today.

408
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:21,587
A feature of great
pride to the staff.

409
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:23,622
The railway employees, I'm told,

410
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:31,623
do not get paid, yet they
continue to show up and work.

411
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:51,016
♪

412
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,318
It is said of the building of

413
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,121
the country's once vast rail

414
00:25:56,122 --> 00:26:04,122
network, one Congolese
died for every single tie.

415
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,106
Like many Congolese we meet,

416
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,008
they are, all these years later

417
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:21,046
and in spite of everything
that's happened, ready and

418
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:29,047
waiting for the
situation to improve.

419
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,207
You lost your way on that

420
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,777
river, as you would in a desert,

421
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:54,445
until you thought yourself

422
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,716
bewitched and cut off forever

423
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,718
from everything you
had known once.

424
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,586
So Conrad described the Congo

425
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:08,827
after piloting steamships in
the early days of Belgian

426
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:09,128
colonialism.

427
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,397
I've somewhat of an obsession.

428
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:13,665
It's been kind of a personal

429
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,567
dream, if you will, to
travel a Congo river.

430
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:20,071
Now, for better or worse,
I get that chance.

431
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:23,241
Wife rented a trusty vessel, and

432
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:29,247
I shall dub they "the
captain Willard."

433
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:30,149
All right.

434
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,550
Did you maggots
load the chickens?

435
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,385
Finding food along the way,

436
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,555
it's anticipated,
will be a challenge.

437
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:40,859
Refrigeration of any
kind is impossible.

438
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,860
Okay.

439
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,328
Well, I'm psyched.

440
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:51,329
My dream has finally come true.

441
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:52,604
Blocked by officials?

442
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:55,807
This could be months.

443
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,309
Okay.

444
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,512
Let the probing begin.

445
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,553
Now, how do we do this?

446
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,856
Let's get under way until

447
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:18,857
they figure a new
tax to Levy on us.

448
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:28,073
Our trip downriver there take us

449
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,241
some 120 kilometers, even deeper

450
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,577
into the jungle, instead of

451
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,179
Kurtz and the crumb ling hoard,

452
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:39,350
with a shadowy past, awaits
us at our destination.

453
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:42,387
It's the turn of the century

454
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:47,859
map, so Kisangani was
then called Stanleyville,

455
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,994
Leopoldville would be here.

456
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:51,629
3,000 kilometers or
something like that.

457
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,866
A long way to go, and
we're taking a full ride.

458
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,634
That's what we're doing, right?

459
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,469
All the way to the Atlantic?

460
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,740
You didn't tell them yet?

461
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:10,741
I don't think we have
enough spam, gentlemen.

462
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,520
A half day's journey downriver

463
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:20,525
there's a local dignitary
we have promised to visit.

464
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:24,863
There's the chief
who is coming down.

465
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,731
We arrive, late.

466
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:30,001
But the king is still
waiting for us.

467
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:33,238
Traditionally headgear,
not so traditional suit.

468
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:36,707
The medals given by the Belgians

469
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:44,708
proven his royal lineage.

470
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:54,092
This place belongs to the
Mombuli ethnic group.

471
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:55,327
He's the king?

472
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:04,369
My father ruled from the age

473
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:09,975
of 8, and I came to him at 1963.

474
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:12,743
That's great history.

475
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,045
Incredible.

476
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:15,680
We gave him a goat for being so

477
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,782
late, I'm sorry we can't stay

478
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:21,286
longer and he gives me a simple,

479
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:22,553
hefty-looking bracelet only

480
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:30,554
later do I come to appreciate
it for what it is.

481
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:41,339
Horeb tells me it goes back

482
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,109
to Arab Portuguese times, they

483
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,343
taught them how to do it.

484
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,614
They wear them on the
wrists and ankles.

485
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,549
It's older than our
story, probably.

486
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:55,786
The chief said his father
gave it to him in 1935.

487
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,854
So who knows, man?

488
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,191
Wow.

489
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,393
So where did you
get the bracelet?

490
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:07,899
Oh, an African king gave
it to me, the Congo river.

491
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:13,271
Where did you get yours?

492
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,673
We've come a long way downriver,

493
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:19,510
with many kilometers
still to go.

494
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,779
Attention has turned
toward the evening meal.

495
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:29,780
Sill figure I'll
make coq Au vin.

496
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:31,356
Getting close to killing time.

497
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:32,590
The moment of truth.

498
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,025
It's quickly getting dark.

499
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,561
I'm very aware of a
number of things.

500
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:40,431
How do they usually
kill chickens?

501
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,133
Small knife.

502
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:46,871
Our chickens are
thin, cragly, tough.

503
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:50,041
He's biting me.

504
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,676
I'm probably going to have to

505
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,980
stew the crap out of them.

506
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:59,484
Still wet to kill these things.

507
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,819
You want to eat, you have to

508
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,291
kill your own chicken
and pluck it, too.

509
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:11,762
But every man has
a breaking point.

510
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,400
In retrospect, perhaps
this was ours.

511
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,335
Harder, harder.

512
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,469
Almost through, man.

513
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,207
No, I'm not.

514
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,508
Clean kill.

515
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:26,244
Now you can join our treehouse.

516
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,379
By the time our birds are

517
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,548
cleaned and plucked, the sun is

518
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:36,687
down and dinner is
still a long way off.

519
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:41,327
♪ Clean out the chickens
♪ it's time to...

520
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:55,506
Somewhere down the Congo
river, I'm continuing to deal

521
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:56,442
with a few pressing concerns.

522
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:58,643
The one knife on board is as

523
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,746
sharp, really, as a soupspoon.

524
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,548
Soon I'm frantically trying to

525
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:08,353
rip out the backbone and
guts, with one hand.

526
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,888
The damn generator
keeps kicking off.

527
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:15,160
I really need light so I
can see what I'm cutting.

528
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,662
I can't cut what I can't see.

529
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,796
There's only 240 watts.

530
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,831
No way it's the draw.

531
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:28,832
They're not going to eat at all.

532
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:34,245
I'm never going to get
through with this.

533
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,547
Machete?

534
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,784
No, maybe we should figure
out how to could be dinner,

535
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:42,620
because we really won't
eat any dinner here.

536
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,423
I've had a peanut butter and

537
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,725
jelly sandwich, and I would like

538
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:51,262
to eat, especially after getting

539
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:55,766
through all this misery
with the chicken.

540
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,034
All right.

541
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,569
This machete... it would be

542
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,571
apropos to point out we do not

543
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,673
want to be moving at night.

544
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,209
We would not like to run aground

545
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,278
in the middle of the
freaking Congo.

546
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,479
Swimming now.

547
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,482
Is he worried about crocs?

548
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:16,587
The current's unpredictable.

549
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:17,489
Visibility nil.

550
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,325
Time to tie up for the night.

551
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:23,228
Generator issues more or less

552
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:26,063
fixed, but now another just as

553
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,499
serious problem presents itself.

554
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,936
With the lights burning,
it becomes insanely buggy.

555
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,305
Crush one of these moths, and

556
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:37,175
you will blow up like a balloon.

557
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,009
Seriously.

558
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,014
Pour all three bottles
of wine into the onions.

559
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:44,716
All right.

560
00:34:44,717 --> 00:34:51,322
Let's put the top on,
bring it up to a boil.

561
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:52,990
Three hours later, it looks like

562
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,693
the jungle-style stew might

563
00:34:55,694 --> 00:35:03,634
actually work out after all.

564
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:03,902
Okay.

565
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:05,370
So who wants to bring this over,

566
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:08,806
carefully, to the table?

567
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:09,074
All right.

568
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:14,879
Let's eat.

569
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,315
Bon apetit.

570
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:24,455
Bon apetit.

571
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:32,456
In the end, my coq awe vin
was scrappy, but tolerable.

572
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:44,034
I think I now understand
what that means.

573
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,823
Next morning on the river, and

574
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:02,059
of course we're not alone.

575
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,363
Fishermen from all the
surrounding villages have heard

576
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:08,098
of us, and have, long before

577
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,770
we're even awake, have
come by to check us out.

578
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,706
Can you find a couple onions?

579
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:16,907
Don't go crazy.

580
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,077
If we don't have them,
we don't have them.

581
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:22,146
I will not go crazy.

582
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:22,848
All right.

583
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:27,885
I about get on the
spam and egg patrol.

584
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:30,421
They may have had invented the

585
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:31,323
stealth bomber, maybe this will

586
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:38,162
be our crowning
accomplishment as

587
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,864
once we timely get there,

588
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,799
we're supposed to get
all the way back.

589
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,669
Coming back was never
part of the plan, man.

590
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,970
We're not coming back.

591
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,338
They will find us ten years

592
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,806
later naked in the bush with

593
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,309
like a necklace of spam cans.

594
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,746
That was glorious.

595
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:55,914
♪

596
00:36:55,915 --> 00:36:59,650
Time to get back
out on the river.

597
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:04,422
We have places to go.

598
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:08,092
Two days down the Congo.

599
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:13,298
We're finally nearing
our destination.

600
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:16,934
It's an abandoned Belgian
research station.

601
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:20,605
It's still functioning in some

602
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:24,909
capacity, but it goes about
30 kilometers in, over 250

603
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,176
buildings.

604
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:28,679
They are doing it all here.

605
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,319
Much myth and legend
surrounds this place.

606
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,486
Oh, there we go.

607
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:36,121
Yeah.

608
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:38,155
It has been inferred by some

609
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,658
that the Belgians conducted

610
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:43,828
uranium enrichment and a host of

611
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:48,833
bizarre experiments here.

612
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,101
However, the facts would suggest

613
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,704
the scariest thing to ever

614
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:57,675
happen here, some genetically

615
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:58,544
modified banana varieties.

616
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:03,281
We're in Gambi.

617
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,062
Deep in the jungle and miles

618
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,498
from anywhere, this was once the

619
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:25,470
institute for agricultural
studies of Congo.

620
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,805
Construction began in the 1930s.

621
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,307
The complex was once staffed by

622
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,644
hundreds of Belgian researchers,

623
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,980
doctors and engineers until they

624
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:43,421
left hurriedly in 1960.

625
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:46,524
With independence began
a rapid decline.

626
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:50,628
The eventual cessation
of funding.

627
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:52,530
Of the hundreds of structures

628
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:55,099
built here, what used to be

629
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,867
housing, laboratories, hospitals

630
00:38:56,868 --> 00:39:00,471
and research facilities, the
vast complex's library is

631
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:07,412
clearly the most important
to those who remain.

632
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:09,013
Though crumbling like everything

633
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:14,118
else, the grass is cut
and grounds maintained.

634
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,821
It swept and kept clean, and yet

635
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:21,526
most incredibly this man still

636
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:24,028
fights a daily battle to stave

637
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:27,264
off further decay to the
thousands of volumes of books

638
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:30,334
and research materials
contained on these shelves.

639
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:31,769
So what happened here?

640
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,903
Did the place stay open?

641
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:38,275
Did people continue
to do research?

642
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,111
There's some new stuff, but

643
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,780
for those who have been there

644
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:48,853
for long, they get an allowance
from the government.

645
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:49,721
Independence comes.

646
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:56,495
What happens here?

647
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:07,505
So unless I'm mistaken, the

648
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:08,673
gentleman just said cutting-edge

649
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:12,142
research moved to
Burundi and elsewhere.

650
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:16,013
The Congolese who remain, their

651
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,848
mission all these years later is

652
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:22,119
preserve the patrimony
that existed.

653
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,353
All this was state of the art

654
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:27,024
back in the '50s when
the library was built.

655
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:29,193
But for 20 years there hasn't

656
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:31,161
been electricity to run the

657
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,064
dehumid fires to
keep out the damp.

658
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,500
Through so many wars, through

659
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:36,634
all of these difficulties, he

660
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:40,505
has maintained this facility to

661
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:45,242
an extraordinary degree.

662
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:47,012
Why?

663
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:08,432
Staff still show
up to work and organize.

664
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,435
Catalog and write
requests for funding.

665
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,804
Perhaps to Kinshasa or a central

666
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:19,510
office where someone may
or may not ever respond.

667
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:22,279
He was here
pre-independence, yes?

668
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,450
Does he remember
the Belgian rule?

669
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:37,294
He remembers the period, and

670
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:39,897
that was the best time
they were living.

671
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:43,500
What do you say to someone
who suggests that ball Jan

672
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:51,501
colonialism might have
been the good times?

673
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,686
The road home.

674
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:05,723
Such as it is.

675
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:11,962
Rotting Bridges, makeshift
ferries, it's an adventure.

676
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:16,500
Fortunately ours was
a good adventure.

677
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:20,537
The Congo is a place that's
always fascinated me.

678
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,906
This is a trip I've been wanting

679
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:23,407
to take since I've been writing

680
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:26,043
stories or making television,

681
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,412
but what I found was
something unexpected.

682
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:30,781
I met a lot of people who for a

683
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:33,651
long time have been waiting.

684
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:38,255
Hoping for things to get better.

685
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:45,195
A lot more hope here than
there's any right to expect.

686
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,196
When all is said and done, I

687
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:49,167
wanted to go to the
Congo and I did.
