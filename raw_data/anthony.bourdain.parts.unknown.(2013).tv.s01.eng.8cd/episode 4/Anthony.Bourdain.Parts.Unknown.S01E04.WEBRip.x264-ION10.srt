♪

00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,523
It takes a special breed to

3
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,359
live in a province like Quebec.

4
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:40,360
It gets cold in winter,
and winters are long.

5
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,336
It takes a special kind of

6
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:46,206
person for whom frozen rivers,

7
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:49,008
icy, wind whipped streets, deep,

8
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,480
seemingly endless
forests are the norm.

9
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,516
I will confess my
partisanship up front.

10
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:57,517
I love Montreal.

11
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,719
It is my favorite
place in Canada.

12
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,324
The people who live there are

13
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:07,160
tough, crazy people and
I admire them for it.

14
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:10,330
Toronto, Vancouver, I love
you but not like Montreal.

15
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:10,664
Why?

16
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:12,365
I shall explain.

17
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,367
All will be revealed.

18
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:19,739
In the meantime,
check this guy out.

19
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,541
What is the post office motto?

20
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:25,245
Neither rain nor sleet nor
driving snow nor plague of

21
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:28,848
locusts prevent the mail carrier

22
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,016
from delivering junk mail?

23
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,418
Here in Montreal the simple task

24
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,085
of delivering the mail in winter

25
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:37,524
comes with its own
set of hurdles.

26
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,392
Icy hurdles.

27
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,360
I got to ask.

28
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:42,295
You have special
equipment for this?

29
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,796
We got to like slip on boots?

30
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:49,636
We do have boots when it gets
icy with spikes on them.

31
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,938
And they give us also slip on

32
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:56,576
spikes for when it's icy.

33
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,110
Any sort of city ordinance

34
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,314
that you have to shovel if...

35
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,815
Not penalized financially snnchs...

36
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:03,551
No, nothing like that.

37
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,386
Any injuries in
the line of duty?

38
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:10,089
I had several incidents.

39
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,157
I broke my ankle.

40
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,627
What is the most perilous
aspect of the job?

41
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,829
Dogs or icy stairs?

42
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,898
In this area there's a lot of

43
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:26,899
dogs but also icy stairs.

44
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,113
It's one thing have to work

45
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,415
outside in this wintry mess but

46
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,284
takes a strange and wonderful

47
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,818
kind of mutant to actually find

48
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,456
it pleasurable like, well,
these two gentlemen.

49
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:47,427
Do you like the cold?

50
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:50,530
I mean... it cleans
the streets of Ebola.

51
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,299
The cold.

52
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,532
The frigid cold keeps the

53
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:57,637
riff raff out of
the city for sure.

54
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:04,176
Fred and David, chefs at
the legendary Joe beef.

55
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,179
Historians of their beloved
great white north.

56
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,352
Princes of hospitality.

57
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,953
And what do men like this do for

58
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:18,725
fun when the rivers turn to ice?

59
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,827
When testicles shrink and most

60
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,363
of us scurry for
warmth and shelter?

61
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:24,497
If like so many other Canadians

62
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:27,400
they would go ice fishing on the St.
Lawrence fever.

63
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:31,338
The cabin fever in the family
because we are confined,

64
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,872
perhaps, to spend so much time

65
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:36,343
indoors a lot of the families

66
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:38,378
love to do activities together

67
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,613
like go to the cottage,
go ice fishing.

68
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,315
It's like get you
out of the house.

69
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,351
It's very much a family thing.

70
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,152
Like many of their ilk they'd

71
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:50,490
seek one of the temporary, small

72
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,225
towns of sled borne cabins,

73
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,894
drill a hole in the
ice, and wait.

74
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,529
But these are not normal men.

75
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,831
So is Quebec better than
the rest of Canada?

76
00:04:58,832 --> 00:04:59,767
Obviously.

77
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:00,501
Not bad.

78
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:01,601
Come on.

79
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,337
I mean, you didn't have
to think about that long.

80
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:04,605
No.

81
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:05,672
Wait a minute.

82
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,006
Are strippers paid hourly here?

83
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:11,277
Is that right?

84
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:14,213
It is considered an
art, a performance art.

85
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,248
So how does that work?

86
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,217
You don't tip a stripper?

87
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,386
You pay per song.

88
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:20,520
You pay per song.

89
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:26,192
Then you can get a
dance in the back.

90
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,394
Which is a private dance.

91
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:28,261
Ten bucks a song.

92
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,729
Five bucks a song in public.

93
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,265
That's why I go there because

94
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,267
their songs are super long
and I am a bit cheap.

95
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:41,874
I go for the lap dance.

96
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,643
After a suspiciously stunned

97
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:47,647
fish emerges from the
deep it is ignored.

98
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:54,454
Because Fred and Dave
do things differently.

99
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,589
No crude fried fish and
bread crumbs for these men.

100
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,425
Oh, wow.

101
00:05:57,426 --> 00:06:04,096
Look at that.

102
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,165
Instead a hearty lunch of French

103
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,400
classics accompanied by fine

104
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,169
wines and liquers as befitting

105
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,471
gentlemen of discerning taste

106
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,305
who have exhausted
themselves in the wild.

107
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,975
So this is how you live?

108
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,444
Well, more often than not, yes.

109
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:22,482
We always have to travel
well and eat properly.

110
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:23,950
White burgundy.

111
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:28,855
Glacier bay oysters as
well as thrown in there

112
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:29,189
delicious.

113
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,958
My prized possession.

114
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:39,632
The funnest part is the cutlery.

115
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,635
Fred has a wonderful
collection of table ware.

116
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,837
Without getting snobby or

117
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,973
elitist eating off vintage table

118
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,608
ware is one of the
great Joyce in life.

119
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,844
This is the interesting paradox.

120
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:55,147
You aspire to run a Democratic

121
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,383
establishment and yet you are

122
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,652
hopeless romantics when it

123
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:07,653
comes to painful nostalgics
the art of living, right?

124
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,064
Sustenance is required like say

125
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,568
a comsumme of ox tail to begin

126
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,537
followed by chilled lobster.

127
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:20,372
The art of dining is
disappearing much to our

128
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:20,674
chagrin.

129
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,642
I work super hard at being an

130
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:26,713
excellent dining companion.

131
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:27,914
When seeking excellence in a

132
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,216
dining companion what
qualities does one look for?

133
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,885
I turn my phone off, you know?

134
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,522
I never put my
elbows on the table.

135
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:36,223
Of course.

136
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,324
Come prepared with stories.

137
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,192
Don't drink too much.

138
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,028
Don't become sloppy.

139
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:42,663
Come prepared.

140
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,597
Absolutely.

141
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,064
No elbows on the table?

142
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,533
No.

143
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,434
It's not proper.

144
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:51,003
I am a total failure
as a dining companion.

145
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,872
What is that?

146
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,607
What's that, you ask?

147
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:59,846
An iconic classic of gastronomy?

148
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,413
Look at that sauce.

149
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:01,882
Holy crap.

150
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:04,517
The devilishly difficult dish.

151
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:09,421
A boneless, wild hare in a sauce

152
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,560
of its own blood, truffle,
garnished with thick slabs

153
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:18,598
seared directly on the top
of the cabin's wood stove.

154
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,567
Look at that.

155
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:26,072
We're in a wooden shack,
over three feet of ice.

156
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:30,943
You are hopeless romantics, gentlemen.

157
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:35,715
Oh, look at that.

158
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:43,716
The dish is perch atop
an etherial dish.

159
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,394
This is from the vineyard.

160
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:48,929
Nice.

161
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:49,262
Wonderful.

162
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,998
Yes, yes it is.

163
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,265
Really.

164
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,401
Is there a billionaire or despot

165
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,669
pot anywhere on earth who at

166
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,805
this precise moment is
eating better than us?

167
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,640
No.

168
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,641
No.

169
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,811
Look at that.

170
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:05,278
Cheese.

171
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,813
There must be cheese.

172
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:12,251
In this case a voluptuously

173
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,020
filled dish which some less

174
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,756
hearty outdoorsmen might
call over ripe but not us.

175
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,959
This is awesome.

176
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,260
Here.

177
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,094
A few Cubans.

178
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:24,697
You guys have a much more
relaxed attitude toward the

179
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:29,602
importation of Cuban cigars.

180
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,371
Chartreuse of course and a
dessert as rare as it gets.

181
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:37,276
A dinosaur era monster
long believed extinct.

182
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,346
This is ghetto... who does this?

183
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,981
No one fries it is one of

184
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,316
those, like, painful,
nostalgic things.

185
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:44,652
Right.

186
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:48,454
Layers of almond and hazelnut

187
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,722
meringue, chocolate
butter cream.

188
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,691
Look at that!

189
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,525
That was good.

190
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,629
For these guys, this is normal.

191
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,797
This is lunch.

192
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,666
Some days it's like play

193
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,467
house in my house,
French play house.

194
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:01,802
Yeah?

195
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:02,670
What do you do?

196
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:03,903
Get dressed at their house.

197
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:04,672
No way.

198
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:05,805
Tell me about it.

199
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:06,806
The kids, too.

200
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,374
He's a dandy.

201
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,342
A Sunday dandy.

202
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:17,343
Last time I did I made salad la

203
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,190
orange, and then a huge cheese

204
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,826
Kurd about like 15
kurds of cheese.

205
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:27,394
Right.

206
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:29,161
And how many people
are in your family?

207
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,830
Him and his wife and
two young boys.

208
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:31,531
Right.

209
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:32,765
How many kids?

210
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:36,035
So you, your wife, and a
2-year-old and a 4-year-old.

211
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:39,839
They don't make it to the end

212
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,043
usually until
prematurely opened.

213
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,879
I'm thinking that's... I'm also

214
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,947
thinking I have to do that.

215
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:55,948
Actually my daughter would
totally be into it.

216
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,706
Once every so often a
nation will produce a hero.

217
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:14,941
Someone who changes everything

218
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,744
about their chosen field, who

219
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:19,779
changes the whole landscape,

220
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:26,385
life after them is
never the same.

221
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,788
This is such a man.

222
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,991
A here to foreunencountered

223
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,425
rugged outdoorsman, veteran chef

224
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,928
with many years of fine
dining experience.

225
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,897
Renegade, innovator, one of the

226
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:41,400
most influential chefs
in north America.

227
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:45,772
He is also a proud Quebec wa and

228
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:46,740
perhaps he more than anyone else

229
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,574
is define for a new generation

230
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,811
of Americans and Canadians
what that means.

231
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:55,782
He is an unlikely ambassador for

232
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:58,317
his country and his province but

233
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,618
maybe not so unlikely.

234
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,788
I mean, look at him.

235
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:02,789
Out for a day trapping beaver

236
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:09,929
with a local trapper, Carl.

237
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,330
So the bait is wood?

238
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:11,965
Yeah.

239
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:12,699
Just the bark.

240
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:13,533
They eat the bark.

241
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:15,201
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,669
In pioneer days beaver was

243
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,605
the financial engine of Canada.

244
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:19,973
Yeah.

245
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:22,842
Empires were built on it.

246
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:23,976
Every hat practically in the

247
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,511
world was made of a bever pelt.

248
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:32,819
That's why today it is
the icon of Canada.

249
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,788
To a lesser extent the
tradition continues today.

250
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,156
Carl continues to trap usually

251
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,657
called on by provision officials

252
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,860
to track beaver and clear away

253
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,061
dams and control what could

254
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:47,666
become a destructively
overpopulated situation.

255
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,501
Hello, my little friend.

256
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,470
This is a young one.

257
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,239
Those are the one
we want to eat.

258
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,207
What will you compare
the meat to?

259
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,909
Is there anything like it?

260
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,845
That's the thing.

261
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:58,978
There is nothing.

262
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:06,979
Nothing like it. When you
eat beaver it's beaver.

263
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:13,225
Along with an encyclopedia
knowledge of fine wines and

264
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,027
attachment to the music of

265
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,362
Celine Dion he is a big believer

266
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:19,231
in honoring history
and tradition.

267
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,499
If you still trap beavers you

268
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,669
should if at all possible
cook them and eat them.

269
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,606
Not just strip them
of their pellets.

270
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,675
As incredible as it might seem

271
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:33,745
you can cook beaver
really, really well.

272
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,047
Beaver tail on the other hand is

273
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,716
not actually beaver at all.

274
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,052
Rather, a quick spoon bread type

275
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,687
of thing that in our case goes

276
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:49,688
somewhat awry during an
inadvertent inferno.

277
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,934
The sauce almost looks like

278
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,135
chocolate it is so rich looking.

279
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:56,937
I love it.

280
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:57,905
When it is like that.

281
00:13:57,906 --> 00:13:59,138
Some people don't put too much

282
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:04,110
blood but I like when
it is very thick.

283
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:04,444
Wow.

284
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,112
Absolutely delicious.

285
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:05,745
It is.

286
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:10,216
I wasn't joking about it.

287
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,318
It doesn't taste
like chicken at all.

288
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:18,124
This is your first time.

289
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:18,325
Wow.

290
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,326
Something I think you
almost eat everything.

291
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:20,961
Yeah.

292
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:22,561
At this point, you know, animals

293
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:28,434
see me and they're like, ah.

294
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,768
That guy.

295
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,003
There is a joke around here

296
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,138
somewhere but to tell you the

297
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:40,139
truth the stuff
is just too good.

298
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:47,119
It's like ten below zero
in this freaking town.

299
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,158
That generally does not
spell good times for me.

300
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,993
A good time for me is more like

301
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:57,930
a palm tree, a beach, a swimming

302
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:05,931
pool, but the only
cold thing is my beer.

303
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:06,873
But no.

304
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,607
They like to frolic
in the snow and ice.

305
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,310
More accurately, they like to

306
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:14,613
obey their genetic imperative to

307
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:19,185
risk dental and facial injury by

308
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,552
skating around slapping at a

309
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,521
hard disk trying to drive it in

310
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,057
each other's general direction.

311
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:30,696
I believe they call
this sport hockey.

312
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:34,033
This is not in my blood.

313
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:34,567
You skate?

314
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:36,668
We grew up on this.

315
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,669
Everyone in Quebec?

316
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,371
What else?

317
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:41,573
There is no reason to live
here if there is no hockey.

318
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:45,411
Hockey rinks pop up all over
the city to accommodate

319
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,480
Montrealers' desire to risk
teeth, groin, and limb.

320
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,682
Right behind Fred and Dave's

321
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,686
restaurant Joe beef a pickup
game of chefs, cooks, and

322
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,222
hospitality professionals
is under way.

323
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:59,658
Some of these guys have looked

324
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,892
to be a little long in the tooth

325
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,329
to be out there swinging sticks

326
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,164
at each other skidding
around on the ice.

327
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,398
This is normal behavior?

328
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,234
People actual dye this?

329
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,201
Absolutely.

330
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:10,769
This is every day growing
up playing hockey.

331
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,004
Canadian national sport, man.

332
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,674
This young one is already
being indoctrinated.

333
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:16,176
Hello, young man.

334
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:18,344
You going to play hockey?

335
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,013
Are you going to be a
goalie or a player?

336
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:21,781
A player.

337
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:22,182
Wow.

338
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:24,783
A player.

339
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:25,917
Oh, man.

340
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,419
Am I going to get like a mouth

341
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,191
full of puck by the way?

342
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,193
It's being catered with Fred

343
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:38,530
and Dave's usual restraint.

344
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,032
Come eat.

345
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:44,603
Hot coco in Styrofoam cups?

346
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,938
No.

347
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,808
Try a Titanic containing

348
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,211
flintstone sized hunks of pork

349
00:16:52,212 --> 00:17:00,212
belly, bacon, home made
portions, smoked chops, plus

350
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,420
veal and pork links.

351
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:02,788
Oh, yeah.

352
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:07,093
This is a truly heroic dish.

353
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:10,229
Look at the beautiful work.

354
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,264
Awesome.

355
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,333
This is the single best argument

356
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,736
for sharing a border
with Germany.

357
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:22,441
And of course the finest
wines known to humanity.

358
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:28,314
German wine, pirate bottles.

359
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:28,581
Sweet.

360
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,982
What am I drinking?

361
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:31,684
Canadian.

362
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,919
This is Norman Hardy from prince

363
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,655
Edward county five
hours from here.

364
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:37,290
Amazing wine.

365
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,259
Here's an allegory
here somewhere.

366
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,628
I'm reaching for it.

367
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,029
Something about friend days,

368
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,432
reckless abandon coupled with
precision and technique.

369
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,799
A hockey metaphor perhaps.

370
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,135
The hell with it.

371
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:52,171
Look.

372
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,107
Sausages.

373
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,727
Montreal to Quebec city by rail.

374
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:23,728
160 miles of wintry vistas
whipped past the windows,

375
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,572
evocative for some
of another time.

376
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,241
Sturgeon and caviar.

377
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:33,245
I'm not sure about Dave
McMillan but in Fred's perfect

378
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:36,248
world we would all
travel by rail.

379
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,984
It would still be the
golden age of rail travel.

380
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,320
So tell me about the great
Canadian rail system.

381
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,754
It's purely emotional.

382
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,690
Really?

383
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:44,923
Nothing rational about it.

384
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:50,362
Fred is what one might call
conservatively an expert.

385
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,664
How extreme is your
railroad nerdism?

386
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,433
This is how bad it gets.

387
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,202
Operating manual.

388
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:56,203
This model train.

389
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:56,736
Yeah.

390
00:18:56,737 --> 00:19:00,839
So you have other operations.

391
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,708
Yeah.

392
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:05,777
Books, printed
information, collectibles.

393
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,346
An enduring love for the great

394
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,614
iron horses that still take

395
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:12,050
passengers across the
frozen land he calls home.

396
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,120
But it is something more
than just nostalgia.

397
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,690
It's also an appreciation
for a dying art.

398
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,527
It's like the old cruise ships.

399
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:25,264
You transport your comfort.

400
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,200
You know?

401
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,770
For those days of cross country
rail there were lavish

402
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,039
dining cars, luxurious sleeping

403
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,276
compartments, a bar
car with attendants.

404
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,311
We look at the menus of how

405
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,546
people would eat on trains.

406
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,914
It was inspiration of how
we cook in the restaurant.

407
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,452
All the sweet breads and
fresh peas, leg of lamb.

408
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,287
Current jelly.

409
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:49,455
Very nice pictures in the
dining by train book.

410
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,657
The guy holding the Turkey
and cutting the Turkey.

411
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:52,124
Right.

412
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,092
You order a drink.

413
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:54,326
It comes from a bottle made out

414
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:57,229
of glass into a glass
made out of glass right.

415
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,398
Which is kind of cool
in our day and age.

416
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,668
It goes back to
service doesn't it?

417
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:03,135
Thank you.

418
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:06,305
We are presented with a
perfectly serviceable omlete.

419
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:09,074
There may no longer be a smoking

420
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,443
lounge with brass spitoons but

421
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,812
this does not mean a
traveler has to suffer.

422
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,081
You always travel
with a truffle?

423
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,017
As a gentleman must.

424
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:19,419
Wait a minute.

425
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,187
I got to get an action
photograph here.

426
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:22,622
Canadian rail.

427
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:25,090
All these people are going to be

428
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,658
expecting... wait a minute.

429
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,659
Where is my truffle?

430
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,696
Can I have the truffle
option please?

431
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,365
Oh, of course.

432
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:41,340
Don't forget the flop.

433
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,208
Quebec city.

434
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,142
One of the oldest European

435
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:52,143
settlements in north America.

436
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,521
Samuel Dechanplain sailed up the

437
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:57,889
Saint Lurns and founded
the site in 1608.

438
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,358
When the fighting started with

439
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,159
you know who Quebec city was the

440
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,328
French stronghold until the

441
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,496
bitter end when the French fell

442
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:12,497
at the plains of Abraham.

443
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,542
The French may have lost that

444
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:22,381
one but some things French
have stayed firm, unbowed,

445
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:26,518
resiliently unchanged
by trends or history.

446
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,255
The continental is the kind
of place about which I am

447
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:33,492
unreservedly sentimental.

448
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,394
When I was younger I ate here

449
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,195
with my grandparents
and parents.

450
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:39,531
The best restaurant in town.

451
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,368
Classic.

452
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:45,103
Unironic cuisine, meaning dishes

453
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:50,742
you haven't seen
since, like, forever.

454
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:55,581
Fresh, continental, ocean liner

455
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:57,416
classics such as... Ceasar

456
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,950
salad, tossed fresh to order.

457
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,386
Table side.

458
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,588
And beef char char also prepared

459
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:08,527
table side as one must.

460
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,362
Shrimp cocktail.

461
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:14,065
A shrimp cocktail the way
Jesus wants you to eat them.

462
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:19,037
All served by a
dedicated professional.

463
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,039
In culinary school
we were taught this.

464
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,208
Real customers is
your final class.

465
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:26,211
We'd have to do the fruits,

466
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:26,979
table side, all that which would

467
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,747
fly off the fork and
land in somebody's soup.

468
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:29,416
I was so bad.

469
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:30,449
Start with the orange.

470
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,550
Run into trouble.

471
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:34,052
I'll be right back.

472
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,587
Bite with my teeth.

473
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:36,456
Stripping the thing.

474
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:38,156
At least once a day.

475
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,591
One of the students would set

476
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:44,095
themselves or the
customers on fire.

477
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,398
The inferno would spill
and they'd light it.

478
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,266
There would be this line from

479
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:50,736
the thing down across
the floor up their leg.

480
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:50,937
No.

481
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,137
That doesn't happen here.

482
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:53,939
Like I said, professionals.

483
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,975
This is going to go
like a big fire ball.

484
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,009
Fire ball.

485
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,277
Good.

486
00:22:58,278 --> 00:22:59,478
The kind who know how to

487
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:06,117
properly prepare these dishes.

488
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:06,453
Sweet.

489
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:08,520
Like a goose bump moment.

490
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:08,788
Yeah.

491
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:13,759
For Dave, another classic.

492
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,262
A sauce made of cognac, cream.

493
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:17,964
That is nice.

494
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:20,265
Look at that.

495
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:28,266
And for Fred, scampi Newberg.

496
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:29,476
Awesome.

497
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:30,276
Absolutely awesome.

498
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:34,546
For me, that most noble
of dishes, Dover sole.

499
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,381
This appears to be one of the

500
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,649
few remaining servers alive who

501
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,984
knows how to take that fish off

502
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:46,124
the bone, sauce it, and
properly serve it.

503
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:50,128
Thank you very much.

504
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,130
So happy.

505
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,566
Very comforting.

506
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:59,905
There is continuity
in this world.

507
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:07,906
Across town, another
thing entirely.

508
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:20,652
The younger, wilder
affaire cech ocech

509
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:33,264
cech ketchup which
means everything is cool.

510
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:37,543
Are they hipsters or am I just

511
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:40,178
crazy and thinks anybody
below 30 is a hipster?

512
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,748
I don't know but I admire them.

513
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:44,850
So how much did it cost
you when you opened?

514
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:45,718
Not much.

515
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:49,755
Look at this tiny electric
four burner stove.

516
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,056
At no point in my cooking career

517
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:52,924
could I have worked with one of

518
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:53,693
these without murdering everyone

519
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:55,293
in the vicinity before hanging

520
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:59,798
myself from the nearest beam.

521
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,800
How long did it take to adapt.

522
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,234
I would say three months.

523
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,036
In the beginning I was lucky I

524
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,138
didn't have a lot of guests.

525
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,608
I was like oh, man.

526
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,810
I was freaking out.

527
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,244
And yet these kids today.

528
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,279
Look at them go.

529
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,915
Serving a wild Liam Bishs and

530
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,084
quite substantial ever changing

531
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:22,788
menu out of this, this
Suzy home maker oven.

532
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:27,659
Tonight there's razor clams
and a cream of haddock.

533
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,729
Very cool.

534
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,097
Thank you.

535
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:34,766
I love clams.

536
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,968
And you'll notice that nobody in

537
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:41,006
Quebec seems to
skimp on portions.

538
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,509
Head cheese with mustard.

539
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,745
Oh, and truffled sweet breads.

540
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:53,819
And some goose hearts
for good measure.

541
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,153
Excellent.

542
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,121
Hearts in general.

543
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:59,157
Also you got your
grilled tomato bread.

544
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:05,864
That's salt cod for you Anglos.

545
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:08,767
I'm all swollen up like the tire

546
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,904
dude and ready to burst
on the directional mist.

547
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,642
Hotel/motel time for me.

548
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:34,660
How Canadian is Quebec?

549
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:36,828
Are they truly one
entity or two?

550
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,664
This is a question that has been

551
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:43,835
wrestled with for sometime.

552
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:46,004
Question Quebec
is certainly part

553
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:49,875
of Canada but in many ways
another thing entirely.

554
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:52,744
There is a lot of history
much of it contentious.

555
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:54,579
Go back far enough, and you get

556
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,750
a clearer picture of why.

557
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,085
The French arrived on the shores

558
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:04,055
of Quebec city in the early 16th

559
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,523
century and seccumbed to the

560
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,492
military might of Great
Britain in the mid 18th.

561
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,761
Thus began a gradual but steady

562
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:12,864
persecution of all
things French.

563
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,700
The Quebecwa have struggled

564
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:16,034
mightily to hang on to their

565
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,502
French heritage and language.

566
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:19,537
The issue of seceding entirely a

567
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:25,110
notion that persists to
some extent even today.

568
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:26,745
Journalist Patrick la gas meets

569
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:27,946
me for lunch to help me

570
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:30,081
understand a little bit of what

571
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:34,052
many Quebecwa feel is at stake.

572
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:38,356
I was going to talk about the
whole history, identity,

573
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,291
separatist movement but I have

574
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:45,764
to get right to the
pressing matter of the day.

575
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:46,132
Pastagate.

576
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:47,532
What do you want to know?

577
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:51,803
For those not up on current
Quebec politics, pastagate

578
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,705
refers to an incident where

579
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,306
local authorities notified an

580
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,743
Italian restaurant they were in

581
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,377
violation of French laws because

582
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:03,749
they used the word pasta
which is Italian.

583
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,450
Okay.

584
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:05,817
Stop apologizing.

585
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:06,118
Okay?

586
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,954
Don't get me wrong.

587
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:11,890
I lean French, hard.

588
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:16,427
I am enormously sympathetic
to the language laws.

589
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,596
You don't think it
is preposterous?

590
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,967
I do not but here we
have a situation.

591
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:23,434
It is stupid.

592
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,137
I agree with you completely

593
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,106
that this province 40 years ago

594
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,175
was in some respects
an English city.

595
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:33,578
We needed to have language
laws for signage and stuff.

596
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,814
Now, signage for instance

597
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:39,851
must by law be
principally in French.

598
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,787
French first in all things.

599
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,688
But every bureaucracy produces

600
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:44,790
by products of stupidity.

601
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:45,591
That was it.

602
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,358
You know what?

603
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,859
It will not stand.

604
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,328
The Anglo Canadian treated

605
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,998
French speaking Quebec law like

606
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,532
second class crap for
much of history.

607
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,533
I get it.

608
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:56,968
I'd want my own thing and when I

609
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,269
got it I'd want to make sure

610
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:04,009
there is no back sliding
to the bad old days.

611
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,877
The first sovereign to be

612
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:08,947
elected in 1976, it didn't
come out of a vacuum.

613
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:14,352
It came out from a couple
decades of awakening and

614
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:14,686
struggle.

615
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,321
50 years from now will people

616
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,556
still be speaking predominantly
French in Montreal?

617
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,025
Yes.

618
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:19,959
No doubt about it.

619
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,560
French first is something
most would agree with.

620
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,963
How far and how vigorously you

621
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:30,869
want to go with that, well,
do you think there is any

622
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,073
possibility or real majority

623
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:37,843
plurality who would have voted

624
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:44,816
in separate nation status?

625
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:47,986
In English you guys say
timing is everything.

626
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:51,656
The timing was never
better than in 1991, 1992.

627
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:52,891
From 1995 this country came

628
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,392
inches from being broken up.

629
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,861
Do you think it will happen

630
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,929
in the history of the world?

631
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,930
I don't know.

632
00:29:58,931 --> 00:29:59,931
But I know one thing.

633
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,900
Anybody who says separatism is

634
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,902
dead in this country and
this province is a fool.

635
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:07,205
No matter how you feel about

636
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:08,739
Quebec, either separate from or

637
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,842
as essential part of greater

638
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,344
Canada, any reasonable
person loves this place.

639
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:17,082
Correct me if I'm wrong.

640
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,350
This is famous for the
sandwich special.

641
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:22,720
What tradition
does this fall in?

642
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:23,754
Basically eastern Europe.

643
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:24,956
It was a survival thing.

644
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,124
It was because they were poor.

645
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,928
And that's what they could make.

646
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,931
Wilensky's an old school

647
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:35,800
corner institution around since

648
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,468
1932 serving up pressed meat,

649
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,470
bologna, and salami sandwiches

650
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,939
or specials as they call them

651
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,410
with egg Greens and milk shakes.

652
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:50,081
So the special and an
appropriate beverage.

653
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,416
Very happy.

654
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,718
Here's how it goes.

655
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:57,088
There are rules.

656
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:00,058
The special is always
served with mustard.

657
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,659
It is never cut in two.

658
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,261
Don't ask why.

659
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:04,130
Just because.

660
00:31:04,131 --> 00:31:07,632
That's the way it's
always been done.

661
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:10,268
A little respect for
tradition, please.

662
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,003
Hum.

663
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:14,605
I'm happy now.

664
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,407
Some things are beloved
institutions for a reason.

665
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:20,145
This is delicious.

666
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:23,549
Thank you.

667
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:36,761
The tradition of the sugar

668
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,696
shack is as old as maple syrup

669
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,332
here in Quebec where 70% of the

670
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,269
world's supply comes from.

671
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:48,206
Deeply embedded in the maple
syrup outdoor lumber Jack

672
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,374
lifestyle is the cabin in the

673
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:53,711
woods where maple sap is
collected and boiled down to

674
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:54,113
syrup.

675
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:57,448
Over time, many of these cabins

676
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,017
became informal eating houses,

677
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:01,386
dining halls for workers and a

678
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:03,154
few guests where a lucky few

679
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,489
could sit at communal tables and

680
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:12,363
enjoy the bounty of the trees
and forests around them.

681
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,499
This tradition has been taken to

682
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,734
what is somehow both its logical

683
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:19,804
conclusion and insane extreme.

684
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:23,174
Creating his own shack open only

685
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,176
during maple season and serving

686
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,644
food stemming directly from

687
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:29,714
those humble yet hearty roots.

688
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:32,050
It makes perfect
sense in one way.

689
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:35,153
I mean, 130 acres produced about

690
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,754
32,000 gallons of maple sap,

691
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,923
which run through these tubes

692
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,225
here where they're cooked down

693
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:42,527
to about 800 gallons of syrup,

694
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:46,031
which is more or less what
they use per season here.

695
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:50,001
Nothing leaves the property.

696
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,269
And it makes sense while you're

697
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,071
here to raise hogs and cattle on

698
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:55,240
the property and maybe keep a

699
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:56,407
cabin or two around for any

700
00:32:56,408 --> 00:33:02,247
friends who get too
loaded to sleep it off.

701
00:33:02,248 --> 00:33:05,216
But this?

702
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:12,890
This is there really
any reason for this?

703
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:13,924
What are you doing here?

704
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,894
Why do you have to
make life so hard?

705
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,596
If money were your primary

706
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:19,964
motivation, this doesn't seem

707
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:24,135
like the fastest road
to untold wealth.

708
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:28,906
You know, everybody had a
you can go back three

709
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,475
generations and they
had a sugar shack.

710
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:33,144
I am very proud of Quebec.

711
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:34,379
I'm very proud of Canada.

712
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,281
You know?

713
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:37,282
You celebrate Canadian history.

714
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:39,950
You celebrate
cannadian traditions.

715
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,219
You celebrate Canadian

716
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,221
ingredients in a way
that no one else has.

717
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:44,955
Are you some kind of patriot?

718
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:49,060
Is that what's going on here?

719
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,628
Is it national...
Very much a patriot.

720
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,297
I say it all the time.

721
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:54,232
This is one of most important

722
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:57,668
restaurants to me in north
America if not the world.

723
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:04,442
An art installation if
you actually look at it.

724
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:11,182
The meal begins with a
power of maple desserts.

725
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,250
Good lord.

726
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:14,485
Sponge maple toffee, maple

727
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:17,255
donuts, beaver tails,
maple cotton candy.

728
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:17,756
But wait.

729
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:19,324
There's more.

730
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:22,327
Almond croissant,
whipped biscuits.

731
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:23,095
Some nugget.

732
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:23,329
Yeah.

733
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,029
Ah.

734
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:24,663
There we go.

735
00:34:24,664 --> 00:34:26,331
I think that is a first for me.

736
00:34:26,332 --> 00:34:27,865
I've never seen that done.

737
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:33,171
Not with a hammer.

738
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:37,007
Then let the madness begin.

739
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,276
Next, a whole lobe of baked

740
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:42,180
beans on a pan cake cooked
in duck fat of course.

741
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:45,216
Cottage cheese and eggs
cooked in maple sirup.

742
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:45,784
Wow.

743
00:34:45,785 --> 00:34:47,017
That's awesome.

744
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,954
There's a healthy salad.

745
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,489
Sauteed duck hearts, gizzards

746
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,358
and pig's ear topped with a

747
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,560
heaping pile of
fried pork rinds.

748
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:58,196
Good lord.

749
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:01,566
Oh, and a calf brain and
maple bacon omlete.

750
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,168
And these.

751
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:03,301
How this is made?

752
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:04,069
With love.

753
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,336
With love.

754
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:09,006
Panko-encrusted duck drum

755
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:10,708
sticks with shrimp and salmon

756
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,377
moose and maple barbecue sauce.

757
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:13,644
Good lord.

758
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:13,845
Wow.

759
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:18,649
This is a classic dish.

760
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,921
It is a meat pie.

761
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:29,227
Calf brain, sweet breads,

762
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:31,262
bacon, and with Martin
that is not sufficient.

763
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:33,264
Usually there is no
truffle but I just...

764
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,333
Yes, black truffles.

765
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,601
More truffle.

766
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,870
Too much truffle.

767
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,041
My blood is getting thicker
as I look at that.

768
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,676
Now the main course, a home

769
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,111
grown smoked right out front

770
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:49,347
local ham, with pineapple
and green beans almandine.

771
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:50,848
And with chicken, but with

772
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:57,622
Martin, chicken is
never just chicken.

773
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,257
Stuffed with foie
gras and lobster.

774
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:01,426
We pump lobster bisque
into the chicken.

775
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,127
Good god.

776
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:11,128
There is a light at the
end of the tunnel.

777
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:16,241
Oh.

778
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:17,275
Someone should be singing the

779
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:20,411
national anthem now,
I mean, really.

780
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:24,415
In practically prehistoric

781
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,150
old-schooled Canadian classic,

782
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:26,484
maple syrup is heated, then

783
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:31,155
poured on snow, making a kind of

784
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,790
Taffy, but the preferred

785
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:38,829
delivery mechanism does
present some issues.

786
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,097
No, no, no, no, no.

787
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:40,632
What?

788
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,967
Take a big one, and
you have to suck it.

789
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:47,438
Don't swallow it, you know?

790
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:49,940
Look, you have to go like
that, slowly, slowly.

791
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,009
You know?

792
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,945
Just slowly, slowly.

793
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,348
That's how it's good.

794
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,250
That's it.

795
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,086
Can I do that in a manly way?

796
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,688
You just sort of look
away in a distracted way.

797
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:11,689
I'm not really... the
best way is to look up.

798
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,635
Finally maple meringue cake
and maple ice cream with

799
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:22,707
chocolate shards.

800
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,442
Any suggestion on
how to attack it.

801
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:25,510
We did it once.

802
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:32,483
I went the chef suggests a cone

803
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:35,720
and the chef suggests
you eat it like that.

804
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:36,388
There's the thing.

805
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:37,356
I think there's too much

806
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:44,495
focusing on the food, wow, these

807
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:45,530
are very intellectual and wow.

808
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:46,731
I've done too much of
all those... you know?

809
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:47,399
I don't want to do that.

810
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,338
I don't want to play
games any more.

811
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:57,909
Because food is
feces in waiting.

812
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,710
This is CNN.

813
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,423
If there's one thing you
always need on a cold snowy

814
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:15,326
night, it's yet
another hearty meal.

815
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:21,165
I meet back up with Dave and the

816
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,867
Liverpool house, sister
restaurant to Joe beef.

817
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:24,435
I think we always compensate

818
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:27,572
a little bit with
overabundance of food.

819
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:29,507
Because of our insecurity of not

820
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:31,376
being, like, good cooks.

821
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:33,778
You know what?

822
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,513
It's a combination of low

823
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,947
self-esteem and generosity that

824
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,717
explains the amount
of food, perhaps.

825
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:45,723
First course... gravlax of char.

826
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:49,527
Salman gundi.

827
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:50,396
Beets and eggs.

828
00:38:50,397 --> 00:38:51,397
Look at that.

829
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:53,130
Unbelievable.

830
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:57,201
Look at the aspic work.

831
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,504
This is smoked potatoes inside.

832
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:01,472
Salmon pastrami.

833
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,073
Wait a minute.

834
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:09,580
This is super classic.

835
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,450
Soft, boiled or poached egg

836
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:15,620
in clear gelatin broth classly

837
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:19,056
garnished with white ham,
tarragon leaves and black

838
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:19,591
truffles.

839
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:20,392
Oh, my god, I was pretty sure

840
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:21,159
I would live the rest of my life

841
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:21,960
without ever seeing this again.

842
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:24,161
Delicious.

843
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:27,632
But tonight after a full week of

844
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:33,604
Franco-Canadian full-on assaults

845
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:36,941
on our livers and our lights,

846
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:39,444
Fred and Dave thought it would

847
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:42,913
be good to take advantage of the

848
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,015
insanely delicious fare by their

849
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:46,951
brilliant chef Omar,
who's from Pakistan.

850
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:48,453
Amazing, authentic
Pakistani food.

851
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:51,822
What do we have here?

852
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:58,429
Butter chicken crab, tikka,
pomegrana pomegranate.

853
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,697
A little mushrooms.

854
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:02,833
Rabbit korma.

855
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:09,139
Fingerlings with a
fenugreek and fennel.

856
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,208
This is donkey hanarri.

857
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:14,011
Yes, he did say donkey.

858
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:14,546
The dishes continue.

859
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:15,313
Pakistani gumbo with okra and

860
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:18,483
coriander, a says my seed
and green pepper curry.

861
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:23,320
Hangar steak, scotch egg, and an

862
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,190
authentic goat biryani.

863
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:26,658
Wow.

864
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,459
Biryani's awesome.

865
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:28,894
Are you full?

866
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:29,828
Yeah.

867
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:31,361
Pretty close.

868
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:35,032
We did good work here.

869
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,702
In the end, and perhaps as a nod

870
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:42,206
to the Anglo tradition,
however, there will be stilt.

871
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:46,677
This is a genius meal.

872
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:51,482
These princes of gastronomy,

873
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:53,217
never a suboptimal moment.

874
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:58,889
Nothing short of
excellent accepted.

875
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,924
Beyond excellent.

876
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:00,859
Too much excellent?

877
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:01,226
Yes.

878
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:01,560
Possibly.

879
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:01,993
Over the top?

880
00:41:01,994 --> 00:41:03,260
Yeah, definitely.

881
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:04,062
It all comes around in the end.

882
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:05,996
The circle of life.

883
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,833
We begin at the beginning, the

884
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:15,272
heart and soul of every
right-thinking Quebecois,

885
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:15,674
apparently.

886
00:41:15,675 --> 00:41:18,776
Ice, a stick, and a puck.

887
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:20,210
Fred and Dave and Martin Picard

888
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,912
are joined by the original god

889
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,848
of Montreal gastronomy, the

890
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:27,518
great chef Norman la Pris to

891
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,723
watch their beloved Montreal

892
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,560
Canadians lay waste to
the Carolina hurricanes.

893
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:36,694
All the while eating, of course,

894
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:39,396
and drinking, as it turns out,

895
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:44,635
the finest wines
known to humanity.

896
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,871
And here we go.

897
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:49,775
Oh!
