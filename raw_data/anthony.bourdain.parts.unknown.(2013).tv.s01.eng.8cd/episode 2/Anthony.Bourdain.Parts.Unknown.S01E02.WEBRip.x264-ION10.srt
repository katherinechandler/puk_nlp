1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,372
For Korean-Americans,
according to the stereotype

2
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:06,373
anyway, it used to be that you

3
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:10,543
grew up to be a doctor,
a lawyer, an engineer.

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,347
There were a specific set
of rules and expectations.

5
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,982
Are you asking me
to be in a porno?

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,384
Is that what you're asking me?

7
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:20,120
Thanks to some remarkably
bad Koreans, though,

8
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,222
things are beginning to change.

9
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,923
I went to one year of law
school and I walked out.

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:24,892
So you're a bad Korean.

11
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:25,793
Yeah, I'm a bad Korean.

12
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:26,826
Any final advice for somebody

13
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,928
who's actually about to
marry a Korean woman?

14
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,398
Don't do it.

15
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:41,067
♪ ♪

16
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:21,281
All I knew was that this
town was going down,

17
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,116
and no one was showing up.

18
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,317
And so we as Koreans

19
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,985
figured that out really quickly.

20
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,019
There's a point where you and I

21
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,020
look at each other and say.

22
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,689
They're not coming.

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,123
They're not coming, Tony.

24
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:31,191
You know? Like, it's you and me.

25
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,225
Right. Right. The choppers

26
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,194
will not be here anytime soon.

27
00:01:33,195 --> 00:01:35,962
You know? Yeah, I mean,
so that's when all the

28
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,397
stuff started to go down.

29
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:40,633
Roy Choi is a second-generation
Korean American.

30
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,169
He lives in Los Angeles.

31
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,870
He's the owner/operator of

32
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,472
four groundbreaking and much

33
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,540
loved food trucks, among the

34
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,309
first to harness the strange

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,877
and terrible powers of social

36
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,679
media to alert customers to

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,516
where to find delicious food.

38
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,851
This was the command post.

39
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,320
From here, you know, you could

40
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:03,156
look, and you could see
if fires were going on.

41
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:06,226
When the Los Angeles
riots happened in 1992,

42
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,060
Roy was 22 years old.

43
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,696
And this plaza's rooftop played

44
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:12,999
a central role for Koreans
defending their town.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,468
But let's back up a bit.

46
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:16,836
After the Immigration Act of

47
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:21,674
1965, thousands of Koreansof
began arriving in L.A.

48
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,043
The first to arrive were
mostly middle-class,

49
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,913
college-educated, hoping
to make a lateral move

50
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,881
into American society.

51
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,351
But unless you had a medical
or engineering degree,

52
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,786
that turned out to be tough.

53
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,023
They found work as
merchants, store owners,

54
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,193
opened liquor stores,
groceries, massage studios,

55
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:41,361
dry cleaners.

56
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:44,464
They did that in an area
that was, as it's called,

57
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:45,965
underserved.

58
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,301
Where major chains
feared to tread, where

59
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:52,872
others preferred to
abandon, Koreans moved in.

60
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,107
So, 1992.

61
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,545
Four L.A. police officers

62
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,313
are on trial for what sure as

63
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,482
hell looked to me like a wildly

64
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,417
excessive and prolonged beating

65
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,119
of an unarmed Rodney King.

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,056
In April of that year,
they were acquitted.

67
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,724
For me, it was a, "Holy shit, I

68
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,593
never saw that coming" moment. I

69
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:14,394
For African Americans, it

70
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,229
was a somewhat ruder surprise.

71
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,232
To say people were angry
would be an understatement.

72
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:22,335
They don't represent
the people no more.

73
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,570
South Central is that way.

74
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,637
So, you could almost feel it

75
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,406
like a tidal wave coming.

76
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:27,940
The L.A.P.D. were completely

77
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,977
unprepared for what
happened next.

78
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,979
Everything you see right
here, all this, was being

79
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,281
looted.

80
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,449
Chairs and rocks and everything

81
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,917
being thrown through walls.

82
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,086
If you go straight down
Western, on Venice,

83
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,021
the whole plaza burned on fire.

84
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:46,326
We were calling 911 and
there was no response.

85
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,594
Did cops come at all?

86
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,262
I was here all three days.

87
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,763
I didn't see any cops.

88
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,765
Well, where did they set
up their front line?

89
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,133
Rodeo Drive.

90
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:56,669
Where did the forces of law
and order set up their

91
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,505
perimeter?

92
00:03:57,506 --> 00:03:59,038
Not here.

93
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,109
Koreatown was left
to its own devices.

94
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,143
The official borders are

95
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,712
Third Street on the north end,

96
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,447
Olympic Boulevard to the south,

97
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,181
Vermont Avenue on the east,

98
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,451
and Western Avenue to the west.

99
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:15,121
That's three square miles
left pretty much to burn

100
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,358
or fend for itself.

101
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,628
This rooftop quickly became
the command post for

102
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,965
rapidly improvised
Korean defense forces.

103
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,668
They armed themselves, set
up crude but effective

104
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,472
command and control
communication, and patrols.

105
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:33,540
We weren't going around just

106
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,342
slugging and-and capping people.

107
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:36,343
All that was happening was,

108
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:39,479
"Just don't break
down my store."

109
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,815
Making sure our parents,
our uncles, our families,

110
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:46,487
these stores, this
town, stays alive.

111
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,922
58 people were killed.

112
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:53,159
Only a quarter of Korean-owned
businesses survived,

113
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,428
either destroyed outright
during the riots

114
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,863
or abandoned afterwards by

115
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:58,665
owners who felt the entire

116
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,433
underpinning of their contract

117
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,035
with America had shifted.

118
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,872
Yet today, Koreatown is
bigger and better and

119
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:09,677
forever changed by
what happened in 1992.

120
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,682
Dong Il Jang, however, is
as unwaveringly old school

121
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,684
as you get.

122
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:21,020
Roy and I sit down with Roy
Kim, whose grandfather

123
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,956
opened the place in 1978.

124
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,025
Like most Korean
restaurants at the time,

125
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,595
you didn't mess with
the original, ever.

126
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:31,263
And like most Korean
father/son relationships,

127
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,934
you obeyed Dad's
wishes no matter what.

128
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,704
My father put all this,
you know, redwood in,

129
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,105
and all this cherry
and all this.

130
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,941
But, to this day, I
can't touch certain

131
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:42,610
things here.

132
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,377
I can see he doesn't let
you change the uniforms

133
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,212
either.

134
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,046
Uh, no.

135
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:47,246
Yeah.

136
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,048
Well, he still controls
the restaurant.

137
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:49,983
You just do the work.

138
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,150
I just do the work.

139
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,387
As a Korean, he knows.

140
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:57,724
We start with bonchon, all
those delicious little

141
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,925
freebie plates of pickles,

142
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,259
preserves, kimchi, pickles,

143
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,228
a spicy squid snack or two.

144
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,830
No bonchon?

145
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,264
No meal.

146
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,066
And you know what this
restaurant has that a lot of

147
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,067
restaurants are going away from?

148
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,637
Is the, um... is the
chair-less rooms.

149
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,739
You don't do the-the feet under?

150
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,940
Knees forward, feet under?

151
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,675
All the-the tea ceremonies.

152
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:15,576
Straight ahead?

153
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:16,809
Oh, no can do.

154
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,445
That was punishment for Koreans.

155
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:19,112
Yeah.

156
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:19,747
That's a punishment.

157
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:21,247
And with the book
over your head.

158
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,248
Oh, for hours.

159
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,315
What would a crime be?

160
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,418
What got you into
that, uh, position?

161
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,586
Yeah, I mean, it could be

162
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:30,423
as-as minimal as a
94 on the test.

163
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,624
Korean parents?

164
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,627
Well, let's just say they
veer towards the strict.

165
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,963
Moms and Dads were not,
shall we say, conflicted

166
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,598
about corporal punishment.

167
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,234
I love that you both
immediately recognize this.

168
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:43,936
Oh, this is the roast gui.

169
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,271
This is what we're known...

170
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,507
It's thinly sliced
rib-eye, marbled rib-eye.

171
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,608
Oh, it's beautiful.

172
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,876
Roast gui.

173
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,310
Thin-sliced rib-eye.

174
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,945
And bulgogi.

175
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,881
Thinly-sliced, fat-marbled

176
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,684
beef, barbecued table-side.

177
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:58,985
For us Koreans, it's kind of

178
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,488
funny that barbecue has become

179
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,122
the gateway to our food, though.

180
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:03,657
Hey, it could be worse.

181
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:04,891
It could be worse, yeah.

182
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:05,559
At least it's delicious.

183
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,193
It's delicious and we're
like, "Okay, this is the-

184
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:08,227
this is the portal."

185
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,696
We're cool with that.

186
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:12,632
Then there's kimchi
bulgogi bokkeumbap.

187
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,366
Basically kimchi fried rice.

188
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,069
But it fries into the
pan like paella.

189
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,472
So many great rice dishes
where that outer layer of

190
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:22,041
crispy stuff is just the best.

191
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,876
The tableside cooking.

192
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,145
I think people overlook that a lot.
You know,

193
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:30,316
this is like crepes suzette,
filleting a Dover sole.

194
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,920
Oh man, that's just
ridiculously delicious.

195
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,888
Will you be doing
this in 20 years?

196
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,223
It won't change.

197
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,425
If we did change tonight,
I would get a complaint.

198
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,494
And you'd have to
talk to your dad.

199
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:42,495
Oh, yeah.

200
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,198
That's-that's a problem.

201
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:51,003
What do you do if you're
a locavore in L.A.?

202
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,172
You look around.

203
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,509
What's local and delicious,
artisanal and authentic,

204
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,044
and as iconically L.A.

205
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,411
as it gets?

206
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,248
If you're Roy Choi,
you see tacos.

207
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,518
And with Kogi Truck, Roy
Choi brought one of the

208
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,453
first great mutation mash-ups

209
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,890
of Korean and Mexican
to the people.

210
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,693
What started as one truck
became four trucks and

211
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,462
three brick-and-mortar
restaurants to go with them.

212
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,365
For me, Kogi was always
one truck in my mind.

213
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,034
But then the lines
got big, you know?

214
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,571
And it evolved.

215
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:25,939
Hola, Herlindo.

216
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,245
Roy trained at the Culinary
Institute of America

217
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,616
and interned at Le Bernardin
in New York City.

218
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,750
He runs his trucks like you'd

219
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,119
expect of someone
with that background.

220
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,322
Within our food media
landscape, we've romanticized

221
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,726
certain compositions of
what a great chef and

222
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,662
a-and-and a great kitchen
are supposed to look and

223
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,763
smell and feel like.

224
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,831
But just because those are

225
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,066
beautiful doesn't mean that
this is not beautiful.

226
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,968
For me, I don't see mustard

227
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,937
plants and sheep grazing.

228
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,973
I see barbed wire and
telephone poles,

229
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,174
and I see puddles.

230
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,077
And, you know, all of that
stuff contribute to the

231
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,613
flavor of the food.

232
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,515
So, it's truly what I call
a terroir, you know, uh,

233
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,017
a regional food.

234
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,419
Okay, gracias.

235
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,555
And they're off.

236
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,931
Every lunch shift
and every evening,

237
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,466
the trucks' locations are
sent out over Twitter.

238
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,802
The locations change every day.

239
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,170
And people flock quicklyry day.

240
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:35,207
To find them, as the
lines can get long.

241
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,010
Very long.

242
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,113
I took a run with Roy as he
made his nightly rounds.

243
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,215
So, how often do you
make the full circuit

244
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,952
between all of your, uh,
various enterprises?

245
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,119
Twice a day, every day,

246
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,488
unless I'm doing something
crazy like this.

247
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,457
So it's kind of like I have

248
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,326
a-a huge Las Vegas hotel,
but the hallways are the

249
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,629
streets.

250
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,131
First stop: Chego, a
rice bowl place in the

251
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,167
Palms neighborhood.

252
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,802
These are my guys right here.

253
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,136
Hola!

254
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,137
Hey, Chef.

255
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,675
Kimchi spam, classic.

256
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:10,309
Yeah, this is the
menu right here.

257
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,978
A big bowl of rice with meat,

258
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,313
vegetables, and lots of flavor,

259
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,248
for less than 10 bucks.

260
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,985
Good deal.

261
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,990
But it's funny to hear
you're so sentimental

262
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,225
about the business
of feeding people.

263
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,661
It's a trippy state
of romanticism,

264
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,830
like I'm very hard-assed, too.

265
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,531
Like, you pack your own shit.

266
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,666
You get what you get.

267
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,168
If you complain, I take the
food out of your hands.

268
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,870
I give you your money back.

269
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,373
But within those rules,
there's a lot of love,

270
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,877
and there's-there's
a lot of care.

271
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,015
Across town in
Venice is A-Frame,

272
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,018
Roy's first brick-and-mortar.

273
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,720
This used to be an IHOP,
so everything's...

274
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:54,854
Oh, yeah?

275
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,255
Yeah, everything's
really narrow.

276
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,524
Ah, hence the, uh, the shape.

277
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,726
It's heavily influenced by

278
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,394
local takes on Hawaiianed
by cooking, not that you'd

279
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,863
necessarily notice.

280
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:08,134
Every dish designed to
be eaten with the hands.

281
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,201
What's good?

282
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,570
The baby back ribs are
air-dried, braised,

283
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,372
then breaded and fried.

284
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,375
Lean cod tacos treated
like shawarma.

285
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,077
Beer can crackling chicken:

286
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,612
it's brined, rotisseried,
then air-dried like

287
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,515
Peking duck, then fried.

288
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,886
Meanwhile, not too far
away, on Sawtelle,

289
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:31,423
a Kogi truck pulls up,
stops, reverses back to the

290
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,658
corner.

291
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,993
Before the awning is even up,

292
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,828
there's already a line.

293
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:36,996
Hungry people have been waiting

294
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,498
in cars or around the corner
ever since the Twitter

295
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,233
announcement 30 minutes ago.

296
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,468
Yeah, this is just.

297
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,303
I feel guilty.

298
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:44,771
I'm jumping the line, right?

299
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,138
Wow. What's the longest line

300
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,940
you've ever had at
one of these things?

301
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,075
600.

302
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,910
600 people for one truck?

303
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,578
Yeah.

304
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,847
The Kogi taco:

305
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,315
double-caramelized Korean

306
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,649
barbecue short rib on fresh

307
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,086
corn tortilla, salsa roja,

308
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,154
cilantro-onion-lime relish, and

309
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,190
a Napa cabbage/romaine slaw ind

310
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,126
a chili-soy vinaigrette.

311
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:10,930
Oh, yeah.

312
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,866
The-the rep for Kogi is
that we go everywhere.

313
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,334
We go to every single corner

314
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,636
of the county and the city.

315
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,705
We're not just going
to the hip areas.

316
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,841
What about fantastically...
Uh, what about Bel Air?

317
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,309
Can you pull up, like, on
a corner in a residential

318
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,443
area in Bel Air?

319
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:24,912
Yeah, yeah. We go.

320
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:25,846
What happens then?

321
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:26,814
Do you get rousted?

322
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:27,514
Or...?

323
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:30,282
No, no, they come out in
the Versace robe and, uh.

324
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,550
That I gotta see.

325
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:32,718
Yeah, yeah.

326
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,487
Beverly Hills, Beverly
Hills, uh, lunch is crazy.

327
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,990
Why should you be excited
about food trucks?

328
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,459
Because they allow
creative chefs like Roy,

329
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,494
without a lot of money,
to start creating and

330
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,797
selling their stuff,
introducing themselves to

331
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,799
the world, without
having to gather up

332
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,668
a million dollars or
credulous partners.

333
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:50,803
And they're affordable.

334
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,038
They're democratic.

335
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,140
And they are faster, better,

336
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:57,009
and infinitely preferable
to fast food like the king

337
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,612
and the clown and the colonel.

338
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,193
Stereotyping?

339
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,395
Coming... Look, how
do I put this?

340
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,065
Good Korean kids grow
up to be doctors,

341
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,567
lawyers, or engineers,
goes the story.

342
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,269
There are expectations.

343
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,238
But what if you're a bad Korean?

344
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,574
What if you were Korean
American and you just

345
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,242
didn't give a...?

346
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,078
What if you looked
around, asked yourself,

347
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,079
"Who am I?

348
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,246
Who am I supposed to be?

349
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,082
Where do I fit in society?"

350
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,516
and were unsatisfied with the

351
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,251
answers you were getting?

352
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,252
What if you were an insanely

353
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,753
talented artist and a small

354
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,090
startup company called Facebook

355
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,758
asked you to do some
murals in their offices,

356
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,694
and they paid you in stock,

357
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,761
and you became
ridiculously wealthy

358
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,964
and you still didn't give a...?

359
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:55,268
Well, then, you might
be David Choe.

360
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,141
Hi.

361
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,141
I'm Dave Choe.

362
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,219
Be like me.

363
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,556
Is that an AK piñata?

364
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,458
That is an AK-47 piñata.

365
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,592
Wow.

366
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,727
So, I mean, this place is in

367
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,329
downtown L.A., so I try to have

368
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,297
as many weapons, like,
hidden throughout.

369
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,334
I got ninja swords and
ninja stars and stuff.

370
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,103
You need. you need a puppy, man.

371
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:31,837
You need a puppy.

372
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,806
I do need a puppy.

373
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,908
I'm going to paint you today.

374
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:36,509
Is that cool?

375
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,510
Yeah, sure.

376
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,845
All right, so, just sit.

377
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:40,780
Sit?

378
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:43,983
Right there. And. sorry.

379
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,386
Don't usually paint this
early in the morning.

380
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,257
Okay.

381
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,860
I'm going to go more
expressionistic,

382
00:14:54,861 --> 00:15:00,632
if you don't mind.

383
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,768
I want to know... you were
on record, you said,

384
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:03,835
you know, uh, young people,

385
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,771
uh, looking to follow
your road to success,

386
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,506
your advice is, whatever you do,

387
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,175
don't date a Korean girl.

388
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:10,542
Oh, okay.

389
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,344
I try to be open-minded
about things, right?

390
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,046
But, well, I'm racist.

391
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,116
You know, uh, for me,
I've given it a sh-shot.

392
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:20,052
And then I end up in a
situation where I feel like

393
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,520
I'm dating my mom.

394
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,821
So, what characteristics, uh,

395
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,857
in common were-were-were-w...
Overbearing.

396
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,826
Overbearing.

397
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:29,795
Uh, jealous. Unreasonable.

398
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,698
Like, unrealistic about life.

399
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,001
Demanding. Like, it's...

400
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,335
I mean, I could go on and on.

401
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,669
But also, the men, too.

402
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,671
Like, if you're a woman, I
wouldn't never recommend

403
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,973
dating a Korean guy.

404
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,674
For the very few women out

405
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,310
there that are into Asian guys,

406
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,711
if you are going to go that

407
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,015
route, definitely go Chinese.

408
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,354
Yeah, come check it out.

409
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,223
Oh, yeah.

410
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,225
Whoa, awesome.

411
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,894
Wow.

412
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:03,496
I don't know;

413
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,397
what do you think?

414
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,698
Dude. I'm honored.

415
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,500
I've never had my
portrait done before.

416
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,169
Thank you, man.

417
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:09,736
Hey, man.

418
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:10,537
You're welcome.

419
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,871
And this shit going to be
worth some money on eBay

420
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,841
for sure.

421
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,547
Now I'm definitely
ready for Sizzler.

422
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,815
Nice.

423
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,089
Standing tall and prominent

424
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,590
amongst the many Asian and

425
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,759
Central American restaurants
in the community,

426
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,894
one place holds an unexpectedly

427
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,596
cherished position in the

428
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:41,233
collective memories of many
second-generation Korean

429
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,568
Americans.

430
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,537
I am personally unfamiliar
with the Sizzler brand.

431
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,240
Oh, I know it by name, but
never have I managed to

432
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,043
actually cross its doors.

433
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,278
After you.

434
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,880
Oh, thank you.

435
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,083
Wow.

436
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,617
How are you doing today?

437
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,419
I'm doing good, thank you.

438
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:00,387
How about yourself?

439
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:01,388
I'm doing fantastic.

440
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,122
I got my Sizzler outfit on.

441
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,456
So, here's the thing.

442
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,991
You can get, like, a steak and

443
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,626
then add the salad bar with it.

444
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:08,461
Right.

445
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:09,895
You get the best
bang for your buck.

446
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:10,962
Or you can just get
the salad bar.

447
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,498
I'm gonna have a
little bit of steak.

448
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:13,799
I am gonna go traditional and

449
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,134
just get just the salad bar.

450
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,302
And just the salad bar only.

451
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:16,969
Yeah. Thank you.

452
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,104
You can have a seat
anywhere you like.

453
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,073
Terrific. Thanks.

454
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,012
Excellent.

455
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:27,980
Oh, yeah.

456
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:28,981
Pouring for your elders.

457
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:30,516
Oh, now you're getting
all Korean on me.

458
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,817
Yeah. Super embarrassed right

459
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:32,851
now, because we're in Koreatown

460
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,653
and I'm taking you to eat at

461
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,021
Sizzler, which, for a lot of

462
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:39,291
Koreans, is the best
food in Koreatown. Um.

463
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,627
So, if you were eating
non-Korean, this was it?

464
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:42,861
We never ate out, ever.

465
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,165
And if we did, it
was McDonald's.

466
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,999
And if it was a birthday
and a special celebration,

467
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,635
you wanted to kick it up a
notch and go a little bit

468
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,971
more special, then
it was Sizzler.

469
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,642
This is a judgment-free zone,

470
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,210
where there are no mistakes,

471
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,146
a world to explore incongruous

472
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,182
combinations without
shame or guilt,

473
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:06,152
free of criticism
from snarkologists,

474
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:10,522
because there are no
snarkologists at Sizzler.

475
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,991
Obviously here's all the
accouterments for making a

476
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,461
nice nacho, taco salad.
Here... Right.

477
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:16,795
All the stuff for the.

478
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:17,364
Pasta.

479
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,131
Pasta, spaghetti, whatever.

480
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:20,366
The move is you get a hard taco

481
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,733
shell and you put meatballs in

482
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,034
it. This is Italian/Mexican

483
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,670
dining, and you make a meatball

484
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,372
taco. And there's nowhere else

485
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,739
in the world where you can have

486
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,209
this. You put three meatballs in

487
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,044
the taco, some guacamole, and

488
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,681
then you put all this nacho

489
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,882
cheese, all this other stuff.

490
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,317
Oh, I-I know what I'm doing.

491
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,385
I'm going for the full South of

492
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:40,519
the Border experience here.

493
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,388
All right.

494
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:42,322
Well, there you go.

495
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,223
Oh, no, no.

496
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:44,590
I'm not kidding around here.

497
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:48,060
Oh, yeah, now we're
talking, my friend.

498
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,897
It's a little bit nicer
than I remember.

499
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,832
There it is.

500
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,835
That's the best bread
that you can get,

501
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,337
so you tell me if you like that.

502
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,038
Oh, now, wait a minute.

503
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,071
Are you saying that the

504
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,407
cheese toast is complimentary?

505
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,342
It's complimentary.

506
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:03,609
And once we found that out,

507
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,076
we would order stacks of it.

508
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,078
So, it was our favorite
part of Sizzler.

509
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,079
And we were like, "We need to

510
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,417
figure out how to
manufacture this at home."

511
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,553
So, were you good Sizzler
customers, your family?

512
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:15,422
Do you think they were happy

513
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,189
to see you when you come in?

514
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,090
I mean.

515
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:19,759
Um.

516
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,293
I love this dish, man.

517
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:21,927
I might-I might, uh... when
I go back, I might have

518
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,595
to have a meatball taco.

519
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,697
Um, so, we didn't we, like,

520
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,032
gooched the system a little bit,

521
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,435
but not like
completely abused it.

522
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,602
There would be the guilt

523
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,604
associated with
we never eat out,

524
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,573
but now we're going out to

525
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,774
eat, so you better... eat.

526
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,944
You got to put down at
least three plates.

527
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,746
So, what'd you think
of the bread?

528
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:41,414
It's delicious.

529
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,614
Yeah. It's the best.

530
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,650
Oh, I totally get why this
would be a wonderland.

531
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,752
Yeah, everything's really good.

532
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:49,221
For you, Sizzler, a
happy place, still.

533
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,456
Lots of memories.

534
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,958
It's satisfying.

535
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,096
We need more of
this cheese bread.

536
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,508
Something Dave Choe and Roy
Choi have in common is

537
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,344
that they may be Korean
American, but they are also

538
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,746
very much creatures of L.A.

539
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,415
And what is L.A.?

540
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,251
L.A. is Mexican,
Central American,

541
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:24,690
Filipino, Vietnamese, Thai,
Samoan, Bangladeshi.

542
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,525
Everybody who's left their mark

543
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,527
continues to shape the town,

544
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,496
determine its character.

545
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:33,765
K-Town exists right upside
its Latino neighbors, and

546
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,302
I guess it's natural
that both Choe and Choi

547
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:40,239
identify very much with
Mexican street culture.

548
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,143
Few things embody that
particularly Southern

549
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,445
California Latino street

550
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:50,750
culture more than low-riding.

551
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,727
Estevan Oriol is a photographer.

552
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,828
Go on the other
side of that pole.

553
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,297
Chronicler of everything
iconic at the crossroads of

554
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:09,801
hip-hop, design, tattooing,
fashion, and low-riding.

555
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,571
The old timers, they
used to cut the coils or

556
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:13,972
put bricks or sandbags in their

557
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,741
trunk to make them lower.

558
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:19,811
And then around the '70s
is when it got popular.

559
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,981
Why these particular
models of cars?

560
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,083
It's pretty much always
been, uh, late '50s,

561
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,919
all the way through the
'60s, and into the '70s.

562
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,355
And then the '80s came up.

563
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:30,422
They started bringing in the

564
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:34,225
Cadillacs and the Regals.

565
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,061
The most classic, well-known car

566
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:39,499
for low-riding probably
is the '64 Impala.

567
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,271
How many Korean
low-riders are there?

568
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,606
There's a few Asian ones

569
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,274
sprinkled in the other clubs.

570
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,378
More Asians, more more
Koreans than 15 years ago?

571
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,713
We're seeing a crossover
with the food.

572
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:55,348
Right.

573
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:58,384
Uh... For the most part,
things are starting to get

574
00:21:58,385 --> 00:21:59,185
a lot more open.

575
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:00,218
If you're asking, I think

576
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,453
there's going to be a lot more

577
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,956
Asian/Hispanic mixed babies
coming up in the future.

578
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:06,559
I ain't mad at that.

579
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,196
Ideal low-riding, is about
getting appreciated by

580
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,931
the people who best appreciate

581
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:17,268
the traditions and techniques,
the getting it right.

582
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,506
For that, you head to East L.A.

583
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:27,312
The most famous, notorious
street in L.A. is,

584
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:28,614
uh, Whittier Boulevard,

585
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:30,482
because of the history of it.

586
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:33,819
And then Crenshaw Boulevard
and South Central.

587
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,821
So, that's gonna be your
most critical audience?

588
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,723
And, uh, mo- and at the
same most appreciative?

589
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:38,658
Yeah, the ones that you want

590
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,158
to see your car, you know?

591
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,627
It's a slow-moving piece of

592
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:43,829
art. And you treat the car like

593
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,566
a piece of art, acutely
aware of the dangers: cops,

594
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,234
for whom you are a target;

595
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,669
potholes;

596
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,804
other cars.

597
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,273
In East L.A., you see
people ooh and ah.

598
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,508
You see expressions change

599
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,109
from, "Who the... is that?"

600
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,146
to, "Nice ride."

601
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,415
That was, like, a
full-fledged gang member.

602
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,083
Yeah.

603
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,017
You know, giving us, like,
props, giving us respect,

604
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,019
you know?

605
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,088
First you build a
car for yourself.

606
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,023
But at the same time you're

607
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:13,024
building it for the
streets, you know?

608
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,526
You're building it
for the people.

609
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,663
You want them to appreciate it.

610
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:29,040
Within the borders of Koreatown,

611
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,809
it's not just Koreans.

612
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,378
There are new
arrivals every day.

613
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,882
There is, in fact, an
official Little Bangladesh

614
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,817
right in the middle of K-town.

615
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:40,552
Oh, man, this is all so.

616
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:41,653
It smells so good in here.

617
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,655
Uh, yeah, this is going to work.

618
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,457
So you're not short of
options around here.

619
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,392
Nah. You can get tacos
across the street,

620
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,060
Korean bibimbap right next door,

621
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,996
and then get goat stew.

622
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:54,733
You can pray to
Mohammed or Buddha.

623
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,134
A tiny mosque next door where

624
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:59,505
services are held
five times a day.

625
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,006
Just talking to a guy in
the parking lot who said,

626
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,241
"This is the first Little
Bangladesh in America."

627
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,043
Yeah.

628
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:05,744
And that just happened,
like, two years ago.

629
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,713
Like, we went to
sleep, we woke up,

630
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:08,981
and it was Little Bangladesh.

631
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:17,322
Here at Sawada, step right
in to some curried goat,

632
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:21,026
samosas, tandoori chicken.

633
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:21,928
Oh, yeah, and this:

634
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:25,564
Lahori fish curry, with no
small amount of chilies.

635
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,600
It's such fragrant,
aromatic, delicious food.

636
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,368
This is really good.

637
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,703
What good food are you likely

638
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,606
to find within the
confines of Koreatown?

639
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,275
We have El Salvadoran and
Guatemalan all around.

640
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:38,944
Koreans all throughout.

641
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:41,446
Pakistani and Bangladesh food.

642
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:45,016
Yeah, Oaxaca takes over
all of Eighth Street.

643
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,785
Why Oaxaca? Just that's
the way it worked out?

644
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:47,786
Mm hmm.

645
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:48,721
Well, you know how it goes.

646
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:49,388
Yeah.

647
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:50,289
One guy showed up.

648
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,057
Yeah.

649
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:52,958
Filipino fast food
just behind us.

650
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:53,626
Mm hmm.

651
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:55,226
And then a bunch of
riff-raffs in between.

652
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,095
Yeah. Well, Filipinos oughta

653
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,029
be very proud of their food.

654
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,630
Mm hmm.

655
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:58,897
Underrepresented.

656
00:24:58,898 --> 00:24:59,632
I think they're going through

657
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:00,533
kind of what we went through,

658
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:01,567
where the glass hasn't been

659
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,769
broken yet to-to translate it

660
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,971
but still keep the
core and soul of it.

661
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,940
But it tastes delicious.

662
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:12,911
A few blocks over, the
iconic Filipino fast food

663
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,080
chain Jollibee's.

664
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:18,483
Laugh all you want,
but ask any Filipino.

665
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,818
They love this drive-through

666
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,386
mutation for specialties like

667
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,488
this fried Spam sandwich thing.

668
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,324
But it's the desserts where
it gets really crazy.

669
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,926
Decisions, decisions.

670
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,060
Here we go.

671
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:32,831
Uh, we'll take one Aloha
burger and then one Spam

672
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:34,432
little big bite.

673
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:35,801
All right. Anything else?

674
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:39,671
Uh, let's do a Halo halo, and that's it.
All right.

675
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,506
Oh, look at that.

676
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:42,841
What is what-what is that?

677
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,275
That's a halo halo.

678
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,144
Oh, yeah, halo halo.

679
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:49,014
Dig deep and you hit delicious
stratas of red beans,

680
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,515
white beans, and chickpeas,

681
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,685
cubes of red and green
Jell-O, young white coconut,

682
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,154
shaved ice- and is that flan?

683
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,657
It makes no goddamn
sense at all.

684
00:25:58,658 --> 00:25:59,592
I love it.

685
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:02,661
Part of every Pinoy
Filipino's life, halo halo.

686
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:03,362
Nutsy, man.

687
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:04,863
I got to take a picture of that.

688
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:07,666
It's oddly beautiful.

689
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:08,667
All right.

690
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:09,368
All right.

691
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,202
You know I'm getting a bite

692
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:10,937
of that little what is it?

693
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:11,638
A little.

694
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:12,338
It's a little big bite.

695
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:13,272
Little big bite.

696
00:26:13,273 --> 00:26:15,540
Favorite thing in the world.

697
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,843
No, don't say that.

698
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,180
That's actually... I like that.

699
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,049
It's good, right?

700
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:27,552
Aloha. I mean, it
just sounds magical.

701
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,154
Is there, like, pineapple
in there or something?

702
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,889
Yes. Hence the "aloha."

703
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,458
That's a very tasty burger.

704
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,860
Nice char.

705
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:35,695
Asian fast food.

706
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:37,663
It's fast food, but
it's made by like it

707
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:40,165
was just a single family
owned restaurant.

708
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,067
What family made this?

709
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:42,300
Yeah, maybe.

710
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,035
Maybe-maybe not your family.

711
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:43,803
The Jetsons.

712
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:46,471
You know?

713
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:47,406
You like it?

714
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,074
It's actually very tasty.

715
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:51,176
Every single thing
you like here.

716
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,913
Wow. There's so
much I don't know.

717
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:15,901
It's true, Dad.

718
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:17,502
We all look the same.

719
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,239
I love it.

720
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,108
He may be a Korean gone bad,

721
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,710
but Dave Choe still tries,

722
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:27,746
best he can, to be a good son.

723
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:28,947
He bought them this house in

724
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:33,251
Los Feliz and visits for
family meals often.

725
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,753
In fact, when we first met,

726
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,254
sensing it had been a long time

727
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,355
without a true home-cooked time

728
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,557
meal, he invited me
to dinner with them.

729
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:42,260
So, guests are not unusual.

730
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,930
Jane Cho is an amazing cook.

731
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:46,765
It's going to be very delicious.

732
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,067
Mom? Dad?

733
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,301
Look who's here.

734
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:50,837
Hello.

735
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:51,937
Mom, Tony's here.

736
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:52,905
Can you smell something?

737
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:53,906
Oh, yeah.

738
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:54,406
Yeah.

739
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,141
Good stuff.

740
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:56,908
Yeah, all the good
stuff's coming.

741
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:01,447
Maybe somebody going
to hire me later.

742
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,317
Okay, which ones are you?

743
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:08,619
Are you the eldest?

744
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,620
I'm the middle.

745
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,057
I'm the suicidal pirate.

746
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:14,293
Oh, already signs
of trouble appear.

747
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,796
My older brother is the
hip-hop Santa, and my...

748
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:18,597
He was the oldest.

749
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:19,298
Right.

750
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:20,565
He'd beat me up.

751
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,800
I'd beat him up.

752
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,902
And then he would just cry.

753
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,670
I'll show you my dad's painting.

754
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:26,305
Hey, Dad?

755
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:27,073
Yeah?

756
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:28,673
Hey, come over
here for a second.

757
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:29,808
When did you paint this, Dad?

758
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:30,809
30 years ago?

759
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,244
Uh, '73. 1973.

760
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:36,481
Every Christmas, he
unrolls it, um, and just,

761
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:38,284
like, Scotch tapes
it to the wall.

762
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,786
And my Mom's the artist
in the family now.

763
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:42,321
So, this is a family of artists.

764
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,190
The Choe's are devout

765
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:45,824
Christians, which is not unusual

766
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,258
in the Korean community.

767
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,994
But they are unusual in that

768
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:51,629
they're both artists of a sort.

769
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,199
Jane treats the house like
an ongoing art project,

770
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,768
drawing sunglasses
on family pictures,

771
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,504
stapling angels to Dave's
paintings that have hung

772
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:02,040
in the White House, getting
crazy with the glue gun,

773
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,042
adorning wreaths with Happy Meal

774
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:07,378
toys, sticker-bombing the
kitchen with birds, cows,

775
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,481
spaceships piloted
by her three boys.

776
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:14,519
She is relentlessly,
energetically, and inarguably

777
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,854
creative.

778
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:16,888
She brainwashed me.

779
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:19,324
From the time we were
kids, she'd-she was like,

780
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:20,691
"You're the best
artist in the world.

781
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,127
You're the best
artist in the world."

782
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:22,995
You are.

783
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:23,995
Oh, thanks.

784
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,563
But now she's telling me
she's going to be the best

785
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,398
artist in the world.

786
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,967
So, she's very competitive.

787
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:30,969
She said she's gonna destroy me.

788
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:31,970
Awesome.

789
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:38,209
Food is ready.

790
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,511
So, do you want to explain
what everything is, Mom?

791
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,981
The food I prepared tonight

792
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,884
is a very common Korean food.

793
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:50,655
Which is a beef ribs, uh, stew.

794
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,223
The kimchi's looking fresh.

795
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,825
Yeah, the kimchi's fresh.

796
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:56,061
Today is, uh, chestnut rice.

797
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:58,163
No one has this kind of rice.

798
00:29:58,164 --> 00:29:59,397
It's a special rice.

799
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,599
Special rice for Tony, you know.

800
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,401
And then stuffed peppers.

801
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,536
Oh, that's David's favorite.

802
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,438
Chung po mook:

803
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:08,206
seaweed and jellied mung bean.

804
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:11,242
Vermicelli noodles
with shitake mushrooms

805
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,510
and vegetables.

806
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:16,081
Avocado egg rolls, fried
squid, and shrimps.

807
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17,448
Potato pancake.

808
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,749
Often at the Cho house there's

809
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,419
a few Mexican dishes
sprinkled in as well.

810
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,256
It is always a great meal,
I can tell you that.

811
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,357
Thanks, Mom.

812
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:27,425
This is delicious.

813
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:28,560
This is awesome.

814
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,929
It is indeed. Thank you.

815
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,364
I love it.

816
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:36,567
During the riots of '92, Jim
and Jane Choe worked as

817
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,970
real estate agents and
property managers.

818
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,238
So the destruction in Koreatown

819
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:44,042
had a direct impact
on their lives.

820
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:45,576
The Chos watched from home

821
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:49,047
as the chaos unfolded on TV.

822
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,949
After the riots, Jim
Choe wrote a letter

823
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,319
to the editor that published
in the L.A. Times.

824
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,822
I am extremely angry
with the LAPD

825
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,558
for their outrageous action.

826
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,928
While the cops let looters

827
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:08,967
run wild and rape our city,
they somehow had time to

828
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:13,905
bother Korean shop owners
guarding their stores.

829
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:16,107
How can the owner of a business

830
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,409
just sit back and watch his

831
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,414
life be burned to the ground?

832
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:26,584
David would have a
different reaction.

833
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,354
My brother stole a car,
and we went into, like,

834
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,455
all the neighborhoods and

835
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:34,125
then quickly realized it
wasn't, like, about race.

836
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,793
It was just about
people stealing stuff.

837
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,795
And-but we were out looting.

838
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:38,964
We were causing chaos.

839
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:41,332
And, you know, I don't think
we got anything good.

840
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,533
I think I got a TV stand.

841
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,435
Was it life-changing for you?

842
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:45,536
It's like you grow up and

843
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,772
you things are explained to you.

844
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:48,707
Like, here's the police.

845
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,541
They're not doing anything
they're supposed to do.

846
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:51,842
There's just, like, normal men

847
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,178
and women of society just, like,

848
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:54,645
acting like animals.

849
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,847
And I was like, "Oh,
everything I've,

850
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,683
like, been taught and-and

851
00:31:58,684 --> 00:31:59,985
learned my whole life is just

852
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:01,953
disintegrating before my eyes."

853
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:04,222
But, in the end, we're-you

854
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:07,292
know, from great disasters
come great things, right?

855
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,027
I mean, Koreatown burned down.

856
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,129
But it's like we own L.A. now.

857
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,297
It's, like, half of L.A.

858
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,699
Now it's Korean culture.

859
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,469
K-pop and Psy all over the world

860
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,071
influence, you know?

861
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:20,973
The filmmakers.

862
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:22,974
All the-all the top, uh,
Korean filmmakers are in

863
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:23,975
Hollywood.

864
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:24,710
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

865
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,710
Korean, uh, culture.

866
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:26,712
What about me?

867
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:27,646
Yeah, you.

868
00:32:27,647 --> 00:32:28,879
Artists, right.

869
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,381
Yeah, right. Yeah.

870
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:29,982
Except you.

871
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:30,816
Sorry.

872
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:32,683
Sorry, David.

873
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,086
It's incredible.

874
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,324
Today, I went into
all the ways...

875
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:39,891
Different ways you guys used

876
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:41,226
to beat us when we were kids.

877
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:43,594
The stress positions,
like, you know.

878
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:44,363
Yeah, but what.

879
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:45,430
All the Korean punishments.

880
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,932
What's remarkable to
me is that every kid.

881
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:48,567
Right.

882
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:49,667
I mean, all Korean kids.

883
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:50,735
Yeah, all Korean kids.

884
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:51,902
The same position.

885
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,338
Holding-you either hold a book.

886
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:53,939
Oh, yeah.

887
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,073
That's the way we learn from

888
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:56,841
the generation to generation.

889
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,209
We don't know why.

890
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,710
To take a peek into the dark

891
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,446
heart of the Korean psyche,

892
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:04,449
maybe it helps to get
familiar with Han.

893
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,285
It's a concept that,
for non-Koreans,

894
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,787
can be difficult to fully grasp.

895
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,022
All right.

896
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,523
You want it? Here we go.

897
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,426
Han denotes a collective
feeling of oppression and

898
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:17,762
isolation in the face
of overwhelming odds.

899
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,430
It connotes aspects of lament

900
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,799
and unavenged injustice.

901
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,933
Wow.

902
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,802
In some occasions,
anthropologists have recognized

903
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:27,705
Han as cultural-specific
medical condition.

904
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,475
Someone who dies
of Han is... Right.

905
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:31,543
Is said to have died of

906
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,281
It's a heartburn.

907
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:36,882
It's a heartburn.

908
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:39,084
Wow. I mean, the-uh,
it's been described to

909
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:40,718
me in a way that made
it sound benign.

910
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,253
That-this is a burning, uh,

911
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,455
sense of injustice, besiegement,

912
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,624
and-and desire for revenge.

913
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,460
The Han is the reason why,
like, we are who we are.

914
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,795
But it's also the same reason

915
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,098
why I won't marry
a Korean woman.

916
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,999
No. You never know.

917
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,567
No, I know, Mom.

918
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,271
He's cute.

919
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,617
Main drag of K-Town.

920
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,320
Another mini mall among many.

921
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:16,987
Karaoke?

922
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:17,656
No.

923
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:19,857
This is the best
dumpling spot in town.

924
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,326
My mom would just order all

925
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,327
these dumplings and just, like,

926
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:23,361
leave 'em on my door, 'cause,

927
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:25,162
uh, she's not allowed in my house.
And then...

928
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,865
I just said, uh, "Where
are you getting these?"

929
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,634
You know, my mom likes
to withhold information.

930
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,536
So, I finally got it out of her.

931
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:34,505
Myung In Dumplings,
where they serve a mix

932
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,975
between Korean and Chinese.

933
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:42,012
Each plate handmade
to order, my friends.

934
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:45,150
Opened in 2007 on
Olympic Boulevard,

935
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:47,852
it's run by Yu Jin,
a Korean by way of

936
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:50,456
Shenyang Province in China.

937
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,192
Been coming here for
about two years now.

938
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:54,993
Uh huh?

939
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:56,194
There's no one ever in here.

940
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:57,362
Every time I've ever come

941
00:34:57,363 --> 00:34:59,397
in-and, uh, I don't
understand how they're open.

942
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,132
They're the best
dumplings I've ever had.

943
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,367
Maybe people just get 'em to go.

944
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:03,668
Right.

945
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:06,537
They all look like
buttholes, actually.

946
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,874
But... Kind of. Yeah,
pre-prolapse.

947
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,411
Wang mandu.

948
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:14,745
King dumpling.

949
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,848
Thick dough, stuffed to
the gills with pork,

950
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,050
kimchi, and vegetables.

951
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:24,822
Precisely made,
weighed, and crimped.

952
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,591
Steamed until soft.

953
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,592
Eat.

954
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:28,726
Wow.

955
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,761
That's nearly the
size of your head.

956
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,530
Yeah, you know, it's like pizza.

957
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:33,265
I'll eat 'em cold, too.

958
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:33,832
Right.

959
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,733
Save two and have
'em for dinner.

960
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,067
And mandu.

961
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,604
Smaller, with thinner
dumpling skins,

962
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:42,541
served with red chili paste.

963
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,376
Those are the dessert ones.

964
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,111
Those got red bean in it.

965
00:35:46,112 --> 00:35:47,313
Oh, God. Wow.

966
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,850
Oh, these are delicious.

967
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,785
These are just, like, so huge.

968
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:55,786
Go for it.

969
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,261
So, would this be classically
post-drinking food or

970
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:04,463
pre-drinking food?

971
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:06,897
Lay down a base of
absorbent material?

972
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,866
Yeah, I mean, there's
a lot of bread here.

973
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:09,601
But I've already drank.

974
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:12,237
I'm just, uh, falling under
peer pressure right now.

975
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:15,574
I'll be one of the
cool guys, so.

976
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,447
I like this place already.

977
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:24,114
Good signage. It's important.

978
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,716
Yeah. The sign's awesome.

979
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:28,319
If that sign does
not sing to you,

980
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,887
then we cannot be friends.

981
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,422
Mari, hi.

982
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,457
Hi, David. How are you?

983
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,458
This is my Uncle Tony.

984
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:34,393
This is Mari.

985
00:36:34,394 --> 00:36:35,826
How you doing?

986
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,963
This is, uh, Harry
Kim, aka Guam Cruise.

987
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,431
Here's more Koreans right here.

988
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:41,300
Here's more Koreans.

989
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,934
Some friends of Cho seem
to favor this place.

990
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,437
They are a thirsty
and diverse bunch.

991
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:47,472
I'm asking everybody:

992
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:48,973
stress position as a child?

993
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:51,175
Did you have to do the,
uh, knees forward?

994
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,977
Oh, you know about this.

995
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,078
It went right into it.

996
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,246
Stress positions?

997
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:56,314
Oh, we did that.

998
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:57,482
You did that? See?

999
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:58,284
There's this.

1000
00:36:58,284 --> 00:36:58,950
There's this, too.

1001
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,751
The speed with which they
assume the position.

1002
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,987
You had to hold a bucket
over your head with water.

1003
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:04,021
Water? Wow.

1004
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,823
What if your arms get tired?

1005
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:06,957
They make you do it again

1006
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,159
another 45 minutes to
an hour, you know?

1007
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,495
The whole thing is
doing it again.

1008
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:12,029
Look, I'm not Korean.

1009
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,097
I'm not Asian.

1010
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,799
I'm a white boy from the suburb.

1011
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,867
But I noticed something
over time in my K-Town

1012
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:17,836
adventure.

1013
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:20,004
Similar anecdotes,
you might say.

1014
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,272
You know, they've done
this quite a bit.

1015
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,707
So they came up with a new one.

1016
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:23,542
I was very aware that all my

1017
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:24,975
Korean friends-no matter how

1018
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,711
creative or successful-seem

1019
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:29,280
strangely haunted by something.

1020
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,148
But I never knew this.

1021
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:31,583
How do you do it?

1022
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,784
Oh, the... It goes
up the ass like this,

1023
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,020
and then-it's like opening up

1024
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,488
a umbrella inside someone.

1025
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,789
You do this to your friends?

1026
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,691
Or college.

1027
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:40,392
Or college.

1028
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:41,459
They think it's hilarious.

1029
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,394
And adults do that
shit to each other.

1030
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:46,130
What the hell that's
about, I can only guess.

1031
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,965
Cheers... Cheers.

1032
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,200
Koreans gone bad.

1033
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,704
You're Korean now, officially.

1034
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,223
Pretty much any Korean
you meet anywhere,

1035
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,660
you can take it for
granted they like food,

1036
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,194
that they're passionate about

1037
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,763
food, particularly their food,

1038
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,197
which of all the immigrant

1039
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:23,401
cuisines has probably been
messed with the least.

1040
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,336
Unlike many other new arrivals,

1041
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:27,071
Koreans seem to have been the

1042
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,240
most unwilling to
accommodate Western tastes,

1043
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,376
Maybe that's why it took us so

1044
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:33,778
much time to love the stuff.

1045
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:36,947
Beverly Tofu House, like
so many of K-Town's

1046
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,884
finer establishments, is
tucked away in the corner

1047
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:41,386
of a strip mall.

1048
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:42,953
This is one of my
favorite spots.

1049
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,755
This is where I've been
coming for almost 20 years.

1050
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:45,890
This is a soup that's just,

1051
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:48,793
like-it's kind of Korean,
but its really more L.A.,

1052
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:49,461
and so.

1053
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:51,796
So this is not a direct
transplant from Korea?

1054
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:54,465
It became what we're about
to have here in L.A.

1055
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:55,466
Interesting.

1056
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,701
They're different because of

1057
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:58,569
the ingredients
we couldn't find.

1058
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,137
Right.

1059
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,105
But never thinking about

1060
00:39:00,106 --> 00:39:01,939
pleasing the American palate,

1061
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,941
just to make ourselves happy.

1062
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:06,811
Soondubu is the thing to get.

1063
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:08,379
A fiery, tongue-searing,

1064
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,415
ass-burning tofu soup that'll

1065
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:12,450
make you forget every bad thing

1066
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,985
you ever thought about tofu.

1067
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:18,423
A spicy, spicy red broth
and tofu are the base.

1068
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:21,291
We're talking soft tofu
here, with the texture of,

1069
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,593
like, burrata.

1070
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,629
From there, you got a
handful of variations.

1071
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,763
But the most common is with

1072
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,565
kimchi and a bit of everything.

1073
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:30,468
Beef, oysters, mussels, clams.

1074
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:32,102
Oh, and tableside?

1075
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,638
They crack an egg in there.

1076
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,440
Wow.

1077
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:37,074
Right in there. Cool.

1078
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,477
That looks completely awesome.

1079
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,812
Well, we-we better
wait for this to cool,

1080
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:42,947
I'm guessing?

1081
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,148
Yeah.

1082
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:44,950
So, how do we eat this?

1083
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,517
We just spoon it over rice?

1084
00:39:45,518 --> 00:39:47,752
Uh, yeah, yeah,
spoon it over rice.

1085
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,787
Mix it in.

1086
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,656
Mm. That's good.

1087
00:39:51,657 --> 00:39:52,823
Mm.

1088
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:53,991
Yeah, all tofu should be spicy,

1089
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,026
by my way of thinking.

1090
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,027
It's so good.

1091
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:59,296
Yeah. It's really good.

1092
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,330
Koreans can well remember

1093
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,666
when nobody was interested in

1094
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:04,101
their food. was interested
in Now it's confusingly

1095
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,603
au courant.

1096
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:07,104
Must be strange for the owners,

1097
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,172
who've just been doing what

1098
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,340
they've been doing for years.

1099
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,176
Like, for example, like,
us sitting here like this,

1100
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,144
the questions a lot of people

1101
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,613
are asking me in Korean, like,

1102
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,448
I'm telling them we're filming,

1103
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:20,451
you know, we're trying to
show a piece of Koreatown.

1104
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:22,352
The-the number one
question is they're not mad

1105
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,321
or vindictive is, "Why?"

1106
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:25,290
It's still, "Why?"

1107
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,491
Like, why.

1108
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:27,358
Why would we be interested?

1109
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,226
Why would we be interested?

1110
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:29,694
Why would you waste your time?

1111
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:31,161
There's other things to do.

1112
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,030
It's an extraordinarily

1113
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:33,330
beautiful and delicious thing.

1114
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,499
But, see, that's the thing,

1115
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,401
is the beauty is just
already a given.

1116
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:39,036
It's already a part
of the fabric.

1117
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,539
So it's like, you know,
why congratulate you?

1118
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,540
You know?

1119
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,374
There's no reason to
congratulate you,

1120
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,409
because this is like what we do.

1121
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,577
That sounds awful, honestly.

1122
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,579
That sounds, like, totally joy.

1123
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,548
It's, like, totally joyless.

1124
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:52,017
Yeah.

1125
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:53,851
Uh, what do your parents
want you to be when

1126
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,252
you grow up?

1127
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,722
For me, a doctor or lawyer.

1128
00:40:57,723 --> 00:40:59,590
Right. You're obviously
not a doctor or a lawyer.

1129
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:00,559
Did you finish college?

1130
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,826
I finished college and I went

1131
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,594
to one year of law
school and I walked out.

1132
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,395
Right. So, you're a bad Korean.

1133
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,264
Yeah, I'm a bad Korean.

1134
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:09,099
If I was a mediocre accountant,

1135
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,435
it'd be better than
being a top chef.

1136
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:12,903
Uh, according to who?

1137
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:14,238
According to Korean culture.

1138
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:14,773
Right.

1139
00:41:14,774 --> 00:41:17,041
According to Korean
uncles and aunts.

1140
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,743
And it's just-it
doesn't register that

1141
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:19,844
that is a profession.

1142
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:20,746
You know?

1143
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:21,713
I wouldn't have to explain

1144
00:41:21,714 --> 00:41:23,748
myself if I just
said I was a CPA.

1145
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:24,583
Right.

1146
00:41:24,584 --> 00:41:28,085
Never. You know, That's-that's.
..that's weird...

1147
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,120
I know. You still got
some 'splaining to do.

1148
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:34,424
Still. To just get it across
that I... that I cook,

1149
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,593
and that there was this

1150
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:36,461
phenomenon that happened on the

1151
00:41:36,462 --> 00:41:38,228
streets of L.A. that changed

1152
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:42,199
and opened up Korean
culture to-to the world.

1153
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,468
What does it mean to
be Korean American?

1154
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,537
Does one create one's own world?

1155
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:47,438
I don't know that I'm any

1156
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,306
smarter about that now than

1157
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,641
when I first came to K-Town

1158
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,877
in the middle of the night
and discovered a strange

1159
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:54,612
and fabulous and delicious

1160
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:57,615
slice of America I'd
never known was there.

1161
00:41:57,616 --> 00:42:00,686
But I'm trying to figure it out.
