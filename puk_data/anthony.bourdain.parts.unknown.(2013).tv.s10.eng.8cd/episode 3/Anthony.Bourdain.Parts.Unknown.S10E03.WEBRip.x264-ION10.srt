Thank you.

716
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,395
You don't... you don't tilt your
glass when you're pouring there?

717
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,764
I do, I'm just lazy.

718
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,131
Man, you guys are harsh.

719
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,767
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

720
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,462
I'm gonna be reading

722
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:48,307
The food here is
really, really good.

723
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,542
We're seeing quite a bit
of evolution going on.

724
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:51,810
Mm-hmm.

725
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,779
We're not all
sit-at-home moms anymore.

726
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,114
Not many people
want to pound yam.

727
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,883
She certainly does not
want to pound yam.

728
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,050
- Nope.
- And I'm sure

729
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,719
when she's getting married,

730
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,255
one of her gifts
to her husband's house

731
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:05,357
will not be a mortar
and a pestle.

732
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,125
- Unlike 20 or 30 years ago.
- It will be

733
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,827
a food processor, most likely.
Right.

734
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,663
And personally,
I think, maybe people...

735
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:15,166
Women, my generation, might have
failed people like her

736
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,968
by not passing things on.

737
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:20,272
But now,
thanks to food bloggers,

738
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:22,441
the younger ladies have...

739
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:24,476
- An avenue to learn.
- An avenue to, you know,

740
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,645
get this information without
depending on their mom.

741
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:30,749
How much interest in food
is there these days?

742
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,183
More?
More.

743
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,852
- Nigerians are big on meat.
- Yeah.

744
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,354
- Yes.
- So when you see

745
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,222
that we have a few
vegan chefs, people...

746
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,224
- Wow, vegans.
- Yes.

747
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,359
In... in Nigeria.
Yeah.

748
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:42,127
I think that shows you

749
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,963
just how much where people are
finding their niche here.

750
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,432
- Yeah.
- But you know,

751
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:48,500
that's for a certain
social class.

752
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:50,769
The bulk of the people still...

753
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,771
I mean, they don't have
access to the Internet.

754
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,606
- I don't think they care.
- They don't care.

755
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,501
- Yeah, that's the difference.
- You know, the guy

756
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:57,869
just wants to fill his tummy
for the day, you know.

757
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,645
So, yeah, food is changing,

We all believe that

797
