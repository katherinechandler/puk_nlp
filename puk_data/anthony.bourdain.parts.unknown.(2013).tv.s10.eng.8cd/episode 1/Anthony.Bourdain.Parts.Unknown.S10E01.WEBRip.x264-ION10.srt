Yeah, everything's in camera.

00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,486
It's very important everywhere.

184
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,188
We have to follow the laws
of negligence.

185
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,760
That's the reason Singapore
is very good.

As human beings, what we need...

189
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,832
Food to eat, clothes to wear,

190
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,900
place to sleep.

191
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,001
You can get in Singapore.

192
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,202
So, in other words,

193
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,770
we have to continue work.

194
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,339
You working, you get something.
Once lazy, we're out.

195
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,009
By some measures,
Singapore is a welfare state,

196
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,877
taking care of the less
fortunate.

197
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,546
But at its heart,
it's a cold-blooded meritocracy.

198
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,849
You follow the rules
(and there are many),

199
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,418
work hard, and you will
have a good life.

200
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,020

202

We are starting to define
the definition of success.

I mean, before, we are very
clear with the five C's:

car, condominium, a credit card,

205

Wow, that sounds awful, dude.

That's the past, I think.

Wow.
We're having lontong:

220
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:11,011
rice cake, coconut gravy,
vegetables and a hardboiled egg.

221
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,580

with chili paste, prawns,
bean sprouts,

fried bean curd, and an egg.

- Mmm.
- Delicious.

I mean, we like to make fun
of Singapore in the West...

227

Call it Disneyland with
the death penalty.

228

of course, of one-party rule.

Can't do.

- Can't do.
- Yeah, you can't, yeah.

00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,646
Do you think that young,
creative Singaporeans

233
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,817
feel those constraints
and suffer from them?

234
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,519
I think some of them
who travel knows better.

235
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,689
Most of them are overeducated
and under-exposed,

236
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,725
meaning they are... they have
very little experience

237
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,126
in what they know.

238
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,420
And I think that's
what we are lacking.

239
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,029
They are looking
for things to do.

240
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,231
And the problem with this
is always that we're living

241
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,700
in a small country,
and we have nowhere to go

242
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,535
and where to experience
these things.

243
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,904
If you're in New York and you
don't like the city life,

244
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,498
you say, "Shit, I'm..."
You say, "I'm not gonna..."

245
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,807
You can say "shit" on the show.

246
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,308
I'm gonna say this.

247
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,602
I think we have two more
on this hour.

248
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,145
That was one.

249
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,539
"I'm going to get
out of the city."

250
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,148
So you go to Minnesota,
you go to Texas.

251
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,682
- Right.
- You take time to think about.

252
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,610
And even in Malaysia, when you
are in Kuala Lumpur,

253
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,847
and you go to, like... you go to
Terengganu, you go to Kuantan.

254
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,889
We have nowhere to go.

255
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,927
Not only is Singapore
a small city-state

256
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,064
a little more than half
the size of LA,

257
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,199
but there's also a pressure
of a kind

258
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,902
from a Big Brother government
who's always watching,

259
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,637
however benevolently
one might think.

260
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,543
Every day as an entertainer,

261
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,280
as a producer and director,
we are reminded what not to do.

262
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,949
Don't insult other races.
Don't insult other religion.

263
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,752
There are some parameters that
we always need to stick by.

264
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:00,353
- Right.
- I think, as a creative person,

265
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,714
I think we are always
trying to work out.

266
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,957
And I think that's
challenging for us,

267
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,293
and again, most of the things
that I do on television

268
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,387
is funded by the government.

269
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,796
So, you know, so what...

270
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,630
You're biting the hand
that feeds you.

271
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,401
But our job is basically,
as entertainer,

272
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,403
just to purely entertain.

273
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,372
And we know there a line
that we can't cross.

274
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,609
Religion, our ancestors,
our parents.

275
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,544
You know, things like that.
So it's...

276
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,806

Uh, if your own parent,
it's okay.

How about your, I mean,
family member...

280
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,386
Yeah, but I get high marks
when they... you know,

281
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,755
they can give you a twist
to a story of a mother-in-law.

282
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,891
Right. Oh, mother-in-law's
okay.

283
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,426
Yeah, mother-in-law's okay.

284
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,187
Why does a mother-in-law
always get the joke?

285
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,595

"Is there another way of life?"

295
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,743
You know, I think that's the big
kind of Singapore dilemma,

296
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,619
in a way.
So is there angst?

297
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,354
- Yeah.
- Is there angst?

298
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,123
- It's angst.
- But I think there's no...

299

like going online,

anonymous about it.

302
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:52,032
Even online, they have
paid the price for it.

303
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,902
People have been let go
of their jobs,

304
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:58,571
and that... that's the price
that we have to pay.

305
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,142
The price may seem pretty high
by American standards:

306
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,178
no political dissent,
no right to assembly,

307
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,413
a restricted press,

308
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,748
and limited freedom of speech.

319
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,944
I think one of the issues
is that

320
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,512
we're kind of a victim of our
own success in many ways.

321
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,715
We've grown so fast,
and I guess expectations

322
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,718
among the liberals
and progressives

323
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:49,389
have just so far ahead,
including myself,

324
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,958
that sometimes, you know, we...

325
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:54,194
We need a reality check
about what society...

326
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,296
What pace society can move at.

327
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,131
So I think that's
a tension, is that

328
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,367
economic growth has
happened so quickly.

329
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,469
- Yeah.
- And sometimes social mores,

330
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,972
social customs, might take
a bit more time.

331
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,475
You know, a place where
everything works this well...

332
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,479
And a system so seemingly
different than...

333
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,915
Than we are taught to venerate.

334
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:19,619
Uh, that's genuinely confusing.

335
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,754
So what's the best thing
about Singapore,

336
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,856
and what's the worst thing
about Singapore?

337
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:28,962
I think best things
are tolerance

338
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,730
and efficiency.

339
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,333
But you know, if you just
look around us right now, right,

340
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,734
you know, there's like...

341
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,336
There's like a mosque
over there.

342
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,005
There's a Buddhist temple
over there.

343
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,907
There're like a bunch
of brothels over there.

344
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,076
Prostitutes walking the street,
legally.

345
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,744
They're regulated
by the government.

346
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,847
And everybody has
kind of accepted this...

347
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,317
This quid-pro-quo situation.

348
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,851
Um, and it somehow works.

349
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,786
Okay, you were shaking
your head, though,

350
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,522
on something he was saying.

351
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,859
No, I... I agree, but to be
feeling so secure

352
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,528

Okay.

369

parity for women

370
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,900
and you are paid and treated
as well as men?

371
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,835
- Yes.
- Yes, I think so.

372
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,404
- Yes.
- You know why?

373
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,706
I think that's because of maids.

374
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,242
- What are maids?
- Maids, as in helpers.

375
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,810
- Maids.
- Helpers.

376
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,812
I think you'll find
I actually...

377
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,715
If you look at Singapore, a lot
of women in the workforce.

378
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,584
And the reason why that is so
is because

379
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,086
everybody's got a maid

380
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,920
looking after their
child at home.

381
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,523
So maids are kind of like
the opiate of the masses.

382
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,925
But an opiate gives you

383
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,894
slothful and laying home...
Exactly!

384
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,230
Exactly.
But if you have a maid,

385
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,332
you're saying it frees you up
to join the workforce.

386
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,367
It frees you up,
but it also means that I...

387
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,604
My husband now, he doesn't know
how to serve himself water.

388
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,273
- Yeah.
- He goes, he goes...

389
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,109
"Eh, water."
Like that.

390
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,411
- Laundry?
- Sorry?

391
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,179

- No.

We're now living in times
where globalism

533
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,636
and globalization are bad words.

534
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,704
- Yeah, I know.
- We're seeing a rise of...

535
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:33,873
- Populism.
- Of populism, of nationalism.

536
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,542
Which is why, you know,

537
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:38,177
I'm worried about... concerned
about Singapore's future.

540
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,342
And as the world turns
against globalization,

541
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,618
as the world becomes
more inward-looking,

542

544
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,125
literally in the case
of the U.S...

545
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,162
- Right.
- There is a high probability

546
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:59,566

often accused of being
extremely keen

558
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,977
Of course, the most powerful
instrument of social engineering

559
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,219

560
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,921

uniform housing estates.

engineering
