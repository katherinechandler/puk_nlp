00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:07,341
In September, 2017,
Hurricane Maria devastated

2
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:09,843
the American island
of Puerto Rico.

3
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:13,214
At the time of this writing
12 days after the hurricane,

4
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,716
almost 95% of the island's
residents

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,351
are still without power,

6
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:20,688
and close to half don't have
clean water.

7
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,690
Just months prior, we shot an
episode there

8
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,526
hoping to capture the
staggering economic crisis

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,362
that Puerto Ricans were
already dealing with.

10
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,764
So now we have to ask ourselves,

11
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,101
can the island ever rebuild,

12
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:36,204
and what is our responsibility
as Americans

13
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:39,073
in making that a reality?

What is Puerto Rico?

It's not a state.

86
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,312
It's kind of like a colony,
but it's not.

87
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,079
It's not kind.
It is.

88
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,448
It is a colony.

89
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,417
It's an unincorporated
territory.

90
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,984
"Unincorporated territory."

91
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

92
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,922
So, you know, what's that?
What is that?

93
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,925
We're still trying to
figure out sometimes, you know?

94
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,727
Would you say the majority
of Puerto Ricans

95
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,762
consider themselves Americans?

96
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,790
Or do they consider themselves
Puerto Ricans or both?

97
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,133
I think that they
consider theirself Puerto Ricans

98
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,670
with the privilege of having
the United States citizenship.

99
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,772
Yeah, but it's kind of
a half-ass citizenship.

100
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:32,940
Can't vote for president.

101
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,241

- Or Congress.
- Anything.

103
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,910
You don't really have much voice

104
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,346
in your own destiny.

105
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,013
Exactly.
You can only go to war.

106
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,949
That's the only thing
that you can do with right.

107
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:47,020
Right. But Puerto Rico owes,
what, $75 billion right now?

108
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,856
- 72, yeah.
- 72.

109
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,190
I don't see statehood.

110
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,192
I don't see Congress or Senate
ever...

111
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,594
Me neither.

112
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,197
Ever taking on
a $72 billion debt load,

113
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,132
especially for a lot of people
who speak Spanish.

114
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,434
Exactly.

115
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,169
What's the way out of this?

116
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,472
Oh, my God.

117
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,106
What about tourism?

118
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,975
It's an industry of services

119
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,544
to service the wealthy.

120
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,146
And then at the same time,
you take $450 million

121
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,815
out of the university,
for example,

122
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,551
so you're gonna have
less educated people

123
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:20,220
willing to do any type
of work...

124
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,855
To survive.

125
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,324
You are not really
producing an economy

126
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:27,327
that a person can survive in,
you know?

127
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,797
This is a country
where people live,

128
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,298
where we do things.

129
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,502
And we have culture
and literature and music

130
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,970
and produce intellectual,
important work.

131
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:41,074
They are selling us
as only a good resort

132
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:45,579
to have a piña colada
in the beach and that's it.

133
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:48,181
We actually invented
piña coladas, so...

134
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:57,858
Even though we are, like,
getting over by...

135
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,528
- Vultures.
- Yeah, a lot of vultures.

136
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,096
The people of Puerto Rico
are good people,

137
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,635
and I think that we are gonna
get past this.

138
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:17,077
The situation here
is truly grave.

139
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,880
So how exactly did Puerto Rico
find itself

140
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:24,051
so deeply and seemingly
irrevocably screwed?

141
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,721
In the early '70s,

142
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,590
things were looking
pretty good for Puerto Rico.

143
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,725
A tax incentive was introduced,

144
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,728
which helped lure dozens of
major companies to the island,

145
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,731
employing significant numbers
of people.

146
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,437
But when that incentive
expired in 2006,

147
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:46,039
concurrent with a major
recession in the States,

148
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,142
those companies packed up
and left.

149
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,244
Thousands of Puerto Ricans
followed,

150
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:56,884
looking for jobs that no
longer existed on the island.

151
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,453
The tax base shrunk drastically,

152
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:01,455
creating a dire need for cash

153
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:04,758
to shore up basic needs
and services.

154
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,928
So along came
the municipal bond,

155
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:12,666
a big, fat IOU
that appeared to be salvation

156
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,902
for a near-broke government.

157
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:19,473
They're sexy for investors,
triple exempt from taxes,

158
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,075
and bond owners
buying Puerto Rican debt

159
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:27,948
would have to be paid back
before anyone.

160
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,416
That's anyone.

161
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,519
Hedge funds, or vulture funds,

162
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,954
as they are often referred to
in these cases,

163
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,790
had profited from
similarly desperate situations

164
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,960
in Greece, Argentina,
and Detroit.

165
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,496
As the situation worsened
for Puerto Rico,

166
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,297
you could buy up
more and more bonds

167
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,033
for pennies on the dollar.

168
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:50,904
This was a fire sale
too sweet to pass up.

169
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,375
And the resulting
insurmountable debt,

170
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,445
it means drastic
austerity measures

171
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,313
determined by an unelected board

172
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,884
who have near absolute power
to raise taxes;

173
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,886
empty teachers' pension plans;

174
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,789
close down schools, hospitals;

175
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,625
basically squeeze every dollar
out of Puerto Rico

176
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,794
to pay back the funds.

177
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,832
Every Puerto Rican is being
made to feel the pain.

178
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,170
I mean, I know
schools are closing, yes?

179
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,072
Last year, 240 schools closed.

180
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,721
- Last year alone.
- In the last two years.

181
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,709
This year, there's a list
of 300 schools

182
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,645
that are "in risk"
of shutting down.

183
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,180
Born in Puerto Rico?

184
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,240
I was born in Chicago, Illinois.

185
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,248
In Chicago.

186
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,516
My family came back

187
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,686
mostly because
our family was here.

188
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,421
Puerto Ricans want the family
to stick together.

189
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,757
If you can live
close to each other,

190
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,925
the better.

191
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,326
I decided to stay,

192
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,896
because I wanted my kids
to grow up here.

193
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,163
Better times.

194
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,198
Better times, of course.

195
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,532
What changed?

196
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,702
The government took
too much in loans

197
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,503
and couldn't pay them back.

198
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,873
So they kept putting taxes
on the people,

199
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:02,009
the working-class people
like me,

200
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,377
and we cannot pay them.

201
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,079
Like many professionals here,

202
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,548
Liza-Marie Cordova
would probably have

203
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,684
an easier time of it
in the States.

204
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,586
But she chooses to stay.

205
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,187
With the crisis
here in Puerto Rico,

206
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,124
mostly I think about my kids.

207
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,260
Will they have the options
to stay here

208
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:24,665
and work and have a family?

209
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,604
Okay, so where are we?

210
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,773
We are at Casa Vieja in Ciales.

211
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:37,410
This is a typical 1960, '50
grandmother's house.

212
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,714
And the food is grandma food?

213
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:43,383
It is grandma food, actually.

214
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,786
Those are corn fritters
with ham.

215
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,255
Typical Sunday
after Saturday party.

216
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,489
Hangover food.

217
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,590
Delicious.

218
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,459
Thank you.

219
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,261
So this is like a plantain soup.

220
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,896
Mmm.
Ooh, that's good.

221
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,598
The specialty here
is pastel al caldero,

222
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,134
pork marinated in bitter orange,

223
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:05,005
taro root, green plantains,
squash,

224
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,575
and garbanzo beans slow cooked.

225
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,279
And morcilla, blood sausage,

226
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,915
one of my favorite things.

227
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,616
Is good?

228
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,852
It's fantastic.

229
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:22,856
Teachers here are being asked
to pay into a pension system

230
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,993
that has been described
as a Ponzi scheme.

231
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,129
You pay 10% of your income
into your pension plan

232
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,630
out of every paycheck.

233
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,818
The money you're paying in now

234
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,600
is being used to pay...

235
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,057
The ones that are retired
right now.

236
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,770
The ones who are
retiring right now:

237
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,806
in a pyramid scheme,
the top of the pyramid.

238
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,373
But by the time
it gets down to you,

239
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,776
who've been paying in
for your entire life...

240
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,277
There's no money left.

241
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,679
I worry about my future.

242
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:47,815
I don't know
what I'm gonna live off.

243
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:51,151
I have two jobs
in order to pay my bills,

244
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,221
have my car, have my house,
pay for my kids' education.

245
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,655
Right.

246
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,150
There's no way,
with one job as a teacher,

247
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,225
I can do that.

248
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,727
So how do you continue?

249
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,562
I know I could get paid triple
in the States.

250
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,631
But I don't want
to give up my country.

251
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,500
My kids see
how their parents struggle.

252
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:10,503
Things can change
if only one stands up

253
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,172
and decides,
"I'm gonna do this."

254
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,506
Right.

255
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,035
But we have to empower
those children.

256
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,011
We have to make them believe
they can change it,

257
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,679
that there's a better life
for them.

258
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,081
And I'm getting emotional,

259
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:25,252
because sometimes I feel
that I've failed.

260
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,520
I cannot save all of them.

261
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,156
That's the truth.

262
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,059
But I can save a lot,

263
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,693
and that's my job.

264
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,829
So that's what I'm going to do.

265
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,230
I have hope.
I have faith.

266
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,767
I'm taking a jump of faith.

267
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:55,949

holy week before Easter,

raise pigs here, no problem.

to work in a bank
or some big companies,

355
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:32,025
they're going back
to the countryside, you know?

356
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,461

00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,331
So there's hope.

360
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,501
Yeah, humbly, I can say
me and my family are an example

361
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:47,174
of what you can do
with the tools you got.

362
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,976
- Well said, man.
- Yeah.

363
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,411
These are delicious.

364
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,679
- You can squeeze...
- Yeah.

365
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,247
A little like that.

366
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,015
Yeah, believe me.
That used to be my job.

367
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,185
I used to have to squeeze
all the lobster legs

368
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,486
with a rolling pin.

369
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,221
Oh!

370
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:14,167
Puerto Rico is still
unarguably rich in one thing:

371
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,069
natural splendor.

372
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:21,341
Beautiful views.

373
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,377
Unspoiled coastline.

374
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:27,714
But that, too, is in peril.

375
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,549
My name is Pocho.

376
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,852
I was born and raised
in Aguadilla.

377
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,855
This space is so special
to me personally,

378
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,424
because, yes, I'm a surfer,

379
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,392
and I've been surfing here
all my life.

380
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:43,230
I want my son to be able
to keep coming here.

381
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,699
It's so open,

382
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,470
so free
of all of these pollutions,

383
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,005
all this mayhem.

384
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,283
Pocho and his fellow activists

385
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,051
have occupied Playuela,

386
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,753
trying to serve as human shields

387
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,556
against the encroachment
of a planned development

388
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,259
that would transform this
place into a massive resort

389
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,128
named, appropriately
or inappropriately enough,

390
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,497
after Christopher Columbus.

391
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,100
This is a resistant town.

392
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,769
Just a hypothetical question.

393
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,297
If the beach is public,
what's the problem?

394
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,905
The project.

395
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,241
It's not a building;
it's a megaproject.

396
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:32,312
It's a five-star hotel,
120 villas, a mini mall.

397
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,980
"The biggest casino
in the Caribbean"...

398
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,348
That's how they sell it.

399
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,917
And two parking lots
four stories high.

400
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,519
We're talking, like,
poof, poof, poof,

401
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,988
poof, poof, poof, poof,
poof... you know?

402
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,423
It's not sustainable.

403
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,192
If they roll in
the bulldozers right now

404
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,719
with a whole bunch of police,
what do you do?

405
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,127
Civil disobedience.

406
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,596
We go stop
in front of the machines,

407
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,798
and we'll give them time
for the lawyers

408
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:52,825
to do their case in the court

409
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,033
and whatnot and whatnot.

410
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,302
Oh, you got some lawyers here.

411
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,803
Yeah, I got all the lawyers.

412
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,038
- Lawyers go to the beach?
- Yes, man, hey.

413
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,842
The chef is making sancocho,

414
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,046
the stew of beef, veal,
and sausages.

415
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,818
And there's
some fresh-caught grouper

416
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,753
and red snapper.

417
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:23,330
There aren't many places left
like this; that's the point.

418
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,198
That's worth something.
Yeah, exactly.

419
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,659
The tourism business
in the Caribbean

420
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,668
is going through
a lot of changes.

421
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,171
In the short term,
developers and construction

422
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,073
get paid a lot of money
for pouring concrete.

423
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,509
But everybody's gonna be going
to Cuba in a few years.

424
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,177
Why?
Because it's unspoiled.

425
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,912
They haven't [...] it up yet.

426
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,549
So that's why we have to start
talking the same language.

427
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,750
You said it, profit.

428
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,151
They talk profit, right?

429
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,019
Let's show them
that there is profit

430
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,355
is nature unspoiled.

431
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,857
That reef back there provides us

432
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,526
with millions of dollars' worth
of services:

433
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,664
fish, tourism, protection
from hurricanes annually.

434
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,367
That produces a service to us
as a community.

435
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,001
So if you all of a sudden
destroy it,

436
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,536
you start losing money.

437
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,540
Could you conceivably settle
for a revised project,

438
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,610
meaning, okay, no casino,
no giant hotel?

439
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,513
An eco lodge
for super-rich people.

440
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,715
In Nicaragua, they have
a lot of these things

441
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,717
that are developed
around communities.

442
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,919
Costa Rica, you know,
and places like that, you know,

443
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,022
the government is conscious
about the environment

444
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,557
and the amount of money

445
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,051
that that environment
and the ecosystem brings

446
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,560
to the economy.

447
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,289
Do you have any faith
in your government at all?

448
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:30,297
- No.
- No.

449
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,598
We are a colony.

450
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,533
We are an island
surrounded by water,

451
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,536
and we don't produce
almost, like, 90%

452
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,104
of the things we consume,

453
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,639
which makes us needy.

454
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,742
It makes us
a third-world country.

455
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,111
Third-world country
which belongs

456
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,246
to the most powerful nation.

457
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,648

It's not about independence
or not.

It's about what is right,
what the people needs.

461

It's coming out of
the comfort shell

462
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,160
and realizing that if you
don't do anything right now,

463
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,795
we're just gonna get run over.

464

00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,226
that have been largely
forgotten.

537
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,729
When you go to another place
and they tell you,

538
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:58,898
"Yeah, yeah,
I went to McDonald's

539
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,633
when I went to Puerto Rico,"
that sucks.

540
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,368
I hate that,

541
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,638
because we have a lot
of really good stuff here,

542
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,541
and it's our job
to keep it alive

543
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:10,877
and show it to the world
and say,

544
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,614
"Hey, we are more
than a fast food."

545
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:18,250
We got to go back to farming.

546
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,345
'Cause you don't want to be
buying everything from imports.

547
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,688
Of course.

548
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,355
In my restaurant,
I started six years ago

549
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,857
with just two farmers.

550
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,226
Now we have more than
15, 16 farmers.

551
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,661
It's like a chain.

552
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,496
You go to many farmers,
and you ask, like,

553
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,557
"This type
of root vegetable."

554
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,165
And they don't have it,

555
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,868
because people stopped buying
the local root vegetable,

556
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,838
because the imported one
is a whole lot cheaper,

557
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,539
and that's all they have
in their mind.

558
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:43,109
But if you go to a farmer
and you tell the farmer,

559
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,777
"I'm gonna buy your product,"

560
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:47,446
the farmer is gonna start
having the product.

561
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,741
"Pay more" is a hard argument
to make

562
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:50,082
when people are struggling.

563
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,851
But if we don't change
our mind, Tony,

564
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,613
I don't know what's gonna happen
with the island.

565
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,087
Do people listen if you say,

566
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,589
"Look, it's not
particularly patriotic;

567
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:58,190
"you're not helping your country

568
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,985
by eating at McDonald's
or shopping at Walmart"?

569
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,628
Uh, yes.

570
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:03,129
Yeah?

571
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,797
But like I tell you, Tony,

572
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,199
we have a lot of different types
of Puerto Ricans.

573
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,469
We have Puerto Rican that,
"Yes, I love my island,"

574
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,071
but they don't think more ahead.

575
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,373
They simply think,
"I'm happy with what I have."

576
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,708
The other type of Puerto Rican,

577
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,409
they know
that it's gonna be hard,

578
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,613
but they want to grow,
want to keep learning,

579
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:22,081
want to stay here,

580
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,816
want to develop what they have
in the island.

581
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,110
This is a good argument
for it, man.

582
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,152
This is incredible.

583
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,286
Yeah, yeah.

584
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,821
Could eat this all day.

585
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,354
In the "life doesn't suck"
department,

586
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,123
this is way up there,

587
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:08,695
a means of conveyance
I find quite comfortable.

588
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:15,634
Barefoot and a bit drunk,
pleasantly burned by the sun,

589
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:18,004
lunch approaches.

590
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:25,044
If you need any prep done,
any knife work,

591
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,345
just let me know.

592
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,980
Got to put some avocado
in there.

593
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,849
- Got to have it.
- Yeah.

594
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,221
First time using a knife?

595
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,856
Well, it's been a while.

596
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,194
You got talent.

597
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:43,730
Yeah, if this TV thing
falls through,

598
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,331
I can always work at Denny's.

599
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,169
Man, looking great.

600
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,338
All these dishes are
traditional Holy Friday food.

601
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:56,242
This one is salted cod
marinated in coconut milk.

602
00:27:56,275 --> 00:28:00,546
And then we seared it
with some root vegetables.

603
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,749
And boiled eggs
from our farmers.

604
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:03,776
Here we have the...
Escabeche.

605
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:05,351
Escabeche, yeah.

606
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,879
So, like, five fish
marinated or pickled.

607
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:09,421
It's fried local mackerel,

608
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:10,716
and then I roast
all the vegetable

609
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,424
and cure it for at least a week.

610
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,861
Oh, the salt dish is good.

611
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:17,096
Coconut milk really takes
that salty...

612
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,497
Mm-hmm.

613
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,999
Damn, who made
that avocado salad?

614
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,533
It's awesome.
No, the chef is awesome.

615
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,736
Eh, I don't know.

616
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,891
Vieques is officially within

617
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,726
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,

618
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,764
the main island
a mere eight miles away.

619
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,466
It is phenomenally peaceful
here,

620
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,970
but it hasn't always been
that way.

621
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,074
For over 60 years,

622
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,043
the island was used
as a bombing range

623
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,246
for the U.S. Navy
and for training exercises.

624
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,416
The soil is rich
with depleted uranium,

625
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,085
Agent Orange, and the kind of
good stuff left over

626
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,088
after 60 years of explosives
raining down on it.

627
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:19,458
Many see a clear connection
between that recent history

628
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,928
and a cancer rate
that is 30% higher

629
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,096
than the rest of Puerto Rico.

630
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,565
While the navy works
to clean up what it left,

631
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,435
Vieques tries to deal
with the financial crisis

632
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,804
in its own ways.

633
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,308
Chef Erica Boulogne grew up here

634
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:38,610
and has raised her family here.

635
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,449
♪

636
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,952
She invited me
to a meal in her home.

637
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:48,287
Joining us are her mother
and son, Carlitos,

638
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,191
her two nieces,
and her best friend, Elda.

639
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,626
Now, where was
the bombing range?

640
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,028
Pretty close here.

641
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:58,630
Two miles after this,
maybe less.

642
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,132
This was part of the navy land.

643
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,801
When did the navy stop
using Vieques

644
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:03,870
as a bombing range?

645
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,171
- 2003.
- 2003.

646
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,306
Oh, that's not that long ago.

647
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:10,009
So you'd be eating lunch,
and you'd hear, "Boom, boom"?

648
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,343
- Basically.
- Yes.

649
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,611
Yeah, sometimes.

650
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,980
And still they detonate bombs.

651
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:15,982
This is leftover ordnance.

652
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:18,017
Yeah, this is, like,
the cleanup process.

653
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,286
They gather
the unexploded munitions,

654
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,121
and then they detonate them
all together.

655
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,123
And the house move
with the bombing.

656
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,125
It's like the middle of the war.

657
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,060
Adam, so you've lived here
for how long?

658
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:29,361
- All my life.
- Me too.

659
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,997
All my life in Vieques.

660
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,500
I've been drinking
a fair amount of this lately.

661
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:36,835
This one is flavored with...

662
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:38,504
- Acerola.
- Acerola.

663
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:39,872
All right, who's joining me?

664
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,573
Adults only.

665
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:43,675
- Salut.
- Salut.

666
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,511
Mmm, good.

667
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,880
I'm not driving after this.

668
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,483
Lobsters

669
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:55,421
with mashed yautia
and yuca from the garden,

670
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:58,057
conch salad, and coconut arepa.

671
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,992
It's really beautiful here.

672
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:04,263
This is not San Juan;
this is much more lush and...

673
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:07,033
- Light, no fast food.
- Born and raised in paradise.

674
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:10,036
Beautiful beaches,
awesome sunsets.

675
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,171
The whole world wants
what you have already.

676
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,739
How's the economy here?

677
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,076
Bankruptcy.

678
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,111
We are like the colony
of a colony.

679
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:22,214
Basically, the biggest employer
is the municipal government.

680
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:23,382
Wait a minute.

681
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,584
The number one employer
on Vieques

682
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:26,852
is the government.

683
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,220
Yes, the municipal government.

684
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,455
- The local government.
- Yeah.

685
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,889
We also have this dynamic

686
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,859
that people that study
and make a profession,

687
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,695
10% come back,
and that's a high number.

688
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,264
There's no jobs for them.

689
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,732
So our population
is getting older,

690
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,568
and it's formed
by retired people.

691
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,802
Right.
Where they going?

692
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:46,272
Main island or United States.

693
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:48,774
What's the plan
when you guys grow up?

694
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:49,775
What do you want to do?

695
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,110
I want to be a chef.

696
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,311
A chef?

697
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:55,281
Good for you.
That's hard.

698
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,416
Your dream restaurant,
where would it be?

699
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,385
- The main island.
- You see?

700
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:03,589
Yeah, so in 20 years...

701
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,923
It's scary.

702
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:06,492
Who's gonna live...

703
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,727
- Not our kids.
- Who will own Vieques?

704
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,162
I mean, who will be in charge?

705
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:13,099
Not locals.
Not people that studied here.

706
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,601
The land is too expensive
for the local people.

707
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:19,605
So this'll be vacation homes
for wealthy people

708
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:20,906
from other countries.

709
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,341
- Yeah, yeah.
- Basically.

710
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,776
- Yeah.
- Who will save Puerto Rico?

711
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,278
Who will save Vieques?

712
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:27,846
It ain't gonna be
Big Daddy America.

713
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,116
- It's ourselves.
- But how?

714
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,617
How?
I don't know.

715
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,985
I don't know how.

716
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,040
Life on Vieques offers
the kind of freedom,

717
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,841
the kind of beautiful views

718
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:59,145
that have largely disappeared
in the developed world.

719
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:02,781
But life can be difficult.

720
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,617
There is little agriculture
or economy

721
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,653
to sustain the people
who live here.

722
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,393
At one of the highest spots
in Vieques,

723
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,463
the sea visible in the distance,

724
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:21,667
is Finca Conciencia,
a small but sustainable farm

725
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,869
founded by Jorge Cora Peña,

726
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:26,372
intent on providing locals
and area restaurants

727
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:30,909
with fruits, vegetables,
honey, and medicinal herbs.

728
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:40,486
My name
is Ana Elisa Pérez Quintero.

729
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,022
I live and work
in La Finca Conciencia.

730
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:47,659
We run a productive
and educational

731
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,828
agricultural project.

732
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,430
We farm.

733
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:54,200
We have the land
and the resources

734
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:57,836
to produce food that is
economically viable,

735
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,541
that is self-sustaining
without a lot of investment.

736
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,376
It's liberating.

737
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:20,058
Jorge cooks lunch.

738
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,537
Mero, or grouper,

739
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,606
stuffed with lobster
and white eggplant...

740
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:41,580
Wrapped in banana leaves
and grilled over mesquite.

741
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:45,751
Mangu is mashed plantains
with sofrito.

742
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,556
All right.
That looks good.

743
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,759
And what's this here?
And that's pitorro.

744
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,754
Oh, I know what that is.
I'll have a shot of that.

745
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,397
Actually, we call it
"lágrima de monte,"

746
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,432
like, "teardrop
of the mountain."

747
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:02,268
Will I be crying afterwards?

748
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,269
Maybe.

749
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:05,070
It's very intense.

750
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,772
- Salut.
- Salut.

751
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,010
How long have you had this farm?

752
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,579
How long have you been
doing this?

753
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,748
Jorge started the farm
around ten years now,

754
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,685
but the farm was originally
part of the area

755
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:20,852
that the navy took.

756
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,321
Oh, yeah.

757
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:23,948
And so it's part
of the rescues that happened

758
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,292
throughout the '80s, '90s.

759
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,093
Farming is difficult work.

760
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,495
- Yeah.
- So why?

761
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,330
My mom would ask
the same question.

762
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,098
She was like,
"What are you doing?

763
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,301
Are you quitting your job
that"...

764
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,869
In Puerto Rico, it's really hard
to find a good job.

765
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:40,972
But I think that farming
is the most practical thing

766
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:44,510
that we can do
in the midst of a crisis.

767
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,004
It is something
that is gonna create work.

768
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,646
It's gonna help the economy.

769
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,980
It's a blunt question,

770
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,982
but can you make money farming?

771
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,618
In Puerto Rico,
it's still a challenge,

772
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,286
because, obviously,
we get a lot of food

773
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,722
that's super subsidized
from the U.S.

774
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,690
But there are people
who are our neighbors

775
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,659
are like, "I'll pay more."

776
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,328
Like, how much is it worth,
you know?

777
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,829
People really value the work

778
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,997
when they see
that we're working for it.

779
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,165
It's part of a statement.

780
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,834
It's part of educating people.

781
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:11,737
Since our generation,
supermarket, supermarket.

782
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,307
We were consciously stripped
away from farming.

783
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,175
People were forced
out of the country

784
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:18,644
to be able to work

785
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,712
in all of these maquiladoras
and everything.

786
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:24,082
Kids here were
completely disconnected from...

787
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,052
And my generation...
From where things grow.

788
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,488
Like, we do an exercise
with local schools,

789
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:33,259
and kids here draw a plantain
growing like a lettuce.

790
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,427
I mean, the last thing
in the world the States wants

791
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,829
is for Puerto Rico to become
sustainable,

792
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,232
because it means you're gonna
buy less stuff.

793
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,434
Less snacks, less Pepsi,

794
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:43,702
less American products.

795
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,036
We don't like that.

796
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,072
If we don't have
our own food supply,

797
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:49,608
we can't even think about
really being able

00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:38,236
We have been taught
that we can't do it.

889
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,838
We are preconditioned to think

890
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:43,108
that we need that support
of the U.S.

891
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,143
If we decide to be
an independent country,

892
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,413
we have to go through a process
of being on our own,

893
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,482
and we have never done that.

894
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:51,610
We have to start from scratch.

895
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,118
We don't have agriculture.

896
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,621
We don't have any economic...
Production.

897
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,088
Production, anything.

898
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,456
It's gonna be tough,

899
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,018
and I hope that we can fight
for ourselves

900
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:05,296
to inspire people,
to give them strength to resist.

901
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,966
Obviously, music is good
for that.
