00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:42,694
In the county itself,
as of the last census, so.

178
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,696
Those are some grim statistics.

179
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:46,456
Yes, yes.

180
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:50,012
The coal that came out of
this area built America, right?

181
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,185
Yes.

182
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,490
McDowell County alone was called

183
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:54,016
a billion-dollar coal field,

184
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,226
and the people that were
in charge at the time

185
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,918
didn't take advantage
of all that money

186
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:02,472
in case something did happen
to the coal mine.

187
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:04,854
The cool thing is that West
Virginia's developing

188
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,961
a strong entrepreneur movement

189
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:09,928
that a lot of people
don't know about.

190
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:12,448
Like with Joe, he started
a hydroponic growing.

191
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:14,726
I mean, not blaming others
for their problems,

192
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,486
just trying to solve their own.

193
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:19,420
A lot of people that's
really doing a lot of good

194
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:21,491

195
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:22,907
This is our pumpkin pie cake.

196
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:24,633
Have you ever had
a pumpkin pie cake?

197
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:27,394
You probably won't like it,
so we'll take your spot.

198
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:32,951
We got spoiled. The last
coal mines I worked at, I made-

199
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:36,299
base salary was $94,000 a year.

200
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:38,060
I also taught vocational school,

201
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:39,751
and most of the kids
that I had said,

202
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:40,959
"Well, I don't need this.

203
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,271
I'm gonna go in the coal
mines."

204
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:44,169
There's just
an education piece there

205
00:09:44,204 --> 00:09:46,344
now that we're trying to
instill in some of the people

206
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,658
that still have that mentality
that coal was king,

207
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,660
and, you know,
we don't doubt that,

208
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:55,525
but we try to think outside the
box and look at some other...

209
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,149
Some other opportunities
that might be there.

210

The job that I have right now

211
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:04,534

the best jobs around here

that there's not
a lot of resources here,

Like, we did a few community
outreach programs this summer.

is gonna go for them,

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,520
and as a team in here
relying on each other,

are out of this world.

00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:24,977
We just thank you for this day,

704
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:26,213
and most of all,
we just thank you

705
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,462
for the liberties and freedoms

706
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:29,361
that our country provides

707
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:30,362
and you have provided.

708
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:32,364
- Amen.
- Amen.

709
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:34,366
So everybody born
and bred here, or...

710
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,782
- Lisa's from California.
- Mm-hmm.

711
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:38,501
So when you came here,
that was the first time

712
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:39,743
you shot a gun, wasn't it?
Yeah.

713
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,994
Show him your arm.

714
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:44,479
Yeah, show him your tat.
She got an AK tat.

715
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:46,481
AK tattooed on her arm.

716
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:48,345
I lived in Canada
for a long time.

717
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,037
Stayed in England
for quite a while.

718
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:51,624
Sweden for quite a while.

719
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,695
No matter how long I'm gone,
I always come back.

720
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,904
You can't just load the Jeep up
with a bunch of guns

721
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:58,631
and stay out there
for seven days and, you know...

722
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:00,668
You can't really do
that anywhere else.

723
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:02,007
That's probably one of
the greatest things

724
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:03,498
about West Virginia.

725
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:06,743
You know, we can enjoy
whatever we want to enjoy.

726
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:10,126
I'm not trying to force
my opinions on anybody else.

727
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,059
That being said,
we will defend ours.

728
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:14,647
- Yeah.
- I was guessing.

729
00:33:14,682 --> 00:33:16,235
Yeah.

730
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,926
Look, I grew up
in an environment,

731
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:21,240
you see somebody at the
supermarket carrying a handgun,

732
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:24,726
that would be cause
for red alert.

733
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:27,833
Do you think there can be
common ground between somebody

734
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:30,939
who grew up absolutely
thinking guns are a bad thing?

735
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:32,527
I say no.

736
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:34,177
Okay, you're an honest man,
and I appreciate it.

737
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:35,254
Why do you...

738
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:37,360
I'm a responsible gun owner.

739
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:40,673
Why should I be crippled
in what I'm able to do

740
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,537
as far as protecting my family?

741
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:45,264
Look, I hear you, but there's
a fair number of people

742
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,611
in this world who are just,
you know,

743
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:49,786
too dumb to pour piss
out of a boot.

744
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,754
You know, 90-year-old
drivers in Florida,

745
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:55,343
they still got their license,
but should they be driving?

746
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:57,276
- Right.
- A few years ago,

747
00:33:57,311 --> 00:33:58,795
my father was involved
in a shooting

748
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,969
at his pharmacy
that he works at.

749
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:02,454
A man came in.
He had a weapon.

750
00:34:02,488 --> 00:34:03,696
My dad conceal carries.

751
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:05,077
He has a license
to conceal carry.

752
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:06,596
He drew his weapon and fired.

753
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,805
If they take guns away
from law-abiding citizens,

754
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,187
then it's just gonna be
the criminals that have it.

755
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,087
It should be pointed out...

756
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:18,297
It has to be pointed out,
faced head-on...

757
00:34:18,332 --> 00:34:20,299
That shortly after
we filmed here,

758
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:23,785
a gunman in Las Vegas,
with a perfectly legal weapon,

759
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,548
fired off 1,100 rounds
in ten minutes,

760
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:32,967
wounding 422 people
and killing 58.

761
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:35,418
Shortly after that, 17 students

762
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:37,420
were murdered
in Parkland, Florida,

763
00:34:37,454 --> 00:34:41,009
with a legally purchased
semi-automatic rifle,

764
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:43,805

a West Virginia Democrat:

hard line
on the second amendment,

Military, you know,
I was... I'm a veteran.

00:41:09,812 --> 00:41:13,505
There is a smell in the earth
itself here in West Virginia

896
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,474
that, when I was away,
when I was in the army,

897
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,821
that your soul rots away.

898
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:20,685
It feels like you can't
smell it, or you look up

899

all the way set.

Here it disappears around 4:00.

901
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:29,314
Allen Lardieri is a former
tanker in the U.S. Army

902
00:41:29,348 --> 00:41:33,076
and what he calls
Constitutional Conservative.

903
00:41:33,111 --> 00:41:35,665
He is solidly
pro-Trump Republican,

Mr. Trump's New York City

background and gold-plated

You'll see a lot of parallels
in rural West Virginia

907
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:45,744
that you see
in the inner cities.

908
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:48,229
I see a lot of parallels
to places I've been.

909
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:49,886
School districts

910
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:51,336
- That's right.
- Opioid addiction.

911
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,337
Teenage pregnancy.

912
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:53,752
Food deserts, you know,

913
00:41:53,787 --> 00:41:55,264
where there ain't nothing
but fast food.

914
00:41:55,271 --> 00:41:58,585
Exactly. Okay.
Yeah. Where's our Whole Foods?

915
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:00,172
It's non-existent, sir.

916
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:05,453
Why would West Virginia
overwhelmingly go for a guy,

917
00:42:05,488 --> 00:42:09,078
Donald Trump, who's never
changed a tire in his life,

918
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:11,080
who sits on a gold toilet?

919
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:14,773
Yeah, everybody else
talks around this, whatever.

920
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:16,948
This man talks just like us,

921
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:18,708
like how we talk
to each other in the mines.

922
00:42:18,743 --> 00:42:20,952
It ain't pretty.
It's straight talk.

923
00:42:20,986 --> 00:42:23,126
Well, you know, they say
he tells it like it is.

924
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:25,128
I don't know... I don't
know that that's true.

925
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:26,682
He says outrageous things.

926
00:42:26,716 --> 00:42:28,124
I guess that's refreshing.
Oh, yeah.

927
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:29,401
You know, I gave up
on political saviors

928
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:30,789
a long time ago.

929
00:42:30,824 --> 00:42:32,480
I believe it's naive
to go ahead and say

930
00:42:32,515 --> 00:42:34,337
that I think that there's
gonna be one individual,

931
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,622
especially in government,

932
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:37,382
that's gonna turn
everything around.

933
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,591
Trump can bring change,
and it's very quite simple.

His offensive, incendiary nature

935
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,252
can send a word out
to these assholes...

936
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:48,496

Forgotten when most Americans

stopped going to the forest
for their food,

956

they were never forgotten.

seeing from that?

972
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:43,266
Probably a guy that got
about 2 bucks a pound.

973

is you work with
within your means,

pretty special

from this in a way.

1029
00:46:55,502 --> 00:46:58,229
It created this sort of rush

we all have that in common.

1220
00:56:57,379 --> 00:56:59,657
I wish y'all could
come down here and see us soon,

1221
00:56:59,692 --> 00:57:02,902
and when y'all do,
I hope y'all enjoy it.

1222
00:57:02,936 --> 00:57:06,008
This is America,
and if you can't embrace it,

1223
00:57:06,043 --> 00:57:10,496
no matter how bitterly
and fiercely we may disagree,

1224
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,981
there is no hope for any of us.

1225
00:57:13,015 --> 00:57:15,362
I've been living here 65 years.

1226
00:57:15,397 --> 00:57:17,434
I wouldn't trade it for nothing.

1227
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:19,953
I guess I'll be here
till they cut the lights out.

1228
00:57:19,988 --> 00:57:22,335
Family on three.
One, two, three.

1229
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:24,544
Family!
