00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:18,212
First, the club scene

185
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:20,767

186
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,769
where the first
techno club opened.

187

Wall came down and then
everything moved to the East

188
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:29,741
because there was space,
a lot of industrial places,

189
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:32,641
and music was a meeting point
of the East and West

190
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:35,782
and a meeting point of young
people trying to move together.

191
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:37,715
It just happened in the club.

192
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:40,407
When the Wall came down, it was
our music to come together,

193
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,410
so it's very deeply
in our blood.

194
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,239
Right.

a magnet for artists

501
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:51,602
Bowie was exhausted
and burned out

502

to live and to work.

groundbreaking and new.

505
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:03,027

He wasn't a big name
at the time,

512

but it was a historical point

513
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:25,671
because he came to Berlin
the week after

514
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:27,673
he split with his band.

515
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:30,676
And from I.A.,
he went to Berlin.

516
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,787
He had to regenerate from...

517
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:33,575
Well, I.A. had been
really bad.

518
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,682
I mean, apparently existing
only on cartons of milk...

519
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:37,786
Yeah.

520
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:39,547
And cocaine, I think,

521
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:40,962
and not much else.
Yeah.

522
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:43,585
He essentially came to Berlin,

523
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,622
oddly enough,
given his reputation,

524
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,244
to clean up.
Yeah.

525
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,660
Clearly in really bad health,

526
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:50,730

527
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:52,042
Mm-hmm.

528
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,975
And yet the music
that he made here

529
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:57,323
was very different than anything
he'd done before.

530
00:24:57,357 --> 00:24:59,601
What do you think he found here
that was good for him?

531
00:24:59,636 --> 00:25:02,604
Well, he lived a pretty
low-profile life in Berlin.

532
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:05,883
I have to say that.

533
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,298
He could be anonymous here.

534
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:10,647
Like, everybody admired him,
but nobody talked to him.

535
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:14,271
That's a big advantage.

536
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,928
And a funny thing is

537
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:20,829

visionary pregnancy

541
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,636
Now, back in the early '70s
when David Bowie arrived,

542
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:36,804
a lot of people don't realize,
but Berlin was surrounded.

543
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:39,779
I mean, it was
essentially an island

544
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:40,853
during much of that period.

545
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:42,782
Yes, yeah.

546
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:45,233
Outside of
whatever Bowie was doing,

547
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:46,717
what was... what was it like

548
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,030
in West Berlin at that time?

549
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:51,929
It was like pressure cooking.

550
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:56,209
You know, it was like
pressure cooking.

551
00:25:56,244 --> 00:25:58,764
West Berlin was
surrounded by the Wall

552
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:01,629
and there were just three
roads leading to West Berlin

553
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:04,977
and they were controlled by
the Russians, basically.

554
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:09,809
So why would a walled city

555
00:26:09,844 --> 00:26:12,329
surrounded by hostile forces

556
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:16,333
be such a hothouse
for art, music,

557
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,093
and free expression?

558
00:26:18,128 --> 00:26:20,924
West Berlin was always
very international.

559
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:23,616
We had, like,
people were flying in

560
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:24,997

561
00:26:25,031 --> 00:26:27,620
Artists from all genres
were here,

562

and we were surrounded by East.

563
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,938
The Wall was a solid resistance,

564
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:37,423
and you need a strong enemy to
build a strong muscle.

565
00:26:37,457 --> 00:26:39,805
And people who were living here

566
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,014
had to improvise a lot.

567
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:46,639
It's what is seen by many as,

568
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,676
you know, a golden period.
