1
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:11,078
This is your first
time to Denmark?

2
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,980
I've got to be honest, I
usually try to avoid clean,

3
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,149
orderly countries without
massive social countries.

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,484
If you're not the poster boy for

5
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,286
the entire country,
you should be.

6
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:20,154
We go?

7
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:24,291
Yes, let's go.

8
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,892
You were saddled with the weight

9
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:26,993
of best restaurant in the world.

10
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,629
This looks totally bogus.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,398
It's fantastic.

12
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,399
You have to work 20 hours a

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,767
day in order to achieve this.

14
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,303
They're waiting now.

15
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:36,237
Let's go.

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,840
It's so much mess about... whoo!

17
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,142
It's about bang.

18
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:46,846
And elements, elements.

19
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,515
What places have you been that

20
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:54,487
you can compare to Noma?

21
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:54,822
No place.

22
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:55,423
It's a whole different world.

23
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:56,423
Beautiful!

24
00:00:57,091 --> 00:01:05,091
♪

25
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,909
Once upon a time in a land
far, far away, there was a

26
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,545
place, a very special place, a

27
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,582
clean, orderly, and nice place.

28
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,185
Usually I hate clean,
orderly, and nice.

29
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:06,186
The air smells fresh and
physically fit, statuesque

30
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,928
blondes lined by old
buildings and canals.

31
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,931
I read something
disturbing on my way here.

32
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,833
Apparently Denmark is, like, the

33
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,001
happiest place on earth.

34
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,536
They actually keep
stats on this.

35
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,238
Apparently Denmark is far and

36
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,340
away number one the happiest,

37
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,108
most content place on earth.

38
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,944
Well, the colleges are
the same for everybody.

39
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:25,779
Free?

40
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:26,547
Free.

41
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:27,614
That's un-American.

42
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:30,450
That's socialism, isn't it?

43
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,051
Yes.

44
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:37,757
I mean, here, that's
not a bad word.

45
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:38,958
Okay, they pay, like, 60%
of their earnings in taxes.

46
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,960
But then they do get things
like free health care.

47
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,797
52 weeks maternity
leave on full pay.

48
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,799
When I had my kids two rooms

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,635
down, that's where the
future king had his kids.

50
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,637
There's no, like, Beyonce suite.

51
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:51,572
No.

52
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:51,972
We're all there.

53
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:52,906
We're all the same.

54
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:54,307
That makes people more happy.

55
00:02:54,308 --> 00:03:02,308
That looks like a
nightmare to me.

56
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,950
By the way, it would be

57
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,419
helpful to point out, this
show is not about Denmark.

58
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,055
It's not about Copenhagen.

59
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,324
I'm here for one man.

60
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,392
Follow this way.

61
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:13,060
And one restaurant.

62
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:18,765
And then we can start.

63
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:22,001
Noma is the place where Renee

64
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:28,608
pretty much changed the
whole world of gastronomy.

65
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,909
For three years in a world, it

66
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,010
was named the world's best

67
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,346
restaurant by a jury of world

68
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,147
chefs and food writers who

69
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:43,148
presumably know such things.

70
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,796
Whoa.

71
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:49,863
And so, the question.

72
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:51,197
How does this nice, down to

73
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,932
earth guy rise to the top of the

74
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,701
food world all while presenting

75
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,003
things that no one could

76
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:01,007
possibly think would
taste that good?

77
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:01,809
The flowers.

78
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,710
Oh, man.

79
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,813
I'm not sure, but that's
what I'm here to find out.

80
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,381
The moss?

81
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,215
Yes, chef.

82
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,450
We know that Noma has been

83
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,818
said to be the world's best.

84
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,155
This is a dish that
is 20 man hours.

85
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,224
What we've heard outside of

86
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,059
Denmark is that Rene sources his

87
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,328
ingredients exclusively from the

88
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:27,334
Nordic region, mostly from
within 60 miles of the

89
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:27,701
restaurant.

90
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,402
Think about that.

91
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:33,706
Denmark is not exactly
the Mediterranean.

92
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:37,977
Summers are short.

93
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,812
What Rene and crew started, what

94
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:44,651
they're famous for,
is their ingredients.

95
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,085
And color me dubious.

96
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:51,057
Did you ever eat moss before?

97
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,593
No.

98
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,994
That is incredible.

99
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:58,365
There's no way that this is
going to look convincingly

100
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,532
delicious on TV.

101
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,168
But it is really delicious.

102
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:10,169
Alsandro Porcheli is
Italian living in Denmark.

103
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,946
I met Rene in 2004.

104
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:19,118
Basically the restaurant
was just opened.

105
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:23,122
Ten years after Noma's
inception, Rene is arguably the

106
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,291
most famous Dane since Hamlet.

107
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,960
So it's happily
ever after, right?

108
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,295
Not quite.

109
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:32,765
All this happened
actually in Copenhagen.

110
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:38,638
You have all these rules, these

111
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,973
guidelines where you never
brag about yourself.

112
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:44,711
The law which discourages

113
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:45,579
attention-seeking is part and

114
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,214
parcel of living in Denmark.

115
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,116
Danes who think too big are

116
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:50,817
often cut down by their peers.

117
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,985
It's hard to really make an

118
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,887
effort, and if you stand out too

119
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,489
much, you know, get
off your horse.

120
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,158
Okay, so let's say you start

121
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,593
a restaurant and you announce

122
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,128
right away, this restaurant is

123
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,832
going to be different than
anybody else's restaurant.

124
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,435
Are people mean originally?

125
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,437
Do they talk... about you?

126
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:14,607
I mean, how much foul language
can I use on this show?

127
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:19,679
We very quickly became the
big band of the seal...

128
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,348
People can be so cruel.

129
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,251
Do Danes like this place?

130
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:25,486
No?

131
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:28,320
It's got the attention
of the whole world.

132
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,759
Yeah, exactly.

133
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,663
To tell the truth, food
nerds, captains of industry,

134
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:37,531
celebrities, you name it have

135
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:42,334
been flocking here for years.

136
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:47,607
Some waiting months for a
reservation in a 45-seat

137
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:48,542
restaurant.

138
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,543
Do we have the leek?

139
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,545
It's marinating.

140
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:59,852
All of this green snow
is made from leaves.

141
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:00,788
That's good.

142
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:01,888
You don't notice it.

143
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,056
You notice the flavor.

144
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,692
That's delicious.

145
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:07,359
That's really intensely... like

146
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:15,360
I've never tasted a green
vegetable that good.

147
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,706
You see lawns, people sit
down, the sun is out.

148
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,341
The birds are singing.

149
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:26,078
This is where happiness
was invented.

150
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,516
Tubali gardens, it is said,

151
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:33,686
is the second-oldest
amusement park in the world.

152
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,655
Watch the pantomime that
is hundreds of years old.

153
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,590
I've only been here once
with my kids, actually.

154
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:41,928
I work all the time,
unfortunately.

155
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:42,830
This is usually the place where

156
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,363
young kids take
their first date.

157
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,566
How old is this thing?

158
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,400
I don't know, man.

159
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,768
This is made for kids.

160
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:54,574
Does it feel a bit wobbly?

161
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,875
Copenhagen is dangerous, too.

162
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,443
Yeah, right.

163
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:57,711
Whoa.

164
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:58,945
There you go.

165
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,212
This is not bad.

166
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,413
There you see.

167
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,450
It's a little tiny cart.

168
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,686
It's not huge, is it?

169
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:07,720
Squished in the middle.

170
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:11,023
It's like Singapore.

171
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:11,859
All dense together.

172
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,892
No death penalty.

173
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:20,299
Only the public humiliation.

174
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,301
Oh, here we go.

175
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,370
Firearms, apparently,
it's okay here.

176
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,605
You know, I've actually never

177
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,139
fired a firearm in my life.

178
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,941
Really?

179
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:31,377
And I've never driven a car.

180
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:31,979
You've never driven a car?

181
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,479
Never driven a car.

182
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,047
Okay.

183
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,214
This will be empowering.

184
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:39,786
This could change
your whole life.

185
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:46,092
You don't need to tell
him, he's American.

186
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,159
Is this a competition?

187
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,898
Call it what you like.

188
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:59,899
All right.

189
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:07,847
Oh, this is exciting.

190
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,982
We definitely have a winner.

191
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:10,350
Oh, my god.

192
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,684
Not a single one?

193
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:16,522
That's what we call
a nice grouping.

194
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:20,492
This is like public
school, shooting range.

195
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,328
After this, we're
going to steal a car.

196
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,196
I'll teach you to drive.

197
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,365
Come on, guys.

198
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,767
They're waiting.

199
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:30,202
Familiar with this one at all?

200
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,203
No.

201
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,272
It's served around
Christmas time.

202
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,441
You've got a little fish
rammed right through.

203
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,209
I love it.

204
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,443
Isn't this tweet?

205
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:42,214
There's a pickled
cucumber in the middle.

206
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,283
That's great.

207
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,685
Very traditional flavors.

208
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,053
There's all these old school

209
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,721
restaurants that have been
here hundreds of years.

210
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:55,862
The herring, smoked fish,
the traditional stuff.

211
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,697
There we go.

212
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,331
Thank you, my good man.

213
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:03,402
Welcome to the happiest
place... on earth.

214
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,237
On earth.

215
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:07,073
There we go.

216
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,877
Smoked eel.

217
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,544
Pickled herring.

218
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,580
These tiny little shrimps, one

219
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,715
of the few seasonal offerings

220
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,249
that Danes look forward to.

221
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,186
Our eating traditions
aren't that big here.

222
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,154
Historically, we've
eaten for survival.

223
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,824
It was fuel to us.

224
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,026
Not exactly the most fun bunch.

225
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:30,029
It was sinful to take too
much pleasure in food.

226
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,031
You're sitting at the table,

227
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,499
like oh, my god, that's so good.

228
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,067
It's delicious.

229
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:37,670
You're already going down a

230
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,706
slippery slope of who knows what

231
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,107
other kinds of behaviors.

232
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,842
My father is an immigrant here.

233
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,543
I'm not even a full Dane.

234
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,579
Your father was... the
former Yugoslavia.

235
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,116
And left Yugoslavia at what age?

236
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:50,718
14.

237
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,685
People make fun of me when I say

238
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,754
I've never driven a car.

239
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:58,958
I never had a Coca-Cola
until I was, like, 17.

240
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,793
It just wasn't in a small little

241
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,029
village where there's two cars.

242
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,464
The first food I have is also

243
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,966
from there, and
it was my father.

244
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,467
And the day before we had been

245
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,469
into the mountain
picking chestnuts.

246
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,604
And I remember it so vividly as

247
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,642
a little child, I saw my
father roasting chestnuts.

248
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:22,548
And then I start hearing
all these things popping.

249
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,316
20 minutes later, they were in a

250
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,118
bowl and my aunt poured milk

251
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,419
that she had just taken from the

252
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,089
cow and we had that
for breakfast.

253
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,492
It was so natural that we
went to the mountain for the

254
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,495
chestnuts, you grew
your food yourself.

255
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,563
These sort of experiences

256
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,798
growing up, they really shaped

257
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,569
the type of cook I am today.

258
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,782
So now you have a generation

259
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,283
of young cooks like myself all

260
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,251
over town looking for
the flavor of a region.

261
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,453
What is the flavor?

262
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,022
What are the ingredients we

263
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,155
have, and how do we combine them

264
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,623
in a way that tells something of

265
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:09,528
where you are in the world?

266
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,765
Between me and nature,
there's not so much love.

267
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:16,302
Nature is where bugs live.

268
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,537
But I'm learning reluctantly

269
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,673
over time how much
I've been missing.

270
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,675
Rene's proclivity to scrounge

271
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,045
around for flavorful
stuff that grows wild...

272
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,814
Welcome to the beach.

273
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,315
Pretty much kick started the

274
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:32,484
restaurant world's now widely

275
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,153
emulated practice of foraging.

276
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,056
You see all this?

277
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:37,324
Grass.

278
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:41,527
But these are succulents.

279
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,896
Rene's thing, since the

280
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:47,199
beginning, how to put
in what's around you.

281
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,536
To be a 19th century naturalist,
you're going to have

282
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:51,338
to do this.

283
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:55,207
Yes, a naturalist.

284
00:12:55,208 --> 00:13:00,179
Chew on this.

285
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,713
Taste delightful?

286
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,014
Yes, it's wonderful.

287
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,250
Disguised as grass.

288
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,218
Here, here, here.

289
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,153
It's everywhere.

290
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:14,154
Good to go.

291
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,064
So, I know these ingredients,

292
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:21,667
we were plucking
them just today.

293
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,335
Yes.

294
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,070
Wow.

295
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,772
This will be the future.

296
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,374
Let's go forage, guys.

297
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,242
Come on, kids.

298
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,044
There you go.

299
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,545
Sea beans.

300
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,713
Salty, juicy, crunchy.

301
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,549
If I were looking at this
home, I would very much be

302
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,919
thinking, come on, man.

303
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,387
It's grass.

304
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,354
It's green stuff.

305
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:42,388
It all tastes the say.

306
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,522
It totally doesn't.

307
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:44,924
It totally doesn't.

308
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,959
Is some of this stuff poison?

309
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,427
Yeah.

310
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:50,762
Have you ever eaten
something that... oh, yeah.

311
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,932
On-the-spot diarrhea.

312
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:53,233
Really?

313
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:53,800
Yeah.

314
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,601
The dark side of foraging.

315
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,970
Two fish heads.

316
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,405
Growing your own food,
finding your own food.

317
00:13:59,406 --> 00:13:59,973
Yeah.

318
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:02,741
That was life in Macedonia.

319
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:03,310
Yeah.

320
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:09,781
But for a lot of people
now, it is an affectation.

321
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,751
The worst meals are people
following a culinary trend.

322
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,087
They'll say there's an edible.

323
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:19,758
But it tastes like... but it's

324
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:27,299
edible and it will go on
the fish no matter what.

325
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,004
Oher, okay.

326
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,241
You just pick off
every little bit.

327
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,509
But I think even at its most

328
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,611
ludicrous manifestation, surely

329
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,947
it is a positive thing that

330
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:44,516
people are actually starting to

331
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,652
look around and see,
where it grows...

332
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,087
It still is good.

333
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,688
People are being connected
to the place they're in.

334
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,823
What's edible and what's not.

335
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,261
What is there to eat.

336
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,795
This is beach mustard.

337
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,330
In three weeks, this is gone.

338
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:02,935
New things come up.

339
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:06,338
It's sour dough bread.

340
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,807
It's butter that has not
been churned all the way.

341
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,176
It's called virgin butter.

342
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:10,978
Oh, god.

343
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,211
This is amazing, huh?

344
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,113
Butter like this where you

345
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,948
can pretty much taste
what the cow ate.

346
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,483
Anyone who's milked a cow, this

347
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,650
is a flavor of childhood.

348
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,819
There aren't a lot of people

349
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,955
left where I came from
who milked a cow.

350
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:26,025
This has become more important
to what these guys are

351
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:26,293
doing.

352
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:34,294
A relationship also that
they had with the farmers.

353
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:43,009
This is Soren's farm, but
we always say our farm.

354
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,576
We feel like it's our place.

355
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:47,179
Soren is his primary
supplier of vegetables.

356
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,016
You see all the shells?

357
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,718
These are shellfish.

358
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,187
Like Rene, he's not your
ordinary Dane and his farm is

359
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,023
unlike the others around here.

360
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,159
This used to be monoculture.

361
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,860
Yep.

362
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:01,927
Just carrots.

363
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,030
Now what are you growing?

364
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:07,366
Between 120 and 170
different things.

365
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,668
True, there are tractors and

366
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,870
rows where potatoes
and carrots grow.

367
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:16,542
But much of what's happening
here is a mix of wild and

368
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:16,876
cultivated.

369
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:20,512
This is wild Angelica.

370
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:25,751
That's chives and the purple
flowers, wild onions.

371
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,719
Let's grow some for next year.

372
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,721
First time you come up here, you

373
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,923
go into this, like
oh, flower garden.

374
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:36,795
You say no, no, no,
this is the leek field.

375
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,130
Touching them like
they're jewels.

376
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,232
They are jewels.

377
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:48,233
Let's grab a bunch of
these for lunch, no?

378
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,542
The pressure to provide year

379
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,710
in, year out what you know is

380
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,579
going to sell and what
the market demands.

381
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,382
Do you mind grabbing a
few of these plants?

382
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,484
They're going to grow up,
so don't take the root.

383
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,220
It's very, very hard for a

384
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,954
small guy to say I'm not going

385
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,424
to grow carrots anymore, I'm

386
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,558
going to grow interesting things

387
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,460
and grow them as well as I can.

388
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,661
This is pretty much
a first for me.

389
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:10,929
This is the first time you

390
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,165
fall to your knees
for a green plant?

391
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:13,933
Yeah.

392
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,601
How long for leeks?

393
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:20,772
Do you think we'll ever reach
a point where guys like

394
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,274
Supervissoren will be
in a very good place?

395
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,342
I think if we cut the middle

396
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,612
men, the producers, the farmer,

397
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,148
to talk directly with
a guy like Rene.

398
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,683
Nobody ever teaches you it's

399
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,452
with these people
that grow the food.

400
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:36,122
You're never taught that as
a cook, which is strange.

401
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,457
Can we have another leek that

402
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:43,195
looks more similar in
size to that one, please?

403
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:43,863
I think also, respect to you

404
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,764
all chefs, how should you know

405
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,166
anything about this landscape?

406
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,967
I've been here for 30 years and

407
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:54,306
I just know small, tiny parts.

408
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,874
So we just scoop it up.

409
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,709
I think we picked
these yesterday.

410
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,445
Oh yeah?

411
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:01,313
Oh, man.

412
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:09,314
That is the meatiest
vegetable I've ever had.

413
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:13,359
Maybe we'll cook this for
lunch spiced with a tartar.

414
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,161
Chop that up with the freshly

415
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:19,531
slaughtered meat, one
of Soren's cows.

416
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,833
What else?

417
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,235
The asparagus?

418
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,737
Yes, let's do that.

419
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,139
I'm hungry.

420
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,907
Asparagus.

421
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,210
Beautiful.

422
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,912
Let's go.

423
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:39,851
Just one dollop, okay?

424
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,687
Do not eat that branch.

425
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,489
Okay.

426
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,358
Underneath is a small pile of

427
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,829
tender... asparagus sauce
and fresh green paste.

428
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,532
That is incredible.

429
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,866
Wow.

430
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,036
The flavor of this, huh?

431
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:04,710
So this is actually beer
made from asparagus.

432
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:05,412
It's tasty.

433
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:08,380
What was the name of the cow?

434
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,917
76377330.

435
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:14,119
Chef, do you want
to do the tartar?

436
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,522
What are you thinking,
just hack up the meat?

437
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,057
Hack up the meat.

438
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,459
It already looks good.

439
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,464
I'm going to go on the
asparagus and the leeks.

440
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,399
Clean them up, grill then.

441
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,568
Do you want to do
a potato salad?

442
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,403
Yeah.

443
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:33,305
What you would put
on the tartar.

444
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,706
Wild onions.

445
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:38,043
A bit of this horseradish.

446
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,878
That's the chives.

447
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:40,979
Chive flowers.

448
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,781
Okay.

449
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:46,418
A little salt on the leek
and a little cheese?

450
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,453
Yes.

451
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:48,887
That's the Angelica.

452
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:56,888
Take all these flowers
and we mix that in.

453
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,998
Some vinegar.

454
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:00,600
Done.

455
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:04,270
Didn't take us ten minutes,
but we have four courses.

456
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:07,005
This is like three
Michelin stars.

457
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,073
Oh, yeah.

458
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,442
Oh, man.

459
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,311
Perfect.

460
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,979
Look at that.

461
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,681
Wow.

462
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,482
Wow, wow, wow.

463
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:17,983
And that egg.

464
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,418
What an egg.

465
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,819
Do you eat like
this all the time?

466
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,421
I bring my kids up here.

467
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,122
All the staff comes here often.

468
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,292
This becomes your reference

469
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,794
frame for how fresh an
asparagus should be?

470
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:29,662
Just harvest.

471
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:30,962
Just cooked.

472
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:31,698
Just eaten.

473
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:32,964
I think a place like this, in

474
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,467
addition to being the best
restaurant in the world and

475
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,669
whatever else, it offers a real

476
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,705
possibility that there is food

477
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:40,806
around that with a little

478
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,974
effort, or a lot of effort, you

479
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,411
can make into something
really delicious.

480
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:50,982
That is the hard thing.

481
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,519
To change the way people
think about food.

482
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,321
Thank you for joining.

483
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:56,289
Thank you, chef.

484
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,257
It's magnificent.

485
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,401
There are always going to be

486
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,636
some people out there who hate

487
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:11,970
the very idea of your existence.

488
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:12,472
Yeah.

489
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:20,473
From the very minute they
even think about you.

490
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:25,851
There's a Danish expression for

491
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:26,852
not wanting to stand out.

492
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:27,320
Yeah.

493
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:30,756
Not wanting to talk
about yourself.

494
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:35,594
The law of yenta.

495
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:36,429
Yeast broth.

496
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,229
It's beautiful.

497
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,433
Here we are ten years ago,
we're opening, we're saying

498
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,436
we're going to try
something else.

499
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:47,272
Stuff like that in that
time was just unheard of.

500
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,240
It was beyond stupid.

501
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,441
And why do you even try?

502
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:56,748
Why are you fiddling
with stupid concepts?

503
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:59,084
This is very complex.

504
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,186
I know in the beginning, a lot

505
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,288
of Danes were calling him...

506
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,391
They were laughing at him.

507
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:07,859
It's a very new thing.

508
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,396
It's not something they
have in Italy, France.

509
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,063
Here it's a different story.

510
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,231
You have a huge part of people

511
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:18,303
that are still so much in
love with the old world.

512
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,305
I mean, I've even been told that

513
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,073
I have fascist tendencies.

514
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,143
There's been op-eds written in

515
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,878
Danish papers linking what we do

516
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,380
at the restaurant to some of the

517
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:32,217
most horrible moments
in recent history.

518
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:35,921
This is the tail of the lobster,

519
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,989
with a little bit of the
head juices underneath.

520
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,826
Use your hands.

521
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:41,827
I will.

522
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,829
It's luxurious.

523
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,296
So how is it changing?

524
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,165
That's what's interesting.

525
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:52,103
In ten years, it's really gone

526
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,172
from, you know... to igniting a

527
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,841
new confidence in this city in

528
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:59,978
this part of the world
that I never grew up with.

529
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,680
A possible forebearer to this

530
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,850
new challenging of the status

531
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:05,518
quo can be found right in the

532
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:13,519
heart of this great-laced
Danish capital.

533
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:23,535
The well established
hippie squatte squatters.

534
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:25,604
But there are some
interesting features.

535
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,605
There's no government to intrude

536
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:27,706
on your personal freedom.

537
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:31,843
You're free to behave as

538
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,044
eccentric fashion as you wish.

539
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,713
If you want to spend your day

540
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,015
talking to a tree, you can do

541
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,550
that without being frowned upon.

542
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:41,453
They are in local
government, such as it is.

543
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,555
He has been here
for some 40 years.

544
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,524
It was a military area that was

545
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:47,158
abandoned and then occupied by

546
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,894
squatters and hippies, despite

547
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,996
the fact that the different
governments didn't really

548
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,998
appreciate what was going on

549
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:53,999
here, nobody actually had the

550
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,468
will or strength
to put people out.

551
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,037
Who makes up the traction?

552
00:23:59,038 --> 00:23:59,839
We do.

553
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,641
What about the essentials,
electric, water.

554
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:05,877
We buy it from providers.

555
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:06,978
We pay only one bill.

556
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,480
But I like the fact that my

557
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:09,715
kids get to walk around the

558
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:10,882
streets without worrying about

559
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,418
being run over by a car.

560
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,687
There's no cars running
in the streets.

561
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:18,223
It's like a little village.

562
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:18,925
It's very secure.

563
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:23,729
Are you a hippie?

564
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,030
He is.

565
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,932
Two eggs smoking now.

566
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:29,000
Right down there, we have

567
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,869
pusher street, probably
the most famous part.

568
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,440
The green section, right?

569
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:36,042
Weed, hash oil.

570
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:37,909
I would never do that as a

571
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,110
responsible journalist, but I'm

572
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,113
interested in investigating it.

573
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:46,852
It is a beloved
institution here.

574
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:51,557
You are free to try an array
of cannabis products.

575
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:52,858
Theoretically, marijuana is,

576
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,526
like, not legal in Denmark.

577
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:56,227
But there's a great tolerance

578
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,063
for marijuana here and I think

579
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,566
that's because it
isn't really harmful.

580
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:04,770
People who smoke too much,
maybe they pass out.

581
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,405
Right.

582
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,574
Quail egg cooked.

583
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:08,808
Wow.

584
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:11,943
That's like the
greatest thing ever.

585
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:19,944
I want more of those.

586
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:24,255
So there's nobody in charge.

587
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:24,991
I am.

588
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,658
I'm in charge.

589
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:27,393
Yeah.

590
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:28,994
The only problem is
everybody else is, too.

591
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:30,962
It seems utopia.

592
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,163
We have the same problems as

593
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:36,001
anybody, but we try to solve
them in a different way.

594
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,268
One of the ways we try to

595
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,837
solve the sort of challenges by

596
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,438
embracing people
as much as we can.

597
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:46,978
And trying to make space
as much as we can.

598
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,815
Do we have two peas
ready for table four?

599
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:53,819
Can I go over that now?

600
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,520
Yes.

601
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,188
Extraordinary.

602
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:58,590
I was reading something that's

603
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,592
very un-American in its concept,

604
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:03,929
which is don't be
afraid to fail.

605
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,198
When we did this issue, to us

606
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:07,867
it was a very big moment.

607
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,334
We burnt it by mistake.

608
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:12,203
We thought okay, it's a mistake.

609
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:12,805
Let's see what happens.

610
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:13,673
We cooked it.

611
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:15,373
Then we had a new spice.

612
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:18,209
That's indescribably delicious.

613
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,611
All cook books, particularly

614
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:20,812
American cook books, are written

615
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:21,847
from the point of view that if

616
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:25,216
you only follow this recipe,
it will turn out great.

617
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,018
You're safe.

618
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:27,352
This is what we try to talk

619
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,554
about every day in the kitchen

620
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:34,960
with the cooks on
Saturday night projects.

621
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:36,561
Apparently this is when you

622
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,797
invite members of your crew to

623
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,867
put up a new dish for comment.

624
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:44,002
After each grueling workweek

625
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:45,036
concludes, cooks from every

626
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,905
level of the brigade stay late

627
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:49,708
to submit their newest
culinary ideas.

628
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:50,677
Everybody's in on this?

629
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:51,510
Everybody's in.

630
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:55,747
This could be a very
uncomfortable... you're heading

631
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:56,382
it out.

632
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:59,384
This forum is about failure.

633
00:26:59,385 --> 00:26:59,551
Yes.

634
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,019
So let's see what you got.

635
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,489
Luke, go for it.

636
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,091
In no point in my career

637
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,424
would I have wanted to subject

638
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,960
myself to this kind
of mass scrutiny.

639
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,495
But watch.

640
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:11,363
It's not bad.

641
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:15,935
It can be bad.

642
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,936
Fermented apple tea.

643
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:23,041
This one I did with razor clam

644
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:27,946
and some cammomile as well.

645
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:32,250
It just ferments in
water and 2% salt.

646
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,720
This is fondue
with brown butter.

647
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:37,288
What we have here, ice
cream with some barley.

648
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:44,262
Mushroom ice cream and
fermented barley sauce.

649
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,798
Personally I'm not getting

650
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,767
what they brought to the party.

651
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:49,801
It's a little sweet.

652
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,469
With this broth,
it's quite sweet.

653
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,972
So it becomes very
one-dimensional.

654
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:57,375
Why can't you do that
for your next project?

655
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:58,609
Dry salt versus brine salt.

656
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,447
He uses things I
would never use.

657
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,315
And it tastes good.

658
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,415
I like it.

659
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,152
Given a choice of a
traditional dessert and this,

660
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,087
I'm very happy with this.

661
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,991
I think it's delicious.

662
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:16,627
Thank you.

663
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:21,967
Who's next?

664
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:22,168
Oh!

665
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:25,570
So here we have a dish of
strawberries and cream.

666
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,305
I just decided to go on my bike

667
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:28,740
and see what I could get.

668
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,008
All the flowers that are here,

669
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,744
the lady let me pick
them in her garden.

670
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:36,114
So strawberries that are
pickled in Rose vinegar.

671
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,849
The base has been infused with

672
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:44,089
burnt roses and Rose pollen.

673
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:49,829
Do we just clap or... yes.

674
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,502
And that might well
end up on the menu?

675
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:58,137
No.

676
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:00,772
This is not about putting
things on the menu.

677
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:04,209
I mean, if somebody makes
a masterpiece, it's their

678
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:04,510
masterpiece.

679
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:04,877
Really?

680
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:06,211
Yeah, yeah.

681
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:07,013
Of course.

682
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:09,047
Isn't it your hysterical

683
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,281
imperative as the chef to take

684
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:11,682
his good work and innovation and

685
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,652
put it on the menu and take
credit for it as your own?

686
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:17,388
I mean, that's the way it's
been done for centuries.

687
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,724
This is not the point here.

688
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:22,360
The pursuit of enlightenment

689
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:23,728
and knowledge is its own reward?

690
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:24,863
To me, yes.

691
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,365
Is that it?

692
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,500
Cheers, everybody.

693
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,379
Table four is being cleared.

694
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,713
Let's start dressing.

695
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,382
They're waiting.

696
00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:44,415
Yes, chef.

697
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:47,385
Now I travel a lot.

698
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:50,088
You know, I want to be
number one in the world.

699
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,891
I was in Mexico, the Yucatan.

700
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:57,062
They don't even know how
to make a tortilla.

701
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:59,164
They lose touch with
what tradition is.

702
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,866
That looks good.

703
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:06,237
It's good for you to try
this, the herring, the rye

704
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:09,540
bread, the traditional stuff.

705
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,177
When you grow up as a cook here,

706
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:15,613
you don't see it as an
inspiration for your future

707
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:16,248
endeavors.

708
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:20,085
The next thing we serve
you is flat bread.

709
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:20,586
Very traditional here.

710
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:27,425
We spice ours with chutes
of spruce and oak tree.

711
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,294
This is amazing.

712
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:29,761
Amazing.

713
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,029
Sophistication.

714
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,464
Something that is so down
to earth flavor-wise.

715
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,565
No doubt about it.

716
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:42,566
That seems both really
classic and totally new.

717
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:47,778
Cheers.

718
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,081
I'm learning, Danes may be

719
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:56,955
stiff, but they sure as
hell know how to drink.

720
00:30:56,956 --> 00:31:00,225
Nils is a Danish
renaissance man.

721
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:05,763
Drinker, sailor, charter tour
boat operator, musician.

722
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:08,099
I have known him from
the absolute beginning.

723
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,634
When Noma... can we start now?

724
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:10,936
Yeah, we're going.

725
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,503
Well, what did you think of him

726
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:13,604
when you first met him?

727
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,907
I saw an ordinary man.

728
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,976
He fight for what
he think about.

729
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,010
He had a vision.

730
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,912
Yeah, a vision.

731
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:24,615
And fight for this.

732
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,318
It's very close.

733
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:27,653
Yeah.

734
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:32,357
Nicely done, chef.

735
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:33,691
There we are.

736
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,026
Look at the beautiful
girl there.

737
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:35,661
Cheers.

738
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:38,329
Here we go.

739
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:44,669
What was that?

740
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,337
What's in it?

741
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,771
What is that?

742
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,540
I don't know exactly
how you make that.

743
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:53,211
But it has been drinking
in Denmark for many years.

744
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:56,714
So we have gameldansk.

745
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,484
It has about 30
different herbs or so.

746
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:04,855
So we made an ice cream.

747
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,057
It was delicious.

748
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:09,860
Oh, here we go.

749
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:10,196
Gameldansk.

750
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:10,496
It is good.

751
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,363
It works.

752
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,298
It is good.

753
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,199
It works.

754
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:13,865
Look at this.

755
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:15,400
Where you come from, New York?

756
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:15,901
Yeah.

757
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:16,835
Yeah.

758
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:17,369
What?

759
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:22,140
It works.

760
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:28,046
He says.

761
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,047
They are perfect.

762
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:31,983
What would traditional
Danish food be for you?

763
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:33,418
Potatoes.

764
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,719
Two potatoes.

765
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,355
And some kind of meat and sauce.

766
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:40,558
Do you taste the sauce?

767
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:40,759
Yeah?

768
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,194
Hello, fellows.

769
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,929
Fermented barley, and we cooked

770
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,600
the potatoes in that and served

771
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:54,405
with sturgeon roll
from the lakes.

772
00:32:54,406 --> 00:33:02,406
It has homemade whiskey...
I know the flavor well.

773
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:07,885
Here we go!

774
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:08,754
What are we doing?

775
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:10,688
I'm a little bit hungry.

776
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:18,689
The Danish national
late night dish.

777
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,766
John's hot dog?

778
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:22,000
Yes.

779
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:27,805
I'll have the deluxe.

780
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:28,640
Organic sausage.

781
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,608
Sounds good to me.

782
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:32,977
He made his own mustard.

783
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:34,045
Wow.

784
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:34,280
Whoa.

785
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:35,880
Here we go.

786
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:39,884
That's a classic one.

787
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:44,222
All my happiest moments seem

788
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:46,557
to revolve around
meat in two forms.

789
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:47,825
That's superb.

790
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:51,896
It's really good.

791
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,965
Don't thrill me when I eat that.

792
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,801
Only the moments
when you look good.

793
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:59,804
These onions are awesome.

794
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,106
I think that's the way.

795
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:01,940
You have to make something new.

796
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:05,843
But respect the classics.

797
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:09,480
The passion to present
something on a plate that is

798
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,516
delicious, also make sense of

799
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:17,588
your own environment,
something that is yours.

800
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:24,062
Come to Copenhagen, Noma for
lunch, John's for dinner.

801
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:42,613
Just across from Noma,
located in a converted

802
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,815
houseboat, an entity separate
from the restaurant.

803
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:49,987
The place where Rene set
up to further ideas and

804
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:50,356
experimentation.

805
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:52,357
He is one of the
guys in charge here.

806
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:57,628
Nutmeg is a bit of
a hallucinogenic.

807
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,797
Leave it a while and
see what happens.

808
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,200
Hallucinogenic fish
sauce potentially?

809
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:02,968
In theory.

810
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:05,170
Some of the things we are doing,

811
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:06,971
they are pure experimentation

812
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,139
for experimentation sake and

813
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,807
it's pretty damn delicious.

814
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:10,141
I like that.

815
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,809
It's another food
item on your shelf.

816
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,911
Me as a cook,
that's what I want.

817
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:19,550
These are two years old
cherries with the cherry pits.

818
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,419
Five years old wild roses.

819
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,854
This is amazing.

820
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,256
They're talking about will it

821
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,358
taste good in two years if you

822
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,495
ferment it or age it or dry it.

823
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:31,029
We like to ferment it.

824
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,398
We add bacteria to it, so in

825
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:37,268
three years time, it
becomes delicious.

826
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,937
The diversity, you're looking at

827
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,071
fermentations and different

828
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,573
bacteria, looking at different

829
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,909
molds, yeast, all sorts.

830
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:51,182
There is stuff rotting in
jars, these experiments of

831
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:52,517
fermentation and flavor.

832
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:54,018
Doing some sinister down there.

833
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:58,689
This is the ferment from wild

834
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:04,295
spinach which grows around here.

835
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:06,564
May this is from a weed
that grows everywhere.

836
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,233
You can do it with gooseberries.

837
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,701
Like to ferment gooseberries.

838
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,670
You get golden drops
of perfection.

839
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,473
We have two berries.

840
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,041
The next thing we serve you is

841
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,043
the dried juices from last

842
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:27,044
year's harvest of black
currant, and then so creamy.

843
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:36,554
It's like superpower.

844
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,498
You need to ask about this.

845
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,300
Well, this is
pretty interesting.

846
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:45,903
This is born out of a desire
to study mummify kags.

847
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:49,807
Everyone used to eat
mummies, apparently.

848
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,242
So this has been cured with

849
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:54,512
resins, alcohol,
spices, with honey.

850
00:36:54,513 --> 00:37:01,586
All kinds of things that
would have been used in a

851
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:05,323
mummification process.

852
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:05,857
So it's quite moldy.

853
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:08,993
I mean, it's like an experiment.

854
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:12,096
It's a 6-month-old piece here.

855
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,698
I guess it's
somewhat inevitable.

856
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,600
It's not unpleasant.

857
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:15,967
Interesting.

858
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:22,373
Tastes like Egyptian.

859
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:26,711
We just have one project.

860
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:28,779
Deliciousness is an argument
for eating insects.

861
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,851
Wow.

862
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:39,724
Here we have grilled onions

863
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:41,158
and salt made out of wood ants.

864
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:41,960
That's delicious.

865
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:47,164
Some of the ants we've
been experimenting with.

866
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:50,335
It's like zing,
excitement in your mouth.

867
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:53,971
The other ones, they
need a lot of work.

868
00:37:53,972 --> 00:38:01,972
Here we've got wax
lava worm mousse.

869
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,884
This tastes like insects.

870
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,720
Next fermented fish, herrings

871
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,356
molded with stuffed Greens.

872
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:13,324
These have been
here since January.

873
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,693
So it's been filtered and put

874
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,028
with Juniper and a little squirt

875
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,531
of aged apple vinegar.

876
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:20,766
Wow.

877
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:23,334
That's delicious.

878
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:24,669
That's lethally good.

879
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,170
I can think of ten different

880
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,237
ways I'd like to eat that.

881
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:27,873
Definitely.

882
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:33,444
Standing up, sitting
down, with beer.

883
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,012
Beings are being fed.

884
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:37,915
It takes awhile to stumble
across these things.

885
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,285
Surely they come out
of the woodwork.

886
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,365
Let's have some crayfish.

887
00:38:54,366 --> 00:39:02,366
Delicious.

888
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:04,543
Cheers, guys.

889
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:04,910
Cheers, guys.

890
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:09,814
Cheers.

891
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:10,749
Mid-summer's day.

892
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,551
Longest day of the year.

893
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:17,655
The day to Mark the
mid-summer's Eve gather and

894
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:18,723
partake in traditions.

895
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:23,260
Then sun comes out,
we salute you.

896
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,062
Building picnics and bonfires.

897
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,330
There's going to be a fire.

898
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:27,565
And burning witches.

899
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,066
We made those fires back in

900
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,102
the days to keep
the witches away.

901
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:35,339
Because they thought all the

902
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:41,412
witches was meeting
on this solstice.

903
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:42,413
Where's the Pork?

904
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,081
This is the roast pork.

905
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:48,118
Very traditional.

906
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:48,920
Without this they
could not live.

907
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:56,921
So we have pork skin
and dried chocolate.

908
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,765
That's wild.

909
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:03,701
Roasted pork with cabbage.

910
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:09,940
That is a serious sandwich.

911
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,108
That's just amazing.

912
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,142
Oh, a rainbow.

913
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:20,143
This is almost too pretty.

914
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:26,691
And there you go.

915
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:31,328
Super cool, huh?

916
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:35,966
Why don't we have
the strawberries?

917
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:36,535
With triple cream, huh?

918
00:40:36,536 --> 00:40:39,804
It's delicious.

919
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:43,574
We have wild blueberry desserts.

920
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,142
The sandwich, one
for each of you.

921
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,412
And the first of the
wild strawberries.

922
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,247
Look at this.

923
00:40:49,248 --> 00:40:53,484
Like a picnic in the park, yeah?

924
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:54,552
Mm.

925
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:55,720
Wow.

926
00:40:55,721 --> 00:41:00,324
So the mid-summer
day in Denmark.

927
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:03,494
Wow.

928
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:04,829
Look at the witch.

929
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,199
Burn, witch, burn.

930
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:21,012
You done?

931
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:24,048
Terrific, thank you.

932
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,349
Unbelievable.

933
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,051
Look, I've eaten at a lot of

934
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,118
great restaurants around the

935
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,219
world, and there was still a

936
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,220
little part of me that was

937
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:35,293
saying this the going to be bull

938
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:37,962
The guy's out in the field

939
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:40,297
yanking weeds out of the ground.

940
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:42,199
I didn't expect it to
be as good as it was.

941
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,134
It was delicious.

942
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:44,636
Amazingly delicious.

943
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:45,403
Amazing.

944
00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:48,706
Yes, I thought it was amazing.

945
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:52,476
It's not just about coming
up with the concept.

946
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:58,048
It's assembling what is out
there in a new, beautiful,

947
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:58,884
authentic and delicious way.

948
00:41:58,885 --> 00:42:03,554
He has single handedly
transformed everybody's

949
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:06,490
understanding of
Nordic cuisines.

950
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:08,092
They all tell a bit of a story.

951
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:09,660
Of the land, the tradition.

952
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:11,495
But always delicious.

953
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:13,998
Always, always, always
delicious first.

954
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,966
You may be an ordinary guy,

955
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,735
grounded, comes
from a poor family.

956
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:19,169
But he has big dreams.

957
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,405
He wants to change the world.

958
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:21,907
And we can change it.

959
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:22,307
Never forget that.

960
00:42:22,308 --> 00:42:27,979
We can do that.
