187
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,704
Somebody with a penis but you

188
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,673
can with an octopus tentacle.

189
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:42,694
In Japan, there's a very old,
very deep, and very rich

190
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,196
tradition of martial arts.

191
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:49,335
Many styles, many schools.

192
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:53,672
The Yurakura gym
focuses on boxing.

193
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:57,376
And this man, Kenji, is a

194
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,911
legend, having trained fighters

195
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,813
using a simple and effective

196
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:01,914
philosophy that has some real

197
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,649
application to our story.

198
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,920
There it is pasted on the
wall behind the ring.

199
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,389
One, speed.

200
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,693
Two, timing.

201
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,397
Three, distance.

202
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:23,602
The same idea applies to the
convention-shunning Sushi

203
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,438
techniques of New York City
legend Naomichi Yasuda.

204
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,740
Until recently, the chef partner

205
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,010
of one of the very best, if not

206
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:36,248
the best Sushi
restaurant in new York.

207
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,850
The Sushi Yasuda.

208
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,919
A short while ago, under very

209
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,353
mysterious and completely

210
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,521
misreported circumstances, he

211
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,423
left the Manhattan restaurant

212
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:45,424
which still bears his name.

213
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:51,063
And at age 52 moved to Tokyo
to start all over again.

214
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,298
I was determined to track him

215
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:56,102
down and see what the
hell he was doing.

216
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,204
These days, this great man is

217
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:03,475
running a 14-seat
Sushi bar in Tokyo.

218
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:09,281
His wife Naomi is
his only helper.

219
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,582
Welcome to the place.

220
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,617
Thank you for coming.

221
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,453
Why did you do
such a hard thing?

222
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:20,592
This city, Tokyo, this is

223
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,795
kind of the maker of the Sushi.

224
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:31,796
So I just want to be the
Sushi chef in Tokyo.

225
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,440
Yasuda is a friend, and my

226
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:35,942
master in the sense that he's

227
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:36,809
taught me pretty much everything

228
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,411
I know about Sushi
over the years.

229
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,314
He's a very, very interesting

230
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:47,987
and complex man who
constantly surprises.

231
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:53,125
This is the most
expensive wasabi.

232
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:58,330
So I wait, wait, wait.

233
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,798
Finally, then I ball this.

234
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:06,838
It's very French of you.

235
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,709
So many things separate Yasuda

236
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,678
from other Japanese
Sushi masters.

237
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,380
The most noticeable
is his hands.

238
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,048
They're huge.

239
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,216
Look at the knuckles.

240
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,650
Enormous from years of pounding

241
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:25,357
cement walls during repeated
daily practice in karate.

242
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:29,295
He first trained and
competed in Tokyo.

243
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:33,865
When he came to New York,
he continued to practice.

244
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,236
Often in underground,
bare-knuckle matches, you fight

245
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:40,406
until someone gets
beaten to the ground.

246
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,041
This style Yasuda practiced was

247
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,376
about beating your opponent as

248
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,913
quickly and as
aggressively as possible.

249
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:48,181
Speed.

250
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:51,383
Every second is important.

251
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,884
The rice is getting cold, the

252
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,322
seaweed is getting soggy, fish,

253
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,257
less than perfect temperature.

254
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:58,590
Look at his posture.

255
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,326
A fighter's stance.

256
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,729
Distance, knowing the
perfect spot to be.

257
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,731
Moving in and out as needed.

258
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,000
Never out of position.

259
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:08,701
Timing.

260
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:10,869
Reacting to his customer's pace

261
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,105
of eating, their ever-changing

262
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:18,577
desires, always ready
for the next move.

263
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:22,014
Most people who don't
understand Sushi will go to a

264
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,783
Sushi bar and say oh, I had
the best Sushi last night.

265
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:25,951
The fish was so fresh.

266
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,254
It was right out of the ocean.

267
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,922
The freshest fish,
there is no taste.

268
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,925
Just chewing, just hard.

269
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,596
And people think
freshest should be good.

270
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,431
But it wasn't.

271
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:42,068
Yasuda's menu changes constantly
with what he finds in

272
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,769
the market.

273
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,204
Like thousands of other Sushi

274
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:49,708
chefs, he heads every day to

275
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,610
Tsukiji, Tokyo's central fish

276
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,579
market, where the world's best

277
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,047
seafood arrives every day.

278
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,982
But unlike most others at his

279
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,451
level who arrive at 4:00 A.M. to

280
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,719
get what they perceive as the

281
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,622
best and freshest,
Yasuda arrives later.

282
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,225
He does not buy the ridiculously

283
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,427
expensive otoro, the fatty belly

284
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,829
meat of the blue fin tuna that

285
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,464
people have been known to pay

286
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,965
hundreds of dollars a pound for.

287
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,135
Instead, he buys tuna from the

288
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,769
heads, using his knife skills to

289
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,505
go for qualities that most

290
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,640
others miss, removing every bit

291
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,942
of sinew from what would

292
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:28,480
otherwise be a difficult
piece of meat.

293
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,616
In total, it's, well, perfect.

294
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:31,983
And he cures the results.

295
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,185
Actually cures it.

296
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,122
Breaking down its molecular

297
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,523
structure in a desirable way by

298
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,659
freezing it quickly in a medical

299
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,528
grade blast freezer where it

300
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,195
will stay for a week or longer

301
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,030
in minus 82 degrees Celsius.

302
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,665
He pioneered this technique

303
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,833
years ago in New York, where if

304
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,535
you bothered to ask, he would

305
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,670
have proudly told you that the

306
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,305
absolutely unbelievably sublime

307
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:59,378
piece of perfect Sushi you
were eating was frozen.

308
00:17:59,379 --> 00:17:59,946
Delicious.

309
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:01,513
Thank you very much.

310
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:05,484
Which is more important,
the rice or the fish?

311
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,518
Rice.

312
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,354
More important?

313
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:08,954
What percentage?

314
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,222
About 90%.

315
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,023
Wow.

316
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:15,327
Fish is the second ingredient.

317
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:19,798
The main ingredient is rice.

318
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,703
So my Sushi is rice.

319
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:29,040
Yasuda, he still trains,
though his fighting days are

320
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:29,309
over.

321
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:35,547
He says he was tired
of hurting people.

322
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,916
He brings me to try and show me

323
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,085
how his Sushi technique and

324
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:48,086
karate are one in the same.

325
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:09,574
Yuki Kamio, the master.

326
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:15,388
Nice.

327
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,189
People ask me, what's the

328
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,427
point between the
karate and the Sushi?

329
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:23,462
But this movement
is so much good

330
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:27,065
for when I make my Sushi.

331
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:33,104
Because of the stance.

332
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,606
The stance is more upper.

333
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:41,447
So this karate
stance is more deep.

334
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,148
So stand in front of the cutting

335
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:47,453
board, a deep stance
and movement.

336
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:54,793
Deep stance and body and
watch, through the right.

337
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,928
Move this, move this.

338
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,631
Watch this and watch this.

339
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:04,903
This is the key.

340
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:12,904
So this karate is
my Sushi stance.

341
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,795
Now, in an official tournament,
two-minute rounds.

342
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,330
Two-minute round.

343
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:34,366
And the result you are
looking for is points?

344
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:38,804
Points, or knockdown.

345
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,005
But two minutes fight.

346
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,807
One minutes fight.

347
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:46,278
That's most hardest.

348
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:46,713
It's underground.

349
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:48,380
You can just work on their legs

350
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,549
for five, seven minutes
to slow them down.

351
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,618
Then you go in.

352
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:53,320
Yes.

353
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:55,120
And not compromise.

354
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:55,722
Just do it.

355
00:20:55,723 --> 00:21:00,158
Whatever happen, no excuse.

356
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,027
See the result good or not.

357
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,695
If it's bad, try again.

358
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,865
Don't give up.

359
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:10,168
Right.

360
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:14,473
This is my Sushi.

361
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:18,478
Perfect.

362
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,675
Those who buy into the

363
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,877
notion of Japanese women as shy,

364
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:54,580
giggling, subservient victims of

365
00:21:54,581 --> 00:22:01,620
convention would be
confused by Tomika.

366
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,455
People, as everywhere, if you

367
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:11,456
look deeper, can surprise you.

368
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,634
Her day job is doing this.

369
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,736
And I gather from what she tells

370

that with real men.
