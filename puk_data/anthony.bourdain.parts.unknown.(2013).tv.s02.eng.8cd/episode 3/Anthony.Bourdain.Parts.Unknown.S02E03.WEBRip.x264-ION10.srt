1
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:12,079
Since I was 14 years old, I
always wore cowboy boots.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,580
Maybe because my little boy role

3
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:19,119
models were always the
men in the black hats.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,487
Richard Boone, Robert Vaughn in

5
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,789
"the magnificent seven."

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,491
Silent killers.

7
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:25,292
Men with pasts.

8
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:26,493
Men from somewhere else who

9
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:30,930
found themselves in the
great American west.

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,133
A place where reinvention, a new

11
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:36,136
life was always possible.

12
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:43,944
As long as you were
willing to kill for it.

13
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:52,812
♪

14
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:12,265
♪

15
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,358
The western myth has pretty
much captured the American

16
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:31,792
imagination.

17
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:33,193
None of us can escape it.

18
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,228
For ages, we identified

19
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,164
ourselves with the image of the

20
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:42,235
lone cowboy, the perception
of frontier values,

21
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,404
self-sufficiency, rugged
individualism, the freedom of

22
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:52,405
wide open spaces.

23
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,582
Few places in America still

24
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,184
manage to embody that mythic

25
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,385
landscape of the imagination

26
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:03,223
like the state of new Mexico.

27
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,891
What does freedom mean?

28
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,394
It's different things to
everybody, it seems, but

29
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:08,595
something about this place

30
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,197
manages to capture the overlap

31
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:11,831
between a whole hell of a lot of

32
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:16,836
very different cultures.

33
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,071
Old route 66 runs through new

34
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,408
Mexico like a collapsed vein,

35
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:24,611
right through Santa
Fe and Albuquerque.

36
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,846
It must have seemed
like magic once.

37
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,249
Families loaded in a massive

38
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,118
chrome and steel char yachts

39
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,255
with powerful v8 engines and

40
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,623
took off down that highway.

41
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:43,863
They swept in bungalows,
swam in kidney-shaped pools.

42
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,898
Then it all went redundant.

43
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,268
It was chopped up, largely

44
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:51,070
forgotten, except by desperate

45
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,072
and lazy travel show hosts.

46
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,141
Does anyone else do this, drive

47
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:59,879
around at like 10:15 at
night looking for tacos?

48
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,281
Probably.

49
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:00,881
I'll say this.

50
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:02,449
The strip takes on a much more

51
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,550
interesting look at night.

52
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,719
You can imagine Dennis hopper

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,288
huffing nitrous and dismembering

54
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:11,291
somebody over an unrolled
tarp in any one of those

55
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,760
sinister-looking motel rooms.

56
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,094
Cool.

57
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:16,263
Hopefully the tacos first,

58
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:19,332
because after you do the meth

59
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,433
you really aren't
going to want to eat.

60
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,934
In ancient times, drivers would

61
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,404
hang the testicles of their
enemies on their rear-view

62
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,405
mirror mirrors.

63
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:26,473
Best case scenario around here,

64
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,475
in my humble opinion, taco

65
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,310
truck, of which there
are quite a few.

66
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,678
Parking lot, the smell of

67
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:39,679
mystery parts on a griddle, yes.

68
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,322
Knowing what I love of all

69
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,690
things Mexican, you might expect

70
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:48,127
me to be eating tacos
for the next hour.

71
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,329
Without the wide stance.

72
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,130
Damn you, tacos village.

73
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:59,131
Come for the vistas,
stay for the tacos.

74
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,047
30 rounds per magazine of

75
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:43,182
steel jacketed destruction as

76
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:51,183
fast as your finger
can pull the trigger.

77
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,393
You might well ask yourself, why

78
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:57,564
the hell would anybody
need a weapon like this?

79
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:59,566
The Ar-15 is one of the weapons

80
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,369
most reviled by gun opponents.

81
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,771
It's also America's
favorite rifle.

82
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,006
I never thought I'd say a guy

83
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,208
from New York is a natural when

84
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,843
it comes to shooting an Ar-15 in

85
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,412
new Mexico, but I'm impressed.

86
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,280
As a nation, we love them.

87
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,748
There are about four
million in circulation.

88
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,783
Those are the facts.

89
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:20,219
Basically, Ar-15 is a
semiautomatic civilian version

90
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,220
of an m-16.

91
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,423
The funny thing is that in

92
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,392
relation, this gun is almost

93
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:26,593
identical to this gun, but this

94
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,027
is the one that's evil.

95
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,028
Shoots the same caliber, the

96
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,464
same magazine capacity, just
looks a little different.

97
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,032
I'm an east coast guy.

98
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,033
I'm a new yorker.

99
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:37,404
But I come from a place where a

100
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,705
glimpse of a weapon on somebody

101
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:41,307
at a bar is reason for panic.

102
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,042
Here, in much of America in

103
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:43,811
between New York and L.A., you

104
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:46,546
walk into a bar, you see
somebody with a weapon, it's

105
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,416
like that's my neighbor,
maybe he's going hunting.

106
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:50,050
Who knows?

107
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:52,051
Most of the people
you know own guns?

108
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,621
Everybody I know.

109
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,423
I had a rifle before I
had a baseball bat.

110
00:05:56,424 --> 00:06:04,424
Meet Jesse, bill,
Bo, and Daniel.

111
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:06,734
Pretty much who we are talking

112
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:11,438
about when we see the latest
stats on gun purchases in

113
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:19,439
America and shake our
heads uncomprehendingly.

114
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,651
That cultural divide, much more

115
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,486
than policy, is what's kept the

116
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:31,491
issue of gun control so
polarized and so, frankly,

117
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:31,825
hopeless.

118
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,693
He had a gun before he
had a baseball bat.

119
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,662
I'm in the same situation.

120
00:06:34,663 --> 00:06:36,496
I was shooting a BB gun when I

121
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,097
was 5 years old and I knew at

122
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,365
that time it wasn't a toy, it

123
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,468
was a weapon, and I was very

124
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,470
well-educated by my father on

125
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,972
the responsible use of
that piece of equipment.

126
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,774
And that's what's
critical to me.

127
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,509
I shoot all the time and I'm

128
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,679
always trying to shoot
better than I did last week.

129
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,313
It's relaxing.

130
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,316
You're out with friends.

131
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:57,885
It's fun.

132
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:00,152
There's a dark little genie

133
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,154
in all of us, I think, that

134
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,524
wants to pick up a gun, point it

135
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,892
at something, and blast away.

136
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,628
This is a new Springfield arm

137
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,565
nine millimeter
with 19 round clip.

138
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:15,535
I like guns.

139
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:18,170
I don't own a gun, but
I like holding them.

140
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,206
I like shooting them.

141
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,809
A Glock .22.

142
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,812
It's cheaper than a 40 caliber.

143
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,146
There is something compelling

144
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,548
compelling, an eerie rush, a

145
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,517
sense of empowerment feeling the

146
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:34,554
warm glow of these heavy
iconic shapes in your hands.

147
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,590
Get off my lawn, you kids.

148
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,592
That's a 357 Magnum.

149
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,727
Bigger kick on this guy.

150
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,161
A little bit.

151
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,732
You just can't help silently
mouthing "make my day" or

152
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:53,733
"feeling lucky, punk."

153
00:07:56,777 --> 00:08:02,549
You could do this all day.

154
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,383
Whatever your opinion on the

155
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,586
subject, fact is, gun culture

156
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,621
runs deep in this country.

157
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,857
This is what I grew
up with, yeah.

158
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,192
I shot my very first Turkey with

159
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,962
this gun at 12 years
old, actually.

160
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,964
That's a 22 rim fire cartridge.

161
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,032
That is probably the type of

162
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,634
firearm that most
kids start off with.

163
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,636
These guys, I'm guessing, are

164
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,972
not people I should
be worried about.

165
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:26,574
They are nice.

166
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:28,608
And exceedingly patient with a

167
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:31,210
city boy who wants to
play with their guns.

168
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,113
That there is a 338
Winchester Magnum.

169
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,249
That's a big cartridge, heavy

170
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,886
bullet for very large
game like elk.

171
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,054
There's a target up
on that hillside.

172
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:46,425
Can you see it?

173
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,660
Now watch Mr. New York City

174
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,296
liberal shoot that target out

175
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,999
there from 244 wind-swept yards.

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,601
Oh, wow.

177
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:57,637
Now, am I accounting for windage

178
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,805
dropping with distance?

179
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:04,010
Yeah, you want to aim 13
millimeters to the left, four

180
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:08,015
millimeters high and
you'll hit dead-center.

181
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:08,749
Left?

182
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,483
No, hold it right on.

183
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,020
I'm just making a joke.

184
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:19,258
Taking advantage
of the city boy.

185
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,294
That wind's got to
be 20 miles an hour.

186
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:27,634
Holding the rifle in this

187
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,268
wind without a brace is tough.

188
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,171
All eyes are on
you, no pressure.

189
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,472
Pretty close, huh?

190
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:39,478
May have been a hair left.

191
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:47,053
A little high that
time, I think.

192
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,488
A little right.

193
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,290
Shooting real good,
though, Tony.

194
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,927
You're not missing it by much.

195
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,296
Exhale.

196
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:57,698
Squeeze.

197
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:02,068
The biggest thing is just
let it surprise you.

198
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,536
As you're pulling the
trigger, squeeze it slow.

199
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,505
Every time it goes off, it

200
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:12,511
should surprise you, that
way you don't flinch.

201
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,914
That looked right on.

202
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,549
That looked right on to me.

203
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,886
I'm proud of myself.

204
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,821
I was somewhere in
the neighborhood.

205
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,522
He's a natural.

206
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,757
You think people that don't

207
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,525
like the idea of guns, if they

208
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,761
had a day out here shooting

209
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,529
targets, I suspect a fair number

210
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,399
of them would at least
temper their views somewhat.

211
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,601
A thousand percent.

212
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,003
Absolutely.

213
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:36,704
You definitely get a respect

214
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:38,537
for the power of it, for sure.

215
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:42,541
Generally speaking, me and

216
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,776
these guys I think should feel

217
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,812
free to buy all
the guns we want.

218
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:51,117
It's the rest of you
I'm not so sure about.

219
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,919
Know how to shoot beer cans.

220
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,923
If the zombie apocalypse
comes, I'll be ready.

221
00:10:56,924 --> 00:11:01,261
As long as they're
holding beers.

222
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,755
So, when I grew up, when I

223
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:32,158
was a kid, I played
cowboys and Indians.

224
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,993
The cowboy myth had such a grip

225
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,796
on Americans' self-identity.

226
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:37,765
I remember.

227
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:38,831
Playing cowboys and Indians, it

228
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,232
was just part of the culture.

229
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:45,905
You looked up to John
Wayne, Steve McQueen.

230
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,406
My kid, 12 years old, wouldn't

231
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,241
even think about cowboys.

232
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,275
This is David.

233
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,277
His family has lived here for

234
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,478
generations, tracing their roots

235
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:56,916
all the way back to the
Spanish conquistador.

236
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,918
Those cliff walls out there,

237
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,286
Tony, are 160 million years old.

238
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:03,823
The ones at the
bottom, about 220.

239
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:08,694
They're all the way back
to the Triasic area.

240
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,831
And this is ghost ranch,
next door to David's spread.

241
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,665
This is the area where Georgia

242
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,634
O’Keeffe spent the last and most

243
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,870
productive decades of her life.

244
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,972
Now you've walked
through her painting.

245
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:24,510
This is what she
called my country.

246
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,679
Wasn't until my early 20s that I

247
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,215
even knew who Georgia
O’Keeffe was.

248
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:32,819
Grew up with her being
like a grandmother.

249
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,853
It took me going into a gallery

250
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,856
out there, I saw all
these paintings.

251
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,025
I said why have you got
pictures of my house?

252
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:42,228
She said please,
take a step back.

253
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,832
That's Georgia O'Keefe's.

254
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,167
It's just going to get prettier.

255
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:51,838
It's just going to get prettier.

256
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,309
One of O'Keefe's biographers
infamously described this

257
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,078
landscape as garish, vulgar, and

258
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,247
in poor taste, which if you look

259
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:07,153
around is pretty
hard to comprehend.

260
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,687
This is such the other side of

261
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:12,892
the universe for somebody
who lives like I do.

262
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:18,865
Live in cities, for whom
a backyard this big is

263
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:19,266
inconceivable.

264
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:20,499
The idea that there's a certain

265
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,334
type of personality who's drawn

266
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,170
towards open spaces like this.

267
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:27,073
You know, this country, it

268
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:35,074
either embraces you or within
a year it spits you out.

269
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,950
We reached the end of our

270
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,352
trail at a place called valley

271
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,521
of thieves, once said to be a

272
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:47,894
haven for infamous cattle
wrestlers, of course.

273
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:51,763
They call it the rabbit.

274
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,134
Ladies, you know what
I'm talking about.

275
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:59,305
Jesus, I'm in my 50s.

276
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,941
Find a distinguished segue into

277
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:09,315
adulthood one of these days.

278
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,551
Three generations are here
with me this evening.

279
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,586
Herman, David, and Max.

280
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,423
We'll do our best to put
together a little meal.

281
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:22,962
Anybody want some coffee?

282
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,797
Who am I kidding?

283
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:31,070
I'm a city boy.

284
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,273
Going to get all
Jack Palance here.

285
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,142
We're also joined by Dan Flores,

286
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:40,446
author of the book "horizontal

287
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:44,416
yellow: Nature and history
in the southwest."

288
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,852
How powerful are the
echoes from Spain?

289
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,189
Spain was in control of new
Mexico for far longer than

290
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:50,790
Mexico was.

291
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:55,027
I think a lot of these new
Mexican families are ten

292
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,628
generation and 11 generation.

293
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,597
When they look back on
themselves, they think of

294
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,101
themselves as Spanish.

295
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:06,172
Those traditions, they've
continued to thrive in these

296
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:06,974
little pockets.

297
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:07,975
We're cut off from Spain.

298
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:10,042
I once worked with people from

299
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,844
Spain and they kept cutting
up, snickering at me.

300
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,613
What they told me was okay, you

301
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:19,618
can knock it off with the
Don Quixote phraseology.

302
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,822
The equivalent of me today,

303
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:26,025
would be top of the
morning to you, sir.

304
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,226
They're like stop
making fun of us.

305
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,195
I said you know what?

306
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:29,695
I'm not making fun of you.

307
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:30,997
That's the way we speak.

308
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,032
We go see grandpa, that's all he

309
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,034
knows is 500 year ago Spanish.

310
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,869
Maybe if we're lucky enough,

311
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,838
we'll have grandpa play his

312
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,144
harmonica the way he used
to on the cattle drives.

313
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,213
But I have a plan
here on this meat.

314
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,880
All right, the meat is yours.

315
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:55,854
All right, good.

316
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,689
Just call me cooky.

317
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:05,690
Some local beef, glowing
hot coals, cast iron can.

318
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,871
Want to puree the
green chilies here?

319
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:13,240
Yes.

320
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,941
Beautiful.

321
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:16,876
I'm going to throw those chilies

322
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:19,945
in, stew it for a few
minutes, it will be good.

323
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:26,085
I just need a few
splashes of an open beer.

324
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:26,719
Beautiful.

325
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,087
Check it off the Chuck wagon

326
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,122
greatest hits, we've got some

327
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:34,126
beans, potatoes, corn bread.

328
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,461
We do our best.

329
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,763
This is just about ready.

330
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,731
Let's eat.

331
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,567
Dig in.

332
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:43,702
We done good, gentlemen.

333
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:44,104
No kidding.

334
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:44,704
Thank you, Tony.

335
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:45,305
This is excellent.

336
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:47,273
I'm wondering, you guys have

337
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,141
been here for so long, your

338
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,111
family, could you
live anywhere else?

339
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,479
Not me.

340
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,948
No, not me.

341
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:57,717
This is home.

342
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:59,285
I always get called back here.

343
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:04,756
I visited Paris and lived in L.A.
for a while.

344
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,158
Paris is pretty great.

345
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,226
It's pretty great.

346
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,960
But it's not here.

347
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:13,132
I'm curious to know why you
chose... why you came here

348
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:13,566
initially?

349
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,501
Open space.

350
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:15,767
Because I had grown up in a

351
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,604
circumstance where you
couldn't see 50 feet.

352
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,173
I mean, the forest was so dense.

353
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,176
I used to climb up into the top

354
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,112
of the tree on the highest hill

355
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:30,316
just to be able to
see over the forest.

356
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:31,084
So it was something about the

357
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,352
idea of being able to see the

358
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,254
landscape that
really compelled me.

359
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:41,360
The big empty makes a real

360
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:49,361
deep, deep sense to a
certain type of person.

00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,626
frontiersmen and hearty pioneers

366
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,229
have come to this unforgiving

367
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:31,230
landscape to eke out a
difficult existence.

368
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,072
Welcome to Santa Fe today.

369
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:37,075
Where we can all live the
western dream and even buy a

370
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:40,479
little piece of it to take home.

371
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,880
You gotta love it.

372
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,315
We pretty much eradicate the

373
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,950
native American culture, and now

374
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,652
in newer, more politically

375
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,454
correct times, we decide we love

376
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,590
Indians and all things
native American.

377
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:56,161
And we're kind of, but
not really sorry.

378
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,129
But that's not all.

379
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,897
The new west is inclusive.

380
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,666
Welcome to Santa Fe.

381
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,301
You've got a whole spectrum

382
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,303
of new age crystal types seeking

383
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,304
spiritual purity and intensity

384
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,574
in the harsh, yet
beautiful landscape.

385
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,409
It's the last place in the U.S.

386
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,280
You can wear buckskin and
fringe without irony.

387
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:22,281
While holding a
Buddhist blanket.

388
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,924
There is, very deep inside this

389
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,126
ordinary-looking five and dime,

390
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:36,127
something truly authentic.

391
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,937
Frito pie and a soda, please?

392
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,306
This is the Frito pie.

393
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,940
As American as apple pie or the

394
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:47,713
American project and
nearly as deadly.

395
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,316
His or her Mel chili and
cheese-like substance dropped

396
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,951
like a deuce, another roller in

397
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,955
the night, right into
a bag of fritos.

398
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:02,328
It feels like you're holding
warm crap in a bag.

399
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,963
If you closed your eyes and I

400
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,733
put this in your hand,
you'd be very worried.

401
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,168
Yet, it is also delicious.

402
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,571
Neither the Frito nor the Frito

403
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,440
pie were indigenous
to new Mexico.

404
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,175
They were actually Texan.

405
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,977
New Mexico, you have
many wonderful things.

406
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:23,749
Let Texas have this one.

407
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,418
Self-loathing that usually takes

408
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,555
a night of drinking to achieve.

409
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:37,556
Tequila drinking
and a strip club.

410
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,403
A warm, spreading glow fills my

411
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:48,407
belly as I set out once more
in my mighty Ford galaxy.

412
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:53,879
Yet I am also depressed.

413
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Frito pie.

414
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,416
I smell metaphor.

415
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:04,222
Speaking of explosive
diarrhea... did you know that

416
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:06,525
the first ever atomic bomb was

417
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:10,228
exploded in 1945 in the
desert of new Mexico?

418
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:17,436
Sushi bars, galleries,
massage studios.

419
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:17,704
Crystals?

420
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:21,306
We got 'em.

421
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:25,544
I think I need to adjust
my vent or something.

422
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,679
I just see dark portents
in all of this.

423
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,751
Well, there are a lot
of dark portents.

424
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:38,624
This food will lighten
you up, I guarantee you.

425
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,426
Horseman's haven cafe sits

426
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,093
next to a gas station that is

427
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,829
about as far away if the Plaza

428
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,431
as you can get without leaving

429
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:48,634
the Santa Fe city limits.

430
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:52,838
It has a special feel of

431
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,440
chilies grown specifically for

432
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,908
this restaurant
and nowhere else.

433
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:01,447
I meet back up with Dan
Flores for historical

434
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:04,082
perspective over Santa Fe’s most

435
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:04,851
beloved new Mexican fare.

436
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:10,489
I know people who have
journeyed 300 or 400 miles to

437
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,490
eat here.

438
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,660
Enchilada with carne.

439
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,962
Pork in reddened Mexican chili

440
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:18,096
sauce with beans and rice.

441
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,297
Got to have that.

442
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:27,298
Some pasole, a stew made
from soaked hominy and pork.

443
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:31,510
And sopapilla.

444
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,378
Early cattle, railroad men, the

445
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,680
people on their way to making

446
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:38,116
this America, were they romantic

447
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:38,851
about this part of the world?

448
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:39,951
They thought of it
as a hard place.

449
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:47,952
For one thing, it was
exceedingly remote.

450
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:50,128
When you were here, this seemed

451
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,965
like one of the farthest
reaches of the globe.

452
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:58,504
Initially, Americans began
coming here because they

453
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:01,339
perceived that Santa Fe was so

454
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,710
remote from the rest of the
Spanish empire that it was

455
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:06,812
possible for the United
States to pluck it.

456
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:08,547
I don't think anybody becomes a

457
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:13,351
romantic about it probably
until the painters arrive.

458
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:17,823
Starting a long-running
tradition of artistic

459
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,157
pilgrimages to catch the

460
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:22,360
spiritual groove, every kind of

461
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,530
utopian dreamer, eccentric, new

462
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:29,034
ager, they all came here
in search of whatever.

463
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:32,838
Mmm, chilies.

464
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,373
That's level three.

465
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:35,642
All right.

466
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:37,008
We will be careful.

467
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,410
New Mexican chilies come in

468
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,013
two varieties... red or green.

469
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,382
That's the state question in
new Mexico, red or green.

470
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,951
Ordinarily, I like green.

471
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:47,553
It's like Yankees or Mets.

472
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:48,587
You've got to pick one.

473
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:52,390
This green, however,
is not ordinary green.

474
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:55,627
My face is burning off.

475
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:56,596
This ain't normal.

476
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:58,564
Oh, god.

477
00:24:58,565 --> 00:24:59,565
This hurts.

478
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:00,966
I'm going to join you.

479
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:05,771
Def-con one, two, three.

480
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,272
It's a slow roll.

481
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:11,577
First you think it's
going to be okay.

482
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,078
Then it's not.

483
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:19,818
There's nothing you can
do but wait it out.

484
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:25,657
I believe they use the same
peppers in pepper spray.

485
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,293
Or repelling grizzly bears.

486
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:31,730
A shot glass of that will
put you in the hospital.

487
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:32,498
No kidding.

488
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:34,232
Everybody in the
restaurant seems so calm.

489
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,601
Maybe they're not eating this.

490
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:38,437
They're muffling their screams.

491
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:53,619
History, they say,
belongs to the Victors.

492
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,453
And here, where the myth of the

493
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:56,922
American west took root, where

494
00:25:56,923 --> 00:26:00,325
so much romantic lore began,

495
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,627
history was being rewritten

496
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:03,662
almost as soon as it happened.

497
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,263
This was never the big empty.

498
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,666
As Dan Flores writes the idea of

499
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:12,838
a wilderness is itself
a cultural construct.

500
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:18,276
As early as 1539 when a
Franciscan friar reported

501
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,511
sighting from a distance what he

502
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,114
called the seven cities of

503
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,850
cibola, these were interpreted

504
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:29,721
as outposts of wealth,
possible cities of gold.

505
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,690
Coronado, the famous Spanish

506
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:32,958
conquistador, quickly dispatched

507
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:40,959
an expedition and there
were indeed cities.

508
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:46,673
Thank you for having us.

509
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:50,575
The home of community
leader Ivan Pino.

510
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,078
I'm here to join him and his

511
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,781
nephew Robert and family
in a traditional hunt.

512
00:26:55,782 --> 00:27:03,782
So we'll be carrying
our shotguns.

513
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:07,693
It's harder.

514
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:11,529
It's always good to get a

515
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,699
prayer going so that the animals

516
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:21,700
can be willing to
take their life.

517
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:29,915
The pueblo who lived here

518
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,382
continuously since around 1250

519
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,918
a.d. Had long before the Spanish

520
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,721
or anyone else arrived a
highly organized society.

521
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:38,423
They built multi-level
adobe apartment blocks.

522
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,791
They farmed the land.

523
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,727
Irrigated crops using intricate

524
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,594
water diversion systems.

525
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:50,435
All this in what sure as hell
looked like a harsh, and

526
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:56,241
unforgiving land.

527
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,776
This is good weather, though,

528
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,811
for hunting because it's
a nice breeze, overcast.

529
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:00,946
The breeze is beautiful.

530
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:05,650
Not too hot.

531
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:09,955
Pueblo long ago learned to
adapt to hard times, dry

532
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,790
seasons, war, incursion.

533
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,458
There were years where
there was nothing.

534
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:16,795
And they had to deal.

535
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,629
We found a pack rat.

536
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,399
Our first pack rat.

537
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,969
In preparation for the summer

538
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,805
solstice ceremony, game like
rabbits and pack rats are

539
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:27,839
collected for the medicine man

540
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,075
as a payment for his services.

541
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,810
How you notice is there's

542
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,411
some droppings, fresh droppings.

543
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,914
You see the droppings, you
know there's one around.

544
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:37,282
This time of the day, they're

545
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,649
going to be inside their homes.

546
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,485
There's too many
predators around.

547
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:41,020
It's not easy.

548
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:45,924
Once you find a nest, you got to

549
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:50,528
dig after the little
burrowing bastards.

550
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:54,833
You hack, you dig.

551
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,802
You dig some more.

552
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:59,170
A lot of work for
a small rodent.

553
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:03,942
I was just thinking that.

554
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,044
That's what our ancestors
had to do sometimes.

555
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:07,645
Right now there's this
drought going on.

556
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:11,850
If we didn't have the
grocery stores... right.

557
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:15,954
Then hopefully when you
flush one cleanly...

558
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,688
Got it right here.

559
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,657
Right.

560
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:20,826
And give him a good
whack on the head.

561
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:27,032
The ratio of work to protein.

562
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:33,038
It's whiskers.

563
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,840
To ensure a generation of

564
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:37,508
this once vital source of food,

565
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,079
tradition and ritual requires

566
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,081
returning a part of the
animal back to the nest.

567
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:50,688
I will never go hungry.

568
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,091
Going for pack rats is really

569
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:55,260
an homage, an acknowledgement of

570
00:29:55,261 --> 00:30:00,899
an important earlier time
when that was all there was.

571
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,700
The 25-year great drought.

572
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,769
As a city boy, I am greatly

573
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,704
relieved these little critters

574
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:07,505
are for the medicine man and we

575
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,107
won't actually be
eating any of them.

576
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:11,910
Instead, Linda, Ivan's wife, is

577
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,378
preparing a pretty
traditional menu.

578
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:16,547
Nothing is wasted when our
game is brought home.

579
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:21,352
We dry up and
dehydrate the bone.

580
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,188
Deer bone stew, red chili

581
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,590
bone cooked with dried elk and

582
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:30,095
potatoes, roasted dried
corn, and tortillas.

583
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:33,098
And of course, more chilies.

584
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:37,302
We call this disturb
pusharound chili.

585
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,737
You push around until you
see the one you want.

586
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:44,809
The chilies are a
state of magical.

587
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,311
The seed has been passed on

588
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:47,745
from generation to generation.

589
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,314
They stay within the families.

590
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:52,783
What percentage of young
people leave and don't come

591
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,052
back?

592
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:55,820
Not too many people will leave.

593
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:56,555
Really?

594
00:30:56,556 --> 00:30:57,956
There are people who leave,

595
00:30:57,957 --> 00:30:59,925
but eventually there's this

596
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:00,959
yearning inside you that you

597
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,327
want to go home, you want to

598
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,594
learn your culture, you want to

599
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,762
be a part of everything.

600
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,331
It would be an understatement

601
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:08,333
to say the first Europeans who

602
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:11,336
came into contact with Indians

603
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,138
was destructive to the culture.

604
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:17,142
And given that history,
how American do you feel?

605
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:19,777
This village is unique in

606
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,947
that we can easily just ignore

607
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,581
everything that happens out

608
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,350
there and just keep to ourselves

609
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:26,952
here, and we do that sometimes.

610
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:28,153
We close the road and we take

611
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:29,787
care of our own business here.

612
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,622
But it really varies
by individual.

613
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,024
Maybe even by generation.

614
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:35,360
We have a veteran, a veteran, a

615
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,595
veteran that all served
in our armed forces.

616
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:40,798
A big tradition of
serving in the military.

617
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,967
Yes.

618
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:45,103
We continue to be outdoorsmen.

619
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:45,972
And we are survivors.

620
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:48,206
I've dealt with the elements of

621
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:52,043
the dust, the rain, the hail.

622
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:54,445
But it made a better
person out of me.

623
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:55,446
We are who we are.

624
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,917
We're still going to be here.

625
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:28,513
UFO activity.

626
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:30,715
I don't need to be looking out

627
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:37,088
my window to understand
they're behaving strangely.

628
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:42,927
Injuries from the crash.

629
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:50,928
Taken out into the desert
and they were buried.

630
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,679
Look up in the dark, the

631
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,515
night sky, uncontaminated by the

632
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:09,087
light of any nearby cities,
you can see things.

633
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,456
And of course, you've got a rich

634
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:14,259
tradition of actual, real life

635
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,061
spooky science fiction stuff.

636
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:18,296
The Manhattan project in Los

637
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:20,531
Alamos, nuclear missile silos

638
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,733
hidden deep beneath
the desert floor.

639
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:23,469
It's out there.

640
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,104
So, where are we?

641
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:28,073
Ground zero of where
everything seems to have

642
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:28,574
started.

643
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:31,476
Submitted for your approval.

644
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:33,111
Norio and his friend James, two

645
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:34,080
men associated with the new

646
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:38,083
Mexico UFO and paranormal forum.

647
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:43,288
This is where America's
rocketry actually started.

648
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,090
At the end of world war ii,

649
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:47,158
classified units of the CIA and

650
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,493
army intelligence were busy

651
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,928
sandbagging and sneaking away

652
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,599
from probable prosecution,

653
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,135
cadres of the world's
rocket scientists.

654
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,769
Did I mention they were Nazis?

655
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,107
Oh yeah, many of them
were sent around here.

656
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,974
Other very mysterious things

657
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:08,146
even took place,
allegedly, in 1947.

658
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,514
1947, Roswell incident.

659
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,116
That's right.

660
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:11,949
That's still a mystery.

661
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,751
Some say.

662
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:15,586
You notice how they always say

663
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:22,960
that in those dubious cheaply
reenacted doc shows.

664
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:27,031
Back then they were working
on some pretty cool stuff.

665
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:32,970
For instance, a Mylar-like
weather balloon.

666
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,973
They would pancake out
like a flying saucer.

667
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:38,276
Might that explain the excessive

668
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:40,211
zeal and mysterious behaviors?

669
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:42,780
If one of these things crashed
in the desert, you can

670
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,184
understand a whole bunch of

671
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,818
sinister-looking
bodies would show up.

672
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:52,157
It's hard to say, but any

673
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:54,192
military could create a
cover story for anything.

674
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:57,862
Any pocket of, like,
cyborgs or aliens?

675
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:01,199
I heard that there is and
then I've heard there isn't.

676
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,867
We're taking you to a place,

677
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:07,205
an undisclosed location, what's

678
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,574
known as Albuquerque's
own area 51.

679
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,142
There will be no
probing involved.

680
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,577
Every time there's, like, alien

681
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:13,811
stuff, there's always probing.

682
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:14,845
Always with the probing.

683
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:15,581
I don't understand.

684
00:35:15,582 --> 00:35:19,016
If they've been coming here for

685
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:26,224
years, haven't they
done enough probing?

686
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:30,395
If you were like on ghost
adventures, you'd be really

687
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:31,596
playing this up.

688
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:35,833
Some say this area was used
for sinister experiments,

689
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:40,271
German-speaking cyborgs.

690
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,240
Crack pot science.

691
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,108
This is even better
than area 51.

692
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,610
This is like area 61.

693
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,845
Area 61 turns out to be a fenced

694
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,881
off view of essentially
Kirkland air force base.

695
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,252
The leading edge military
research development and

696
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:54,553
testing.

697
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:56,487
At night, there's
a lot of lights.

698
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,223
It's a huge complex.

699
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:00,525
Fact is, there was and still

700
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:01,859
is some pretty cool stuff being

701
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,363
tested out there in the desert.

702
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:09,066
Maybe for DARPA or NSA
or the air force.

703
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,435
Who knows?

704
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:12,270
Do you think there are other

705
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,639
life forms among us who
visited this planet?

706
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,873
Yes, I do.

707
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:16,874
What do you think?

708
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:24,081
Well, personally, I have
a different opinion.

709
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,150
It's a whole cover story in

710
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,152
order to conceal certain kinds

711
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,087
of projects, but I
could be wrong.

712
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:35,893
I try to be a realist but
I'm open to anything.

713
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,262
What is for certain and has

714
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:39,330
been documented on film is that

715
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,899
somewhere out there among the

716
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,401
silos, underground cities,

717
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:46,103
supposed nuclear waste dumps and

718
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,105
alien burial ground, there is a

719
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:52,910
large animal and a
hole in the ground.

720
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,345
What strange beast even now is

721
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:57,315
being loaded into a grave size

722
00:36:57,316 --> 00:37:01,820
pit in the desert for me?

723
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:32,350
Well, I think one of the

724
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,819
first things any society learns

725
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,357
to do is dig a hole, throw
an animal in it, cook it.

726
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,960
They call it around
here a matanza.

727
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,463
One, two, three, up, up, up.

728
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:48,999
It's pretty much an old-school
version of a barbecue

729
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,968
in the sense that it involves

730
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,372
burying a pig and the
imbibing of much alcohol.

731
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,740
About 20 minutes from the

732
00:37:55,741 --> 00:38:02,347
nearest paved road
is dead horse ranch.

733
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:05,182
People who made it has no

734
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:09,354
shortage gathered to partake
in the festivities.

735
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:10,988
There is beer here.

736
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,757
Plenty of it, loelg
and delicious.

737
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:13,559
And abundant.

738
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,261
Did I say that?

739
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,196
Have a drink.

740
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,031
There are very tasty and lethal

741
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,000
as it turns out margaritas and I

742
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,669
believe to the best of my

743
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,204
recollection anyway that I soon

744
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,374
made the classic error of moving

745
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:32,009
from margaritas of straight

746
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,044
shots of Tequila and makes it

747
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,780
easier to meet new people.

748
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:39,517
Why is it that any time an alien

749
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:43,253
visits like America, there's
always anal penetration

750
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:43,522
involved.

751
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:44,456
I never heard it before.

752
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:46,290
Really?

753
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:46,892
Ever.

754
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:48,092
Am I into that?

755
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,461
But the pig, the pig.

756
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:58,462
What about that
body in the desert?

757
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:07,645
For the last 17 hours.

758
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:09,480
It looks delicious.

759
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,048
Frank here he knows.

760
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:15,119
He runs poncho's barbecue.

761
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,421
Time to get slicing.

762
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:19,624
I step in, help frank break my

763
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:23,461
piggy friend down into
his constituent parts.

764
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:23,795
Beautiful.

765
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:26,831
First off go the legs, what
you call your fresh ham.

766
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,332
Then your four quarter, your

767
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:32,069
shoulders and what happen not.

768
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,473
The loyal and rib
section, the pork belly.

769
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:40,578
Nothing goes to waste.

770
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,347
All that pig parts sent down the

771
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,483
line to Harold who's been using

772
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:52,590
them for new Mexico specialties.

773
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:57,528
Now our 300-pound friend, none

774
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:02,867
will go to waste, picked up with

775
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,536
pisole, going into chili.

776
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,705
Oh, yeah, that's going
to be beautiful.

777
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,940
The tenderloin I set aside for a

778
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,341
little time on the grill.

779
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:16,514
Everyone here has put
in a lot of work.

780
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:17,115
Time to eat.

781
00:40:17,116 --> 00:40:19,884
I didn't know the show was about

782
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,886
this but I've been
thinking about it a lot.

783
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:27,525
This sort of cowboys, Mexican,
Indian, romantic idea.

784
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:29,393
A lot of easterners fell in love

785
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,128
with this romantic notion of the

786
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,497
west and wanted to come out here

787
00:40:32,498 --> 00:40:37,167
and sort of create their
own version of the west.

788
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,570
Was that a good thing?

789
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:44,909
That's what helps us as a
people, a native culture.

790
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,579
We invite you to come and
enjoy what we partake in.

791
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,815
I mean the Indians have the

792
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:52,717
beans and the chili and corn and

793
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:53,751
Spanish people brought the pork

794
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,920
and brought that together
and have this meal here.

795
00:40:55,921 --> 00:41:00,157
People love the native culture,
they love the Hispanic

796
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,026
culture here.

797
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:02,560
It wasn't always that
way when I was younger.

798
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:06,597
You played cowboys and
Indians as a kid.

799
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:12,837
If there is one iconic hero
it is the lone cowboy.

800
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,038
Any resonance.

801
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,007
Mexican, Spanish, pueblo,

802
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:20,410
reservation, white, we
all are cowboys here.

803
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,848
A am a native new Mexican.

804
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:25,382
I have gone through strange

805
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:28,385
phases of my ownership of this

806
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:31,388
place, weird mixed bag and
that is the identity.

807
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:31,957
I don't know.

808
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:34,258
It allows a certain freedom.

809
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:40,230
My desire to wear cowboy
boots and wear a hat, you're

810
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:40,632
okay with that.

811
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:44,034
I would like to put my curse

812
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:47,071
word kicking boots and a hat.

813
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:47,639
Very kind of.

814
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,039
You I got a question for you.

815
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,976
What do you think of new Mexico?

816
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:54,278
Kind of what are your thoughts?

817
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:57,982
I'll try to boil it down
to a simple statement.

818
00:41:57,983 --> 00:42:00,651
If you come out to new Mexico

819
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,986
you see metaphors in everything

820
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:03,487
but actually if you were to

821
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:05,055
stretch a little bit you could

822
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:10,628
say that new Mexico is a
perfect metaphor for America.

823
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:11,062
♪

824
00:42:11,063 --> 00:42:13,798
It is a total mutation.

825
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:20,504
It's got Spanish, Mexican,
original American and add a

826
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:23,608
tinge of radioactivity.

827
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:25,676
This is what America is.

828
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:29,313
An immigrant culture,
we are a gun culture.

829
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:31,115
The expression of American power

830
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,650
and identity has always been the

831
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:34,685
lone cowboy with a gun.

832
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:35,486
That goes deep.

833
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:38,022
This is the heart of the

834
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:45,797
American dream, love it
or hate it, this is it.
