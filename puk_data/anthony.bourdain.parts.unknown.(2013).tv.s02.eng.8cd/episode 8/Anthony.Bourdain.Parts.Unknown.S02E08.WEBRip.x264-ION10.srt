Detroit's the city of champions.

The whole world knows that
Detroit is the American city

00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:22,882
whose products have
revolutionized our way of living.

4
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,457
And only in Michigan, when you

5
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,826
find the men and women whose

6
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,895
talent made us the arsenal of

7
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:36,669
democracy in wartime and the
economic pace-setter in

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:44,378
peacetime.

American and great came from.

The things the whole
world wanted made here.

20
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:40,300
The heart, the soul, the beat of

21
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,535
an industrial,
cultural superpower.

22
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,204
A magnet for everyone with a

00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,406
dream of a better future, from

24
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:49,542
eastern Europe to
the deep south.

25
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,212
American dream, you came here.

26
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:54,046
The one straight ahead
with the green roof?

27
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,283
The big building,
completely empty.

28
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,650
Empty?

29
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:57,985
Unbelievable.

30
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:59,786
The white one is being rehabbed.

31
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:00,820
There's some money coming in.

32
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:04,157
The one next to it on the
right is completely empty.

33
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:07,093
The gray pyramid with the spire

34
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:07,695
on top sold for $5 million.

35
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:09,162
$5 million for that?

36
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:10,930
You can't buy a garage in the

37
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,098
Hamptons for that basically.

38
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,535
$5 million for a skyscraper.

39
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,070
It's post-apocalyptic.

40
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,439
It's like a science
fiction film.

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,673
What the hell happened here?

42
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,742
Well, it is post-apocalyptic

43
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,277
except for the fact that there's

44
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,747
several hundred thousand
people living here.

45
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,382
Detroit 2013.

46
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,118
Charlie la duff is a writer,

47
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,420
journalist, television reporter.

48
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,521
He grew up here.

49
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:37,224
But it used to be
two million people.

50
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:38,791
That was rubber.

51
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,227
That guy was steel.

52
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:42,094
That guy was a doctor.

53
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,464
This was what made America.

54
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,699
The road started here.

55
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,800
The automobile.

56
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,135
Frozen peas started here.

57
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,404
Credit on a mass
scale started here.

58
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,940
What was this like
just before this?

59
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,708
20 years before.

60
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,743
It was insane.

61
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:59,446
And this is when it was like
twice as many people here.

62
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:00,880
This is a consequence because

63
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,249
all the whites went, they took

64
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,884
their money, they
took their factories.

65
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,220
The black middle class
maintained for a while.

66
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,822
And then it got too
rough for them.

67
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,824
So there's little pockets of

68
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,826
Ferrell hippies and older black

69
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,496
folks, a couple white
folks and Arabs.

70
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:18,831
But this is 140 square miles.

71
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,600
So you're going to get grass

72
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,734
because it's back to the wire.

73
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,837
It is one of the most
beautiful cities in America.

74
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:29,008
It speaks of those industrialite

75
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,143
dreams of an endlessly
glorious future.

76
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,645
The people who built these

77
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,913
structures, they
were thinking big.

78
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:34,682
They were.

79
00:03:34,683 --> 00:03:39,151
They were looking at a new
Rome and they built it,

80
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,755
actually.

81
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:50,756
It's awesome.

82
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:21,186
♪

83
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,747
Maybe the worm started
to come here.

84
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:44,551
The Packard automotive plant.

85
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,586
Opened in 1903, it was
considered the most advanced

86
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,721
facility of its kind
anywhere in the world.

87
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,157
Huge, especially proportioned.

88
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:55,595
I mean, 3.35 million
square feet.

89
00:04:55,596 --> 00:05:00,433
Now, one man lives here.

90
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:01,369
Al hill.

91
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,570
My name is Alan hill.

92
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,838
Welcome to my home.

93
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,442
This room right here was a
former Packard motor car

94
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:09,710
company.

95
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:14,714
I started living here
about seven years ago.

96
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,717
I was semi apprehensive
about the goings on here.

97
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,620
But turns out it's about as
peaceful as the north woods.

98
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,888
Not having a credit card or

99
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,124
mortgage payment or car
payment is a real blessing.

100
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,393
There's a few nails here.

101
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,127
Yeah.

102
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:28,761
So what's happened here in

103
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:35,402
Detroit is unfortunate, but
it's a sign of the times.

104
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,303
We find out it takes an entire

105
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,238
world to support one city.

106
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,642
One city is suffering or one
community is suffering, the

107
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,310
entire world should pitch in and

108
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:52,251
help elevate it instead of
sit there and stare at it.

109
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,722
People have lost faith
in a lot of things.

110
00:05:55,723 --> 00:06:00,827
Probably had to do with the
faith they had in Detroit.

111
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,796
Once the industrial leader
of the entire world.

112
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:04,665
It's enormous.

113
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,299
Yeah, it is.

114
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,403
A mile long, maybe a
quarter of a mile wide.

115
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,138
I've got a pretty good
view from up here.

116
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,973
Yeah.

117
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,442
How many people worked
here at its peak?

118
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:16,843
During the war, there were

119
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,778
like 33,000 people working here.

120
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,681
It went out of business in '56.

121
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,683
Brought Studebaker in as a

122
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,518
partner and Studebaker
pulled them down.

123
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,855
This has been abandoned
since the '50s?

124
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:32,191
Actually, what happened, in

125
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,261
1956, they rent out to
various entrepreneurs.

126
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:38,465
Truck and companies,
guys were storing cars.

127
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:42,001
So how long has it
been like this?

128
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,036
Most of this damage happened
in the last five years.

129
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,171
Within the last five years?

130
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:45,839
Yeah.

131
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,708
China had this Olympia effort.

132
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,109
Scrap metal went
to a high price.

133
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,479
They took the windows out, they

134
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,515
just destroyed everything.

135
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,450
The place is pretty much open

136
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,885
to anybody who wants to come in.

137
00:06:58,886 --> 00:06:59,319
Sure.

138
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,187
A lot of urban explorers.

139
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:04,223
People shooting music
videos, taking pictures.

140
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,392
Oftentimes you see a
wedding party come here.

141
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,127
And they use this as a backdrop

142
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:11,998
for their wedding and
take pictures, videos.

143
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,500
Wow.

144
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:16,235
You want to take pictures here.

145
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,671
The place, like so much
of Detroit, invites it.

146
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,372
Urban exploring, as they call

147
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,676
it, sifting through the remains

148
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:27,680
of Detroit's great ongoing
American tragedy,

149
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:31,851
photographing them, posing
in front of them is an

150
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:32,185
impulse.

151
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:32,686
Detroiters hate it.

152
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:35,755
All the visitors like us, I

153
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,857
point out, wallowing in ruin.

154
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,559
Where are we standing?

155
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,095
This right here is where
the assembly line was.

156
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,765
This is a paint booth where
they spray paint the cars.

157
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,934
You can see on the car where

158
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,736
they have the washer
with the spray.

159
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:53,906
The assembly line ended
35, 40 feet over here.

160
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:58,210
There's Bridges between
here in the main building.

161
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:02,281
Actually came
across the Bridges.

162
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,017
Assembly line three
quarters of a mile long.

163
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,252
You're talking hundreds of

164
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,287
thousands of people all
working on the process.

165
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,189
This is sort of a... it's not a

166
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,558
perfect model for Detroit, but a

167
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:12,959
perfect model of when a big

168
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,361
factory goes down, it's
not just 33,000 people.

169
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,030
That's 33,000 families who are

170
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,267
going to be eating
dinner out less.

171
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:27,439
You've got a point
there on that.

172
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,308
Most people I would guess

173
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,644
have no idea what a
Packard even was.

174
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,812
We're talking about one of the

175
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,581
great luxury cars
in the world, yes?

176
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,816
It was the kind of car that

177
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,250
everybody would love to have.

178
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:43,990
Kings and queens, every president
wanted to ride in one.

179
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,925
Popes and Indian chiefs.

180
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:49,261
A luxury car maker
went out of business.

181
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,462
Little did they realize that was

182
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,332
a trend that started here in

183
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,967
Detroit and when it affected

184
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,503
Detroit, it affected the entire

185
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,671
world because it
followed everybody home.

186
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,907
50 or 60 years later, but it

187
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,009
started here and then everybody

188
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,845
else experienced the same
problem that we're having.

189
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:09,849
Another 20 years, this place
probably won't be here and

190
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,183
people won't have any idea
what went on over here.

191
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,786
It's hard to look
away from the ruin.

192
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:18,858
To not find beauty in the decay.

193
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:25,632
Comparisons to Anchorwatt,
ancient Rome are inevitable.

194
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:26,833
Magnificent structures
representing the boundless

195
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:30,269
Greens of the dead left to rot.

196
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:37,376
Yet unlike anchor,
people still live here.

197
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,478
We forget that.

198
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,148
You tell people you go to
Detroit, and chances are

199
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,549
somebody from the home team is

200
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,485
going to say "be sure
to get a coney."

201
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,687
I never really understood that.

202
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,388
I mean, I'm like 30 minutes from

203
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:53,225
a place called coney island
where presumably, they know

204
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,395
something about freaking
hot dogs, right?

205
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,565
Maybe the early Greeks
or Macedonians who first

206
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,633
experienced that golden land by

207
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:05,504
the shore then took what they
saw with them to Florida,

208
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,739
Michigan, and beyond.

209
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,242
Maybe they knew something.

210
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,545
They've been doing coneys at
duly's for over 90 years.

211
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,849
That's almost as long as
the hotdog's been around.

212
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,653
I can't tell you how deep
this creation runs here.

213
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,588
Deep dish in Chicago,
cheesesteak in Philadelphia.

214
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,590
You'll find some ambivalence.

215
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,225
Not here.

216
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:26,425
How are you, sir?

217
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,094
Good.

218
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:28,761
Now, if I were from Detroit,

219
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,397
would I be eating this with
my hands or with a fork?

220
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,564
Probably with your hands.

221
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,266
All right.

222
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:37,870
I'll do my best.

223
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,538
Logistical problems.

224
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,340
That's delicious.

225
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:47,179
This is the best of my only
three coney experiences.

226
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,414
You're open 24 hours.

227
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,917
Yes, sir, 24/7.

228
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,551
The lunch crowd, seriously

229
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,020
drunk people trying to eat this.

230
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,122
We have a fun time.

231
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,356
A skill you learn overtime?

232
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,925
It takes practice.

233
00:10:58,926 --> 00:10:59,959
It's like kung fu.

234
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,694
You've got to practice
and practice.

235
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:02,562
Exactly.

236
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:06,198
Practice makes perfect.

237
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,233
That's good.

238
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,868
I think I better have
another one of these.

239
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,136
Yeah, you should.

240
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,739
I'll be better at it
the next time around.

241
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,973
One coney with everything.

242
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:17,376
It seems like a simple thing.

243
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,612
Hotdog, chili, raw onion,
mustard, steamed bun.

244
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,114
But the delicate interplay

245
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:28,121
between these ingredients
when done right is symphonic.

246
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,465
Detroit's problems
are well-documented.

247
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,934
A lot of attention has been paid

248
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:18,771
to a history of spectacular

249
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,106
mismanagement and corruption.

250
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:25,611
Detroit is hardly alone in this.

251
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,347
New York was a pit
of corruption.

252
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:32,318
Chicago, Boston, machine
politics, they wrote the book.

253
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:36,455
But Detroit differs in that its

254
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:44,456
scandal seems so squalid.

255
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,467
Through all of it, one man seems

256
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,237
to have known what's going on.

257
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:55,041
Adolph Mongo, political
strategist, oracle, survivor.

258
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,009
He's seen it all.

259
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:01,313
I know what I'm having,
but I'd love a beer.

260
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,149
I thought you drank, man.

261
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,051
You drinking beer?

262
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,485
What are you drinking?

263
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:11,090
I'm drinking vodka.

264
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,091
I'll fold under pressure.

265
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:12,725
Okay.

266
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,494
Then I'll think about a
burger down the way.

267
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:19,665
You having something to eat?

268
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,267
I'll hold back.

269
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:28,174
I will stick with...
I'll get you your drink.

270
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:32,744
Thank you.

271
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,346
I have to ask, you're born and

272
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,547
raised in the Detroit area.

273
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,351
An academic star.

274
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,553
Marine corps.

275
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:41,855
Journalism.

276
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:43,255
Why did you never
run for office?

277
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,091
You got to be crazy.

278
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:45,758
You know what?

279
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,527
They don't want straight
forward politicians.

280
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,296
They don't last.

281
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:51,763
You got to be real cold-blooded.

282
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,699
Men are elected officials like

283
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,368
working for the drug cartel.

284
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,870
You can't get anybody any mercy.

285
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,106
It seems that whatever might

286
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,241
be in your heart and however

287
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:05,377
pure you might be, when you
finally arrive in office,

288
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,546
somebody brings you a big

289
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,281
dossier and opens it up and says

290
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:12,218
Mr. President, Mr. Mayor, Mr.

291
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,086
Governor, this is
the real situation.

292
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,387
At which point it's an ocean

293
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:20,292
trying to start making some
serious accommodations.

294
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,428
Yes.

295
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,965
Kwame Kilpatrick.

296
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,133
Greedy.

297
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,234
He was greedy.

298
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,002
I didn't support him
in the beginning.

299
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,671
And I was one of his
biggest critics.

300
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,807
But when he got in
trouble, who he call?

301
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,743
He called me.

302
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,745
I should have
listened to my wife.

303
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,580
She said don't be
messing with him.

304
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,849
Are there good guys out there?

305
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,851
There's a lot of guys, yes.

306
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,286
But they don't want to run.

307
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,487
There's a lot of people.

308
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,989
Why don't they want to run?

309
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,324
Because you've got to take

310
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,926
the badge that come
along with it.

311
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:58,797
You got to take the garbage.

312
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,766
Why should a bright young guy

313
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,935
fresh out of law school start
thinking about running for

314
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,670
anything in the city of Detroit?

315
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,772
Sooner or later, it's
going to be all right.

316
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:07,607
It's going to be all right.

317
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:10,309
It's a tough town.

318
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,444
Is Detroit going to
turn things around?

319
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,880
I could lie and tell you yes.

320
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:15,782
But you know what?

321
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:17,883
This city is screwed.

322
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,618
Only place I've ever been that

323
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:24,056
looks anything like Detroit
does now, Chernobyl.

324
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,458
I'm not being funny.

325
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,194
That's the truth.

326
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,228
Abandoned.

327
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:34,000
But you have to admire the
bold, proud, ferociously

328
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,567
enterprising survivivors who

329
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,503
decided to hang on, hang in, and

330
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:42,174
figure out a way to not only
survive, but do something

331
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,309
extraordinary.

332
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,146
There's Tyree's Hidelburg
project, a loony outdoor

333
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,380
community art project that began

334
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,217
in 1986 and now attracts 35,000

335
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:58,991
visitors per year from
around the world.

336
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,859
That was a buck in
gas right there.

337
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,663
I love Detroit.

338
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,765
They got this in the summer,

339
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:11,370
the neighborhood lit it on fire.

340
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,372
Another block and more decay.

341
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,841
And a liquor store.

342
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,944
This neighborhood, the
only store for miles.

343
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:22,614
Just be right back.

344
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:26,552
How you doing?

345
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,919
Hey.

346
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,555
I love you.

347
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,390
Awesome spirit on you, man.

348
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,025
God bless you.

349
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:34,193
Hi, how are you?

350
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:38,130
Ain't nobody do it like you.

351
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,698
See you later.

352
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:46,538
Cheers, man.

353
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:50,476
You want one?

354
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:53,445
That's the benefit of a college
education right there.

355
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,081
People seem to like
you in this town.

356
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,415
Who hates you in this town?

357
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,883
Who hates me in this town?

358
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:58,718
Nobody.

359
00:16:58,718 --> 00:16:59,486
Politicians?

360
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:00,886
I'm guessing there are a

361
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,055
number of politicians and former

362
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,157
public employees who
are not too happy.

363
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,893
I don't know.

364
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:08,960
You know, yeah.

365
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:09,961
Let's face it.

366
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,297
There's a whole lot of people

367
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:12,564
out there who would be perfectly

368
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,467
happy with just
letting Detroit go.

369
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:18,570
It already went!

370
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,472
Look at this.

371
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:20,972
See those lilies there?

372
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,075
I call those the ghost gardens.

373
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,943
Like they're all over like the

374
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:32,944
houses that used to be, the
gardens still come up.

375
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:57,336
♪

376
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,392
Off the main drag... girl,
you're wearing the hat

377
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,026
and everything!

378
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,161
A backyard.

379
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,228
Thanks for coming.

380
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,796
I never had such a good time.

381
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:22,134
A well-tended home surrounded
by many neglected ones.

382
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,970
An example of Detroit-style
entrepreneurship.

383
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,339
Greedy Greg's, a do it yourself

384
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,908
barbecue joint started
by these two.

385
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,009
Rochelle and Greg.

386
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,244
I'm greedy Greg.

387
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,714
On the menu, absolutely
delicious straight from the

388
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,217
grill ribs and rib tips.

389
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:41,420
But the really good
stuff is inside.

390
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:46,258
Superb smoked pork loaded
collards, and Mac and cheese.

391
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:50,329
Thank you so much.

392
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:57,869
This is perfect.

393
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,505
That's good.

394
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:01,507
I'm going to use
this spoon here.

395
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,175
It's unbelievably good.

396
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:03,843
The Mac?

397
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:06,345
The Greens are incredible.

398
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,380
Oh, those are good.

399
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:13,452
So the greens, is that
like smoked hammock?

400
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,620
I can't tell you my secret.

401
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,689
Those are some of the best
Greens I've ever had.

402
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,924
I've been all over the south.

403
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,892
I've had a lot of Greens.

404
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,461
They're not just delicious.

405
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,196
They're luxurious.

406
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:27,466
Big hunks of you won't
tell me what in there.

407
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,535
I can't give away my secret.

408
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,103
Will this kind of
entrepreneurship lead Detroit

409
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,974
out of its sinkhole?

410
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:36,643
Probably not.

411
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:37,377
I can't believe there's not a

412
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:39,378
line of cars around the corner.

413
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,213
That was good.

414
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:42,714
But it's no longer
about winning, is it?

415
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:48,421
It's about surviving.

416
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:06,972
There are approximately
80,000 abandoned buildings

417
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:10,609
within Detroit's 140
square miles city limits.

418
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,478
What that translates to,

419
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:16,515
unfortunately, is about
14 acts of arson a day.

420
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,749
Nearly 5,000 a year.

421
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,950
That's just arson.

422
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,753
That doesn't include the
thousands of other types of

423
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,122
fires and medical emergencies

424
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:28,093
the Detroit fire department
responds to every day.

425
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:31,297
With an ever-lower valued

426
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:32,598
housing market where you can buy

427
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,600
a home for as little as $500,

428
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,168
many houses are burned
down for the insurance.

429
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,872
Many because angry neighbors
desperate to hang on see

430
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,674
abandoned structures taken over

431
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,143
by crack heads or drug gangs.

432
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,545
With law enforcement stretched

433
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:50,516
ridiculously thin, they
resort to burning them out.

434
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:51,983
They won't say it.

435
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,385
I will.

436
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,053
The Detroit fire department is

437
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,622
underfunded, underequipped,

438
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,890
often badly and incompetently

439
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:03,529
led, and up against what seems
like a neverending war.

440
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,197
A city on fire.

441
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,666
Their safety equipment, their

442
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:13,405
boots, their clothes are often
moldering and shambolic.

443
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,374
But they fight on.

444
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:18,243
This is the second time
they've been to this house.

445
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:22,681
If it happens to be arson,
chances are no one will ever

446
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:23,149
know for sure.

447
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,684
Given the ever-shrinking
resources available to the

448
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:30,889
department, most fires can't
even be investigated.

449
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,526
This fire is out within an hour.

450
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:39,398
And after the fire, dinner.

451
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,700
The cliche is that
firemen are great cooks.

452
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:45,704
In this case, the
cliche is true.

453
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,205
Lieutenant Mike Devons and the

454
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:50,909
boys of squad three are
cooking up a family meal.

455
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,944
Is ever firefighter expected
to cook reasonably well?

456
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,347
If they don't, they catch hell.

457
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,248
Really?

458
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,183
It's almost a perfect
society in that sense.

459
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:59,618
Because in a perfect society, I

460
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:00,952
believe everybody should be able

461
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,388
to feed themselves and their

462
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:06,358
friends or their family,
at least reasonably well.

463
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,526
If they're not able to do that,

464
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:10,762
they should be shunned and
demonized and marginalized.

465
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,365
Most of the firemen are
known for their cooking.

466
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,767
We cook some outstanding meals.

467
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:16,569
We learn to shop.

468
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,770
We learn to shop with
less to feed more.

469
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,606
You don't want to
be a belly robber.

470
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,474
You better bring some
food back for the boys.

471
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,644
Firefighters, in my experience,
are a lot like the

472
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,045
marines I've met over the years.

473
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:32,551
No matter how badly led,
ridiculously underequipped,

474
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:33,386
underappreciated, no matter how

475
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:34,820
doomed their mission, they take

476
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:39,725
a bizarre and quite beautiful

477
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:40,393
pride in at least being screwed

478
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:42,394
more than anybody else
and doing it with style.

479
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:45,431
They seem to do what
they do for themselves.

480
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:46,265
It's not a job.

481
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:49,334
It's a calling.

482
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:51,437
This is where the guys
store their gear.

483
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:53,605
As you can see, the
gear is very weathered.

484
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:54,407
How old?

485
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:56,307
This gear is only a
couple years old.

486
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,844
But it gets beat up quick.

487
00:22:58,845 --> 00:22:59,746
Yeah.

488
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:01,279
One new coat hanging in there,

489
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,782
so there's a lucky guy
that's got a new coat.

490
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,283
But that gear's
seen a new action.

491
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,818
Where's the fire pole, dude?

492
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,287
They took them.

493
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:10,122
Aw, man.

494
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:14,192
Late '90s, management
took the poles out.

495
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,795
Every boy my age, it was about
sparky the fire sliding

496
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:17,464
the poles.

497
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:19,330
I used to slide the pole.

498
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,499
Headquarters was three stories.

499
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,505
You had to really hold on
because you were going for a

500
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:27,139
ride.

501
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,107
The old running board,
we put up here.

502
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:30,642
We don't use the running board,

503
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,811
but this is how many
companies we used to have.

504
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:35,514
What percentage of
that number now?

505
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,816
Less than half.

506
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:45,817
And we're fighting
a lot more fires.

507
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,498
You know, I've got to say,

508
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,032
the kitchen is
looking pretty good.

509
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,334
It's one of the best
kitchens in the city.

510
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:59,004
Tonight's meal is
being cooked by Paul.

511
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:03,241
He's squad three's
best, they say.

512
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,543
He's reading the can.

513
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:07,012
That's a good start.

514
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,347
Tonight's menu, crabcakes

515
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,217
with a mix of actual
crab, and this stuff.

516
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:12,985
Sea leg.

517
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:14,352
Maybe you know it from such

518
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,988
beloved menu items
as California roll.

519
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,190
Hey, firefighters can't afford

520
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,060
100% jumbo lump crab meat, okay?

521
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,930
Do you know what this
stuff is, by the way?

522
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,197
It's fish, isn't it?

523
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:26,866
Pollack.

524
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,700
It's a miracle fish.

525
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,368
You can actually make
beef out of this.

526
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,071
Or beef-like substance.

527
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,339
It should be pointed out that

528
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,175
every meal is paid for
by the crew on duty.

529
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:41,046
They pool their money
and shop as a unit.

530
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,948
What's the fire house
favorite by consensus?

531
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:43,949
Steaks, man.

532
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,084
If I were the regular cook

533
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,252
here, the whole fire house would

534
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,054
be in totally open rebellion?

535
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:49,556
Why?

536
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:52,724
I'd be making stews because
they're cheap and I think

537
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:53,225
they're delicious.

538
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:57,563
I'd be trying it out with
tripe and guts on you guys.

539
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:58,630
That would not go.

540
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:00,732
You'd be eating like Italian

541
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,901
peasants every day if
I was to cook here.

542
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:06,738
You'd have a big bowl of stew
with a big hunk of bread.

543
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:11,577
And I would be pocketing
the difference.

544
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:12,311
Yeah.

545
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:14,045
Lamb chops seared in the pan and

546
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,080
finished over the grill.

547
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:18,950
Then Caesar's salad
with chicken.

548
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,486
How are the other firefighters
eating around the city?

549
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,421
What are you guys
having for chow?

550
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:28,259
You ever tempted to say
oh yeah, we had truffles.

551
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,563
All the time.

552
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,265
I'm going to be cooking
lobster in a minute.

553
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,101
Lobster again.

554
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:37,603
I keep telling the guys no more

555
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:40,438
lobster, I just can't take it.

556
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:44,743
We're free to eat?

557
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:49,347
Yes.

558
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,782
Nice job on the crabcakes.

559
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:51,684
Yeah.

560
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:52,652
Full of meat.

561
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:54,119
Very tasty.

562
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,624
So if it's not good, you're
not diplomatic about it.

563
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,125
No, not at all.

564
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,426
We tell them nice try.

565
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,361
A lot of cooks, they look at

566
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:06,832
that kitchen, there's a lot
of room, a lot of spices.

567
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,499
You can pretty much
make anything in there.

568
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,270
It's a good place to be a cook.

569
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,939
Nice job there, Paulie.

570
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,807
Yes, well-done, sir.

571
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,976
Generally speaking,
you eat fast.

572
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,044
Because you never know.

573
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,779
In all likelihood, you are not

574
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,348
going to get to
finish that meal.

575
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,951
Well, obviously Tony is
not doing any dishes.

576
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,719
I'll do all the dishes.

577
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,621
No.

578
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:28,988
Hell, no.

579
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:31,022
Wouldn't be the first
time, won't be the last.

580
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,992
No way.

581
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,835
At this point, you may be

582
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,336
asking, what about all the cool

583
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:50,408
stuff I hear about Detroit?

584
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,010
That's what you're thinking.

585
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,744
The vibrant new do it yourself

586
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:54,412
culture of urban renaissance,

587
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,714
young entrepreneurs transforming

588
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:57,048
the city one block at a time.

589
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,049
Where's that?

590
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,751
Well, that is happening.

591
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:01,820
Young, idealistic hard-working

592
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,222
people are indeed doing their

593
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,257
best to bring light and hope and

594
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,893
beauty to this
greatest of cities.

595
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:10,061
You've got to start with the

596
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,596
deeply felt and absolute belief

597
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:14,332
that Detroit is indeed a great

598
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,402
city and that it
is worth saving.

599
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:21,439
As utterly screwed as Detroit
may be, you have to be a

600
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,378
twisted, unpatriotic freak
to not believe that.

601
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,514
Behold the future.

602
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:35,620
What, like cooking
in a back alley?

603
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:36,455
Yes.

604
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:38,289
This chef has done what many

605
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,058
would call a very unwise thing.

606
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,928
After working at Gotham grill in

607
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:45,196
Manhattan, instead of staying

608
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:48,734
where the money inarguably
was, he returned to Detroit.

609
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:51,737
He's been working to get a

610
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:52,438
brick-and-mortar establishment

611
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,740
going by first doing regular

612
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:57,776
pop-ups here at guns and butter,

613
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,444
tucked into the back room of an

614
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:02,113
art gallery under an overpass
in downtown Detroit.

615
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:03,381
You have a really weird attitude

616
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,083
towards food in general.

617
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:05,617
Yeah.

618
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,485
What's that?

619
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:10,621
You've got liquor, cigarettes,
you've got coffee.

620
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,057
Or all of those things.

621
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,792
We're going to eat well.

622
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,994
Charlie may have a Pulitzer

623
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,162
prize, but his appreciation of

624
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:25,163
fine food and dining is, shall
we say... is that truth?

625
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,105
Lacking.

626
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:29,741
Worn egg yolk with a
generous helping on top.

627
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:33,011
Egg with eggs?

628
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:33,579
Yes, please.

629
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:39,450
He scarves his like
he's at Ruby Tuesday's.

630
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,452
How is that going to play out?

631
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,923
Will there be
political leadership?

632
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,959
A place to manage that fairly?

633
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,194
It will be fine.

634
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:52,831
Everybody likes a nice thing in

635
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,699
an egg shell with caviar.

636
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,101
Everybody.

637
00:28:55,102 --> 00:28:58,003
It's just all about
keeping cool.

638
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,971
No, it won't be fine, David.

639
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,307
It will not be fine if there's
not political leadership.

640
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,042
It will not.

641
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:06,177
Well, sometimes political
leadership grows up out of

642
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:06,779
what's happening.

643
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,880
And we don't have any political
leadership and this is

644
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:09,215
happening.

645
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:10,615
Are you an optimist?

646
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,683
I'm an optimist.

647
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,853
I'm here in this
garage with you.

648
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:20,691
Chilled summer soup with
melon, tomato, lemon broth.

649
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:21,893
Summer soup.

650
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,494
All the melons from the market.

651
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,030
The coriander blossoms were

652
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:27,465
picked from a farm
right here in Detroit.

653
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:28,000
Thank you.

654
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,734
Thank you.

655
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:31,302
It's good, isn't it?

656
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:36,207
I would describe
that... may I, chef?

657
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:41,346
As a light, airy gaspacho.

658
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:45,416
I wouldn't even go that far.

659
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:50,721
He sees an opportunity to make a

660
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,891
melon... you put
gin in your soup?

661
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,059
The soup is delicious.

662
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,194
You're on your own, dude.

663
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,863
You know, when I was chef and

664
00:29:57,864 --> 00:29:59,865
you poured gin in my soup, I

665
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:02,367
would have stabbed you in
the neck with my fork.

666
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:03,434
I'm dying somewhere inside.

667
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:06,171
Your like the worst-case
scenario customer.

668
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:11,076
Next up, smoked mussels, lightly

669
00:30:11,077 --> 00:30:14,279
steamed in white wine and
butter, served in a lobster

670
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,515
broth with fried
onions and honey.

671
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:18,516
Quite delicious.

672
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:23,054
Baby Greek salad with
beets, tomato and fennel.

673
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,389
All sourced locally.

674
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,757
A tribute to the Greek diners

675
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:32,597
where Craig grew up
dining with his family.

676
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:35,600
A restaurant in Vegas, and
here he is in Detroit.

677
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:36,402
Guess what?

678
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:44,209
The head aches are less.

679
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,111
You're appreciated here.

680
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:49,214
This would be considered a

681
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,916
foolhardy venture
in the chef world.

682
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:52,383
We like food, too.

683
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:53,618
We're not space aliens.

684
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,986
People often say thank you.

685
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,721
We lived in Chicago
the last six years.

686
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,990
We lived in L.A. the
last six years.

687
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,493
Thank you, this is
exactly what we wanted.

688
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,996
What you've done is
counter intuitive.

689
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:09,134
There is a conventional
cheer path for chefs.

690
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:11,136
Instead, you decide
to go to Detroit.

691
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:12,004
Hell yeah.

692
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:12,972
Come back home.

693
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:20,973
People think I'm crazy for
going back to Detroit.

694
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:28,086
Potato simmered this white
wine, thyme and fennel seeds.

695
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:29,620
Finished with butter pine nuts.

696
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:33,824
Followed by locally sourced
lamb cooked perfectly.

697
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,626
Topped with sour cherries,

698
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:39,464
toasted pistachios,
coriander, and yogurt sauce.

699
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,799
In what way does opening a fine

700
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,003
dining restaurant in Detroit
benefit the majority of

701
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:45,304
detroiters?

702
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:47,205
How is it not making it better?

703
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,941
How is sitting back not doing
anything making it better?

704
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,676
How is it only buying my

705
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:53,945
products from farmers in
Detroit not helping Detroit?

706
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:54,980
I'm supplying from Detroit.

707
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:57,515
I'm hiring people from Detroit.

708
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,850
Everybody here lives in Detroit.

709
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,521
If I were asked the same
question, I would say I don't

710
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:03,722
know.

711
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:05,856
I'm doing what I do well.

712
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,358
I'm doing it in a place that I

713
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,061
love and I'm demonstrating that

714
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,663
yet another person gives a...

715
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,665
About Detroit and believes
in it enough to be here.

716
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,067
You're 100% right.

717
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,368
I never really thought about it.

718
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,636
Until you asked that question.

719
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,538
To me, it's just obvious.

720
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,708
What will the Detroit of
the future look like?

721
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,143
Whatever you may think it should

722
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:29,548
look like, it will
probably taste like this.

723
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,559
Somewhere in this unassuming

724
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,728
neighborhood, one can sit
down for an excellent meal.

725
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:46,064
But you won't find this place on

726
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:49,267
yelp, and unfortunately, I
cannot tell you where it is

727
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:49,535
exactly.

728
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:51,936
Why not, you ask?

729
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,171
It's not exactly a restaurant,

730
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:57,542
you see, which means it's not,
strictly speaking, legal.

731
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,277
What is this place?

732
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:00,079
Pupusa house.

733
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,747
I call it pupusa house.

734
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:07,052
It's a cultural thing.

735
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:08,453
Traditionally they're
out of houses.

736
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,520
It's just something that people

737
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,855
bring over and they come.

738
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:14,025
So this is about as traditional
as it gets right here.

739
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,426
It's just like home.

740
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:16,028
Yep.

741
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:18,263
This is what's called
a pupusa house.

742
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:20,031
Literally, a house.

743
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:24,102
This one serving home-cooked
Salvadorian meals.

744
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:26,437
Once a living room, now
the main dining area.

745
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:27,805
The woman running it, we can't

746
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,274
show her face, but she's been

747
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:32,210
here for ten years serving a

748
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:34,445
mostly Salvadoran clientele,

749
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,214
looking for a taste of home.

750
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,949
First up a staple done a little

751
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,987
differently than the norm.

752
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:46,624
Tamales wrapped in banana
leafs and steamed.

753
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:46,925
Delicious.

754
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:48,726
Next the dish of the house,

755
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:52,763
tortillas stuffed
with ground pork.

756
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,734
You have pupusas in
Nicaragua, in Guatemala.

757
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,404
But for some reason, Salvadorian

758
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:00,738
pupusas get the most respect.

759
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,840
General consensus seems
to be they're the best.

760
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:03,342
How come?

761
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:04,343
I would agree.

762
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:06,677
George Azar is our
Detroit fixer.

763
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:10,081
He's been coming here with
his friend Joe for years.

764
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:16,121
This is what makes
it right here, this.

765
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:16,422
Cortido.

766
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:22,360
It's pickled.

767
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:26,464
I don't know if you
can hang, man.

768
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:29,267
It's turning into it.

769
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:32,036
Mexican spice.

770
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,304
Salvadorian, not spicy.

771
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:35,540
They don't do it that spicy.

772
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,276
This is porky goodness,
that's for sure.

773
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:43,181
It's fried pork, ground
with pepper and tomato.

774
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:43,449
Simple.

775
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:48,353
Taking the Liberty of ordering
some Detroit beverages

776
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:50,388
that we've overlooked so far.

777
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:57,061
It's like a cross between
ginger beer and ginger ale.

778
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,529
It's in the middle.

779
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,997
It's my favorite
beverage in the city.

780
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:06,871
I needed this to enhance
my street cred in Detroit.

781
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:11,242
Then pollo asado.

782
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,211
This is where it's at.

783
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:13,678
Got lives in there.

784
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,045
Butter, garlic.

785
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:15,514
Simple, delicious.

786
00:35:15,515 --> 00:35:19,550
It's the low-fat butter.

787
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,419
That's good.

788
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,220
It's like a big hug.

789
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,355
How did you find your way here?

790
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,824
Honestly, it's only
word of mouth.

791
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:29,059
But you have annoying
foodie websites, right?

792
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,428
But they're not coming here.

793
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:31,729
They're not coming here?

794
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,898
Oh, no.

795
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:39,170
There are thousands of foodies
with ironic sunglasses

796
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:44,875
and fedoras and they're just
waiting to get in here.

797
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,412
I get mad at him when he
starts bringing different

798
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:47,679
people.

799
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,915
You hate a line of people?

800
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,083
I don't want to
wait for my plate.

801
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,519
Who hates money?

802
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,187
With her, it's not
about the money.

803
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,290
It's about keeping
the tradition alive.

804
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,459
What happens when a
city goes bankrupt?

805
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,693
When it's at the point that it's

806
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,429
actually considering selling

807
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,398
what's left of itself in chunks.

808
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,099
In Detroit, city services are

809
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,135
reduced or cut out come plately.

810
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:15,440
Fewer buses, fewer cops,
fewer firefighters.

811
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:17,775
Answer, they turn to
each other for help.

812
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:21,412
Or figure out how to
do it for themselves.

813
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:22,947
Detroit has a reputation as a

814
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:26,884
tough town, but that toughness
is about resilience, too.

815
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,787
The insistence on sticking
with it, no matter what.

816
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,489
On not giving up in the face of

817
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:37,662
the utter failure of
leadership year after year.

818
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:41,932
If the city abandons its parks
and leaves them to become

819
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,134
overgrown and eaten like much of

820
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,404
the city by tall grass and

821
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:48,506
weeds, then somebody has got
to do something, right?

822
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:49,907
Meet the mower gang.

823
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,242
Started by this guy.

824
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:58,849
Tom Nardone with a simple
mission of doing what they can

825
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,585
to keep the parks maintained.

826
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,687
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

827
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,689
We're the Detroit mower gang.

828
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,992
We clean up the abandoned
parks and playgrounds.

829
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:08,993
Why would you do that?

830
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:11,161
Kids need a place to play.

831
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,830
If you're under ten years old,

832
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,165
you deserve some justice in
this world, don't you think?

833
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:15,667
Yeah.

834
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,335
Yeah.

835
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:18,135
How did this thing start?

836
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:19,670
I guess I started it.

837
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,506
I bought a lawn tractor when the

838
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:24,041
city announced closing 72 parks.

839
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,311
They're going to stop
maintaining it or physically

840
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:27,178
shut it up?

841
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:29,647
They don't physically
shut it up.

842
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,716
Because there's no money here.

843
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:34,084
They just take the trash
barrels away and stop mowing.

844
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,787
Crazy.

845
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:40,991
It's a strange place, Detroit.

846
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,128
When we're done here, it will
not look like a nice park.

847
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,963
But still a playable park.

848
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:46,997
And a visible park.

849
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,533
So if you had kids, you could

850
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:49,468
see what they're
doing in this park.

851
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,135
It's safer.

852
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:51,870
All right.

853
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:53,170
Well, let's cut some grass.

854
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:53,739
Come on, you'll like it.

855
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,374
It's fun.

856
00:37:56,375 --> 00:38:04,375
♪

857
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,488
There's grass in my beer.

858
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:53,564
In Detroit approximately 40

859
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:54,932
square miles have been reverted

860
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,602
to basically unused green space.

861
00:38:57,603 --> 00:39:01,205
In many cities, so-called urban

862
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:04,575
farming may be looked upon
as cynics like my as an

863
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,310
affectation.

864
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,078
Here in Detroit, it's not.

865
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,780
With nature taking back the

866
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,281
landscape block by block, the

867
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:15,453
urban farm is really the
last line of defense.

868
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:18,322
D-town sits on the western
border of Detroit.

869
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:18,890
Where are we?

870
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:20,658
We're in the largest park in

871
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,259
the city which is
called Rouge park.

872
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,062
Did you just come in and start
digging or did you have

873
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:25,964
permission to come in?

874
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:27,632
We had permission to come in.

875
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:28,933
Was that difficult?

876
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:29,635
It was very difficult.

877
00:39:29,636 --> 00:39:31,602
We negotiated with the
city for two years.

878
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,103
Part of the difficulty was they

879
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,673
didn't know what hook
to hang our request on.

880
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:38,643
They would come saying I want to

881
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,445
build a strip mall or
parking structure.

882
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:42,279
They're not used to people

883
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,517
saying I want land to build
a model organic farm.

884
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:48,753
Malik started growing the

885
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:51,622
farm for people to have greater

886
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,290
access to fresh produce in a

887
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,960
area that grocery stores
had completely abandoned.

888
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:59,664
That's basically all of
Detroit's inner city.

889
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,365
Other than whole foods that came

890
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:04,034
in, not a single
national food chain.

891
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:04,770
No.

892
00:40:04,771 --> 00:40:07,638
In 2007 farmer Jack closed
his last stores in Detroit.

893
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,107
That was kind of the end of
the big chains in Detroit.

894
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:12,877
Assistance farming,
not cash crop.

895
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:18,215
You're not going to be
anticipating selling outside of

896
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:18,484
Detroit.

897
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:22,319
There's greater demand in
Detroit than all of the local

898
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,488
farmers can supply.

899
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:26,824
First we want to supply the

900
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,358
demand in the city of Detroit.

901
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,127
To what degree do you think

902
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:33,063
this model can be replicated
in and around the city?

903
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,800
We think it has great potential.

904
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:39,637
One of the things we have in
Detroit is access to huge

905
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:40,671
amounts of land.

906
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,139
If we're able to produce even a

907
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,875
small percentage of the food

908
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,077
which is consumed in Detroit and

909
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:48,245
circulate the revenues from that

910
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,847
food within our community, then

911
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,683
we're able to create a more

912
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,685
vibrant, healthy, economically
strong community.

913
00:40:54,686 --> 00:41:02,686
So we think it has
tremendous potential.

914
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:12,837
Who will live in the
Detroit of the future?

915
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:13,838
There's no question, is there,

916
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,274
that Detroit will come back?

917
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:20,110
In one form or another, a city

918
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,379
this magnificent, this storied,

919
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,581
this American cannot, will not

920
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:27,752
ever disappear into the weeds.

921
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:29,219
There are too few places this

922
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,288
beautiful for it to be allowed

923
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:34,024
to crumble like Angkor or Rome.

924
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,960
Someone will live in a smaller,

925
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:40,297
tighter, no doubt hipper,
much contracted new Detroit.

926
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:41,732
But who will that be?

927
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:46,203
Will it be the people who
stuck it out here, who fought

928
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:46,972
block-by-block to keep their

929
00:41:46,973 --> 00:41:48,939
city from burning, who struggled

930
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,075
to defend their homes, keep up

931
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:51,877
appearances as all around them

932
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:57,915
their neighborhoods emptied.

933
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,250
What will Detroit look
like in 20 years?

934
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,220
Or 50?

935
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,155
That's not just a
Detroit question.

936
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:08,158
That's an America question.
