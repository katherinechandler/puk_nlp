To reach a place previously

49
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,542
considered a no go area, I'll

fly out of an airport in

51
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,581
Villavicencio 45 miles southeast

52
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:04,451
of the capital city of Bogota.

53
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:07,987
On first inspection, this is an

00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,055
airplane bone yard where

00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,424
unwanted props from romancing

00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:17,330
the stone corrode artfully.

57
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:20,633
But in reality, this sleepy

58
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,469
hangar is an important gateway

59
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:29,175
to the more impenetrable
parts of the country.

60
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,943
The remote settlements in the

61
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,745
Amazon basin are cut off from

62

the country with neither rail

63
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,914
nor roads connecting them.

64
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,784
There are only two ways in,

65
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,185
either boat for several days

00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,820
down river or aboard a jungle

67
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:44,324
bus which is what locals call

68
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:50,530
the world war ii era D.C. 3.

69
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,131
I've been brought here by

70
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,767
Pablo Mora a teacher at the

71
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,469
university and a particular

72
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,439
enthusiast for this classic
of golden age aviation.

73
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,673
You've taken this flight before?

74
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:01,208
Yes.

75
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:06,145
Every time I have a chance
I come here and fly one.

76
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,814
It is a romantic thing.

77
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:10,517
He sees the work these
hulking great air ships and

78
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:12,218
their pilots do as daredevil

00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,553
humanitarian missions for the

80
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:17,156
more remote Colombians.

81
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,825
An in flight movie?

82
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:19,527
No.

83
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:20,394
Nor first class either.

84
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:20,794
What?

85
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:28,795
No, no.

86
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,003
The planes travel with their

87
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,739
own mechanic to cobble together

88
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,475
anything that might go wrong
and stuff can go wrong.

89
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,076
The risk is that we'll be able

90
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,978
to land but not take off again.

91
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:46,979
So this guy is our return
ticket out of the jungle.

92
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,732
Our captain is something of a

93
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:07,733
legend in these parts and
his copilot copilot.

94
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,012
It's mystical.

95
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,714
They develop this
sensibility with the plane.

96
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,949
There is no Intel, no software.

97
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:24,190
They have GPS but
that's about it.

98
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,125
It's beautiful.

99
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:26,359
They have to sense everything.

100
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,461
They know when the sound
of the plane is not right.

101
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:36,462
It's just man and machine.

102
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:41,741
The weather is the big
unknown and it is changeable

103
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:42,710
enough to ground planes in

104
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:50,711
remote places if they
hang around for too long.

105
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,154
We have to make one stop on the

106
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,924
way to pick up more cargo.

107
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:05,925
Vital cargo, by the way.

108
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,276
While we're passing over this

109
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,745
beautiful and lush area the life

110
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,414
of those below has
been anything but.

111
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:24,784
Colombia seems to be trapped
in a vicious circle.

112
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:28,354
The territory is used as
a haven for kidnappers.

113
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,857
Until recently most of the
news out of this part of

114
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:31,692
Colombia was not good.

115
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:34,927
It was a front line in the war

116
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,596
on drugs, for lack after better

117
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:40,600
term and Colombia's long

118
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:44,704
struggle with the Marxist drug

119
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:45,972
cartel with kidnapping and

120
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:46,807
assistance from Venezuela.

121
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:48,608
50 years of very dirty war.

122
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,777
The stakes not about drugs per

123
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,613
Se but about the ability of

124
00:06:53,614 --> 00:07:01,614
ordinary Colombians
to live without fear.

125
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:07,727
We land in the Jung the out post

126
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:13,399
of Mirraflores in the
amazonian forest preserve.

127
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,902
The heavy presence of army and

128
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,504
special police is a result of

129
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,071
the strategic location and

130
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,874
recent history as a one-time

131
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,244
center of Coca production.

132
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,245
Farmers would grow the stuff and

133
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,747
make the leaves into paste.

134
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,717
Traffickers would
come and buy it.

135
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,251
The FARC had this area under its

136
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:37,256
sphere of influence for years.

137
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,357
Nine years ago the government

138
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,393
moved to expel the FARC,
traffickers, and any

139
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,530
paramilitaries with
apparently much success.

140
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:48,267
Overnight, however, its
population shrank by 85% and

141
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:56,268
what remains struggles
to survive.

142
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,955
You're telling me the
people were born here?

143
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,690
Most of the people
came from elsewhere.

144
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,725
In the beginning in the 1950s

145
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,427
and '6 Os they were escaping

146
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,063
from the violence, from the

147
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,264
political violence between the

148
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,365
two parties in Colombia.

149
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,434
So if you were having
problems in the city or in

150
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,671
wherever you were from
you came out here.

151
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:25,472
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,907
So what did you do for
a living out here?

153
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,977
Cattle and some agriculture

154
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,879
and after that the drug trade

155
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,818
began and everything with
the Coca plantation.

156
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:39,787
This climate is good for it?

157
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:40,987
Very good.

158
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:42,321
Since 1999 there was no police

159
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,056
or army force here so it was

160
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,793
just occupied by the FARC.

161
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,895
And then by the paramilitary.

162
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:49,162
Yeah.

163
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:57,163
So that is when the
real violence began.

164
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,241
So the problem preexisted
the drug trade.

165
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,343
The drug trade just
made everything more.

166
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,512
There is no judge here,
few institutions.

167
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:07,513
Basically you know the state is

168
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,949
here just because
the army is here.

169
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,322
So I think when I
met the major...

170
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,857
Anthony, this is the major.

171
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,492
Julio Cesar Gonzalez is the

172
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,962
current mayor of Miraflores

173
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,698
which has seen much better
and much worse days.

174
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,700
How many people
live in this town?

175
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:33,906
Around 1500, 2,000
in the community.

176
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,207
The FARC were here for 20 years

177
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:40,880
and they were the
central authority here.

178
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,148
Not doing particularly well,

179
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,683
not particularly happy
with the government.

180
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:44,684
Somebody comes along and offers

181
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:48,054
you a nice machine gun
and a cool scarf.

182
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:48,656
Yeah.

183
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:50,690
Especially if you're
15, 16 years old.

184
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,391
That's a pretty
attractive offer.

185
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,060
Of course it is.

186
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:55,828
Even if they say you'll
probably be dead by the time

187
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,129
you're 25.

188
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:56,664
It is.

189
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:57,964
And they offer you a salary.

190
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:05,965
So what is the
future of this town?

191
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:15,748
They're providing free

192
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,751
education but there is a little

193
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,988
potential of diversity
and Eco tourism as well.

194
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,390
Without the customer, there

195
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,593
is no cocaine trade
and no violence.

196
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:27,795
Right?

197
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:31,898
So is the United States and

198
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:32,999
Europe still buying cocaine?

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,867
I can't think about the

200
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,769
situation where the demand
is not going to be there.

201
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,338
But the demand in the
states is down 40%.

202
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,107
As long as there is a market

203
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:49,108
there will be people
ready to do it.

204
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:52,685
The United States puts how many

205
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,754
billions of dollars a year

206
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:57,256
paying for guns and uniforms
and training, etcetera.

207
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,290
Where should they
be spending it?

208
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,792
I would say health is very

209
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,027
important but more important is

210
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,428
to end the war on drugs.

211
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,930
It's just, it doesn't work.

212
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,298
Here is my problem.

213
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,134
If crack didn't exist I would

214
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:11,570
have no... I have
absolutely agree with you.

215
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,473
But as a former coke addict and

216
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,975
crack head, that is a problem.

217
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:16,476
Yeah.

218
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:17,609
The thing is that people think

219
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,645
that if you think that drugs

220
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,748
should be legalized you're
saying they're good.

221
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:22,149
No.

222
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,050
We're not saying that.

223
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:26,085
But just we're just getting
rid of one problem.

224
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,154
The problem the major has here.

225
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,656
A lot of money you could divert.

226
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:31,558
We have two problems.

227
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,459
I agree.

228
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,993
One is drug addiction and the

229
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,161
other is drug trafficking.

230
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,328
We'll get rid of one.

231
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,629
We won't get rid of the other.

232
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,098
We have to deal with it forever.

233
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,833
It is a beautiful country.

234
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:45,404
The people here are, from
I've seen are really nice.

235
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,672
Even the bad guys are charming.

236
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,007
Yeah.

237
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:47,607
That is true.

238
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:48,608
The food is delicious.

239
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:55,748
The problem is the United
States will never leave.

240
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:56,249
Complicated issues.

241
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:56,583
Yeah.

242
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:57,917
So the good people of this

243
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,251
town can thank us for bringing

244
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:03,622
in their fresh
supply of... yeah.

245
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,191
Coca.

246
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,026
Nothing of it, gentlemen.

247
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:07,327
It was really our pleasure.

248
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,278
> Bogota the country's capital

249
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,115
and a city with new
lofty food ambitions.

250
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,449
Where previously a restaurant

251
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,552
scene didn't really exist.

252
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,822
Now young restaurant owners such

253
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:37,990
as this musician turned chef are

254
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:45,991
beginning to make a name for
themselves in Colombia.

255
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,539
One of the biggest
markets in Bogota.

256
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,474
I love this place.

257
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,475
It is very beautiful.

258
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,343
The colors.

259
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:58,377
My mom comes here
to buy flowers.

260
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,380
My grandma also.

261
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,984
Did I mention this city
is over 8,000 feet up?

262
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,988
Hence the altitude
sickness I'm feeling.

263
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:09,756
Not good.

264
00:13:09,757 --> 00:13:11,223
Tomas comes here a few times a

265
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,491
week for an early breakfast

266
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:20,492
which I'm hoping will
make me feel better.

267
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,102
This market has been running in

268
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,037
one form or another
since the 1940s.

269
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:30,209
This place is huge.

270
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,011
Want some juice?

271
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:31,444
Yeah.

272
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:32,678
What do you have?

273
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,013
I love it.

274
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:41,187
Orange juice with carrots.

275
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:44,190
Probably the healthiest
thing I've had in a while.

276
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,092
Good for the high altitude.

277
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:46,693
Yeah.

278
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:47,759
This is better.

279
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,528
I'm feeling better every hour.

280
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:49,930
Yeah.

281
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:51,463
The first hour is killing me.

282
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,032
But you have a better face.

283
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,033
I didn't think I was going to

284
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,734
make it out of the airport.

285
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,204
Most of the mornings, early

286
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,371
in the morning 5:00 to 6:00 in

287
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,541
the morning I climb
the mountain.

288
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,542
Why?

289
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,543
Fresh air.

290
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:04,878
Okay.

291
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,712
You have to come with me.

292
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:11,783
Hell no.

293
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,220
Ain't happening.

294
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,423
You want to taste this?

295
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:21,727
This is made with corn.

296
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:22,794
It is fantastic.

297
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:30,795
I love it.

298
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,575
Tucked in the back corner of the

299
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,843
fish market is a place that

300
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,845
serves breakfast to the market's

301
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,114
workers and shoppers.

302
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,916
We're talking beef short ribs

303
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,085
simmered in an oily broth with

304
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,188
potatoes, salt, and scallions.

305
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,457
Tomas swears by this stuff, the

306
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:58,264
traditional breakfast
soup from the region.

307
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,365
There we go.

308
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,799
Okay.

309
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,034
Gracias.

310
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:04,536
Would you like chili?

311
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,537
I do.

312
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:12,378
Gracias.

313
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:12,612
Yeah.

314
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,013
Now we're talking.

315
00:15:13,014 --> 00:15:15,114
This is perfect when you have

316
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,515
a good party last night.

317
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,818
I was just going to say,
this is hangover food.

318
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,787
I know hangover food
well and this is good.

319
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,956
Perfect.

320
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,524
Some meat in there.

321
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,026
Yeah.

322
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:27,693
Good broth.

323
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:28,561
Yes.

324
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:28,795
Good.

325
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:32,131
So what is this dish called?

326
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:37,903
Beef stock... broth over rib.

327
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:38,405
Yes.

328
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:40,472
With potatoes of course.

329
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:47,747
Even with potato.

330
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,849
Very good Spanish.

331
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,051
I don't speak Spanish.

332
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,154
I speak a little Mexican.

333
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,244
Bogota, back in the '90s a very

334
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,846
dangerous and violent
place to be.

335
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,182
Today, not so much.

336
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,783
Today in my repeated experiences

337
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:29,888
here kind of awesome.

338
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,690
This is the recently renovated

339
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,625
old city where I meet up with

340
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,294
Hector, distinguished author and

341
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,363
one of the most important and

342
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:40,366
supremely talented writers
in Latin America.

343
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,268
Hector's recent work, a memoir

344
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,203
called "oblivion" is about his

345
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,604
father who was killed for his

346
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:53,605
outspoken attempts to change
things for the better.

347
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,316
First of all, where are we?

348
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,919
This is a place where many

349
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,888
Bogotans come to eat something

350
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,122
in the middle of the morning or

351
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,756
the middle of the afternoon.

352
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,825
The tomales here are made

353
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,394
with chicken and pork belly

354
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,561
combined with vegetables, rice,

355
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,463
and massa wrapped in a banana

356
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,300
leaf and slow cooked for hours.

357
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,168
This place has been serving

358
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,571
chocolate to the politicians of

359
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:23,509
nearby Plaza for a
couple hundred years.

360
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,944
Here are the tomales.

361
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:26,313
Beautiful.

362
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:28,347
It is a thing of
beauty isn't it?

363
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,516
Let's see if it is
like my mother's.

364
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,118
Oh, that's a high standard.

365
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:36,855
I suppose it is not.

366
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:41,927
I was just to the
market yesterday.

367
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,996
What economy there was at

368
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,265
Miraflores was a drug economy.

369
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,434
Now the drugs are gone
and there is no economy.

370
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,936
It is a ghost town with the

371
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,204
military and people sitting

372
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,272
there staring at space waiting

373
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,174
for beer to arrive
best I can understand.

374
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,109
Tell me something hopeful.

375
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,476
I think we are becoming more

376
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:01,046
and more conscious that this

377
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,650
past decades of violence have

378
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:12,651
been absolutely useless.

379
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:17,296
And that we have to change
many, many, many things.

380
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:20,132
So I think it is not as
good as my mother's.

381
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:24,336
Well, it never is.

383
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,737
If you remove cocaine from

384
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,139
the equation, remove the drug

385
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,740
trade as a financial engine, you

386
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,310
would still have serious

387
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:34,980
divisions over ideology here.

388
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,415
Is that improving?

389
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,850
Things are changing in a good

390
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,888
direction, but very slowly.

391
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:46,258
I think.

392
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,160
You know, ten years ago they

393
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:51,330
killed 7,500 people every year.

394
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:55,667
And three years ago this number

395
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:59,538
came to 700 people killed.

396
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,573
So the situation changed.

397
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,175
Right.

398
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,442
I have only questions.

399
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,743
I have no answers.

400
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:05,412
I'm so sorry.

401
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:09,915
If I were the president, I
really... I don't know.

402
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,350
You wouldn't know what to do.

403
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:11,618
No.

404
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,352
I wouldn't.

405
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:12,919
I wouldn't.

406
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,422
To suggest that a nation
should expand its social

407
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:17,756
services, do its best to lift

408
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:22,861
people out of poverty, to
provide medical care for

409
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,530
everyone, as you well know, that

410
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:29,235
may be in the minds of many.

411
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:32,571
Are those as dangerous and

412
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:36,542
potentially ideas
as they used to be?

413
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,710
Well, 25 years ago my father

414
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:42,047
was killed just because he was

415
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,715
asking for these basic things

416
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:49,221
like clean water, a glass of

417
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:52,123
milk, and a bath
for every child.

418
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,625
That was... we still don't have

419
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,127
that and we need that.

420
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,497
Now we in Colombia,
maybe we are trying.

421
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,232
I think there are some people

422
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,567
here even in the government who

423
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:09,568
are working for that.

424
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,593
> Bogota is the largest city

425
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,628
in Colombia and the economic
heart of the country.

426
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,197
About a fifth of the
population lives here

427
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:33,599
many of them very well.

428
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,868
But some not so well.

429
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:43,309
It's a city with a marked
north/south divide.

430
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,043
Chef Tomas and his restaurant

431
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,679
sit side by side in the macarena

432
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:55,287
neighborhood where the city
center meets the north.

433
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,489
The lunch Tomas is serving us

434
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,525
here is defined more by high

435
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,528
quality fundamentals than
by high concept theories.

436
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,963
If there is a theme here, it's

437
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,165
that ingredients this good,

438
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,800
meticulously prepared, are the

439
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:15,206
essence of great eating.

440
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,208
It's a beautiful space.

441
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,479
So how is the restaurant
business in Bogota?

442
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,847
It's a big business.

443
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:25,651
A lot of people don't
know how to cook.

444
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:26,752
Nobody cooks at home.

445
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:27,720
Maybe their cook does.

446
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:28,721
They eat out a lot?

447
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:32,391
Yeah.

448
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,559
It's a new culture.

449
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,394
Everybody wants to go
to the restaurant.

450
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,096
Ten, 15 years ago what,
traditional, casual food?

451
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,331
Yeah.

452
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:42,033
A few fine dining, white

453
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,235
table cloths, continental or

454
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,504
Italian, but this is new?

455
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,238
This is a new business.

456
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:54,946
A new world.

457
00:21:54,947 --> 00:22:00,519
It is the mixture
of the cultures.

458
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,253
It's beautiful.

459
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:06,057
The other thing is all of the

460
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,626
region with the rivers and the

461
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:11,029
sea we are like a big farm, a

462
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,931
beautiful farm to send all this

463
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:16,468
produce to the world.

464
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,137
I believe more in a beautiful

465
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:23,775
carrot than a great recipe.

466
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:29,080
Yeah.

467
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:29,816
Right.

468
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:32,083
This is pasta.

469
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,385
Thin sheets of hand made

470
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,454
pasta are filled with cheese and

471
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:42,160
finished with a cherizo sauce.

472
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:42,328
Yum.

473
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:44,129
So you used to be a musician.

474
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:44,431
Yeah.

475
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:45,164
I am still.

476
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:45,565
Still.

477
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:46,598
So what happened, man?

478
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:52,804
How did you go from
music to restaurants?

479
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:53,473
Money.

480
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:53,806
Good.

481
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:54,807
Good, yeah.

482
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:55,141
Really good.

483
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:56,475
It's great business is good

484
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,976
because generally speaking the

485
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,511
only worse idea I think I'll try

486
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:01,279
to make a living making music is

487
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,685
I think I'll make a living
opening a restaurant.

488
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,687
I see why that's so popular.

489
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,022
Good stuff.

490
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,491
Thank you, Tony.

491
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:18,464
Tomas's take uses beef shank

492
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:21,500
instead of veal which is braised

493
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:24,102
overnight with wine and
broth in a wood fired oven.

494
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:24,837
Oh, wow.

495
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:27,873
It's huge.

496
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:28,040
Yes.

497
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,675
You don't need the knife.

498
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:33,378
Only the spoon.

499
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:41,379
Right.

500
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:49,295
Hum.

501
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:51,196
Do you cure this first in salt?

502
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:51,698
No.

503
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:52,831
Dry it, salt it?

504
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,899
No.

505
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,003
Just fresh?

506
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:58,370
Yes.

507
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:59,905
Delicious.

508
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,473
You'll have to keep this on your

509
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:02,208
menu forever, right?

510
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:04,643
Forever.

511
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:04,977
Yeah.

512
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:08,514
The best part.

513
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:16,515
Mama didn't raise no fool.

514
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:29,367
Santiago Decali is a city of

515
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:31,336
southwest Colombia known for its

516
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,372
proximity to the pacific
coast and its semitropical

517
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:34,707
temperatures.

518
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:39,210
But I'm not really
here for the climate.

519
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:45,016
I'm here for taiho.

520
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:53,017
It involves alcohol
and explosives.

521
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,061
Colombian will and their

522
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,763
bandmates are to be my guide to

523
00:24:57,764 --> 00:25:02,868
this ancient and traditional
Colombian sport.

524
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:03,435
Ah!

525
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:05,436
Thank you.

526
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:10,241
How do you play this game?

527
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:15,213
I guess that's how it's done.

528
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:21,319
What do you call this object?

529
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,588
Taiho.

530
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:29,060
Hence the name... taiho.

531
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,396
I should be good at this.

532
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:32,397
I've been throwing pots into the

533
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:35,100
dish sink from across
the room for years.

534
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,635
You win more points if you

535
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,804
get it in the middle
without hitting it.

536
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:39,138
Oh.

537
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:44,910
That doesn't sound like any fun.

538
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,912
Everyone has a different
style it seems.

539
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,647
You've got to do like one step

540
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:56,454
and then another and swing.

541
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,957
I don't believe that style
is going to work for me.

542
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,525
After early success it turns out

543
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:08,499
we all pretty much suck at this.

544
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Time to bring in
some outside muscle.

545
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:26,477
These guys.

546
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,691
Holy crap.

547
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:34,660
Two in a row?

548
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:35,694
This is dismaying.

549
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:43,695
One of those guys had to
be on my team, right?

550
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:48,339
The guy in the white.

551
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:56,340
His name is "the old chicken."

552
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:07,558
He's calling himself
the old chicken.

553
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,696
I should be the enormous one.

554
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:14,232
He's killing it.

555
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:20,571
Every time.

556
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:20,740
♪

557
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:28,741
Must beat the chicken.

558
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:34,686

is up to the challenge
making the Colombian food.

561
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,626
This is a huge selection of

fried pork, pork rib, steak,

563
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:51,402
potatoes, and deep
fried plantain.

564
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,271
I smell food.

565
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:55,807
Oh, ho.

566
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:59,978
Thank you.

567
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,047
A beer, explosives, and food?

607
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,684
was made, how music
was recorded.

608
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:19,952
Right.

609
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:21,586

of the music.

That's the idea is to
get back to the roots.

611
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:31,897
First up the Cali version of

612
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:38,904
cooked shrimp slathered in
mayonnaise, ketchup, and

613
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:39,771
Worcester sauce.

614
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:45,210
A '70s shrimp cocktail,
essentially.

615
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:48,914
Leave it to the mangroves of the

616
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:50,548
pacific coast, a stable used in

617
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:58,549
everything from tomal
eces to stews.

618
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:01,559

Ah.

620
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,965
Like a rock mollusk pretty much.

621
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:10,335
Hum.

Wow.

624
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,276
So this is from the pacific.

625
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,979
This is red snapper.

626
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,647
Steamed shrimp.

627
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:22,780
Oh, very cool.

628
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,483

You always find it everywhere.

630
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,457
With all of this food you have

631
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,994
to accompany it with this.

632
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,128
I'm learning that.

633
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,997
It is the best way
to handle this.

634
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,632
From cane sugar like home made.

635
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:46,104
So I'm just going to take mine.

636
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,673
So what are your favorite
places in Colombia?

637
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,976
Colombia is like five
countries in one.

638
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,810
When you come to Colombia you

639
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,880
definitely have to go to some

640
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,648
pacific experience either in

641
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,351
Cali or go straight to the coast

642
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:03,321
to have a Caribbean experience.

643
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:06,992
You definitely have to have a

644
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:09,327
mountain experience like Bogota.

645
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:09,628
Right.

646
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:11,629
Another would be like
go to the Amazon.

647
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,232
Go to the jungle.

648
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,967
So I'm planning a vacation.

649
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:16,235
Yeah.

650
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:17,835
Should I come to Colombia?

651
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,504
Should I come to Cali?

652
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,406
Most definitely, man.

653
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:24,075
You will find great music, great

654
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:25,910
party, great food, beautiful

655
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,478
views, beautiful nature around.

656
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,679
Yeah, yeah.

657
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,015
Look.

658
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,348
The country is beautiful.

659
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:31,183
We know this.

660
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:34,052
But most Americans
are afraid to come.

661
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,186
Is Colombia any more dangerous

662
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:41,692
for a tourist than Rio
or Puerto Rico or...

663
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:42,594
South central?

664
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:43,828
My impression is no.

665
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,364
When you go to Rio you
don't wear a big watch.

666
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,933
You don't wear an
expensive suit.

667
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,601
You don't behave like an idiot

668
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:53,504
and life is going to be good.

669
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:56,441
Like maybe I've been lucky

670
00:32:56,442 --> 00:33:00,245
but I've never been
mugged or robbed.

671
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:03,881
Most people tell you we
had an amazing time.

672
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:04,949
We heard great music.

673
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,717
We met beautiful girls or guys.

674
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,219
We drank some great drinks and

675
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,021
we just hung out and we went to

676
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,456
the beach and we, it was great,

677
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:12,557
and we want to come back.

678
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:13,092
You know?

679
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:15,260
I mean, there's a
lot of heart here.

680
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:16,727
People feel very, very deeply.

681
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:17,129
Yeah.

682
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:17,896
About things.

683
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:19,430
It is the most welcoming country

684
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:22,567
in Latin America that I've been.

685
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:30,568

This is the most northern part

690

of south America and borders
Venezuela in the east.

691
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:12,083
It is home to the seminomadic
people of Colombia.

692
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:14,585
They are a tough, autonomous

693
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,920
tribe who have never taken sides

694
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,623
with either the government
or FARC or paramilitary.

695
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,425
As a result they remained

696
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,659
independent politically and live

697
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:26,631
pretty much by their own code.

698
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:29,267
I'm meeting Juan Pablo, a chef

699
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,436

spot on a regular basis.

701
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,305
This is not another country.

702
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,341
This is Colombia but a very

703
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:38,276
different part of Colombia.

704
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:41,179
A very rugged terrain, desert.

705
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,614
There is not that much water.

706
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:47,452
So that is part of why the
Spaniards weren't able to

707
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:47,786
colonize it.

708
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:49,720
You've been coming
here for some time.

709
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,722
I became very interested in

710
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:57,328
the area because I like the

711
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:01,999
fresh fish, fresh lobster and

712
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,370
fresh shrimp and goat meat
to take back to Bogota.

713
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,172
Is it good?

714
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:08,038
Very good.

715
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,140
Goats are important.

716
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:16,881
They're used for Bart aring
and even doury payments.

717
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:21,219
Ranch owners come to sell,

718
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,989
saluter, cook goats
in the mornings.

719
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,259
Today we're having frichi.

720
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,595
It is a traditional fish.

721
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:38,102
It consists of the heart,
intestines of the goat.

722
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:40,371
They slaughter them back here

723
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:43,241
and this is where
the women cook it.

724
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:44,909
This is tradition.

725
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,943
This is breakfast.

726
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,679
This is breakfast.

727
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:55,686
The frichi.

728
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,922
A little bit of
everything in there.

729
00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:58,457
Yes.

730
00:35:58,458 --> 00:35:59,590
We have hearts.

731
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:06,431
We have a little bit
of meat, of ribs.

732
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:07,266
Now it's interesting, because

733
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:08,399
this one is for breakfast, and

734
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,701
it's almost done where
they are slaughtered.

735
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,403
They have to eat this fresh.

736
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,104
Fresh, this is delicious.

737
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,573
If not fresh, this
would not be so good.

738
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,941
No.

739
