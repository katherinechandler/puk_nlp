1
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,117
Chances are you haven't
been to this place.

2
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:21,689
Chances are this is a
place you've never seen,

3
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:28,061
other than maybe blurry
cell phone videos,

4
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:31,365
old black-and-white newsreels
from World War II.

5
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,800
Chances are bad things were

6
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:38,738
happening in the
footage you saw.

7
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,641
Myanmar: after 50
years of nightmare,

8
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,244
something unexpected
is happening here.

9
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,779
And it's pretty incredible.

10
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,793
In Yangon, capital city
of Myanmar, it's dark.

11
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:37,631
Blackouts are frequent with
the ancient power grid.

12
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,303
What sources of light there are

13
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:47,740
in the street cast an
eerie, yellow/orange hue.

14
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,310
For almost 100 years
under British rule,

15
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,978
this was Rangoon.

16
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,680
In 1948, after helping the

17
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,682
British fight off the Japanese,

18
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,650
and with a new taste for
self-determination, the

19
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,188
country gained independence.

20
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,826
After a decade of
instability, however,

21
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:11,231
the military consolidated
power and never let go.

22
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,332
Elections?

23
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,833
They came and went.

24
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,569
The results ignored,
opposition punished

25
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,372
or silenced entirely.

26
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,209
Burma, now Myanmar, where
Orwell had once served

27
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,178
as a colonial policeman,
where he'd first grown to

28
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,546
despise the apparatus of a

29
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,348
security state, became more

30
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,084
Orwellian than even he
could have imagined,

31
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,587
a nation where even
having an opinion

32
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,190
could be dangerous.

33
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,599
I am very honored to be here at

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,636
this university and to
be the first President

35
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,271
of the United States of America

36
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,705
to visit your country.

37
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,541
Morning in Yangon.

38
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,443
To nearly everyone's surprise,

39
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:59,045
there have been some huge
changes in recent months.

40
00:02:59,046 --> 00:02:59,980
The most difficult time

41
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,714
in any transition is when we

42
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,584
think that success is in sight.

43
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,886
Nobel Prize-winning
democracy champion

44
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,056
Aung San Suu Kyi, for
nearly 15 years under house

45
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,393
arrest, was released, and
has now taken an active

46
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,028
role in politics.

47
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,565
Just as the door is opening,

48
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,732
my crew and I are among

49
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,067
the first to record what has

50
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:25,004
been unseen for decades
by most of the world.

51
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,306
Meanwhile, this Southeast Asian

52
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,641
country of 80 million people

53
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,177
is collectively
holding its breath,

54
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,413
waiting to see what's next.

55
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:37,217
And will this loosening
of government grip last?

56
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,958
Of course, morning in Yangon

57
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,729
has always been about tea.

58
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,171
It's black, Indian-style tea,

59
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,673
usually with a thick dollop

60
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,444
of sweetened condensed milk.

61
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:09,382
You want it sweet, less
sweet, very sweet, strong,

62
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,318
less strong?

63
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,784
Everybody's got a preference;

64
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,487
everybody's got a
preferred tea shop

65
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:17,657
where they know, presumably,
how you like yours.

66
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:21,127
I said I'm only less
sweet, and a bit strong.

67
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,796
Journalist and
publisher U Thiha Saw.

68
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,198
We meet at the Say
Thai Cha Tea Shop.

69
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,301
Anything could happen
in a tea shop.

70
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,336
This place mean, uh, a lot

71
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:31,304
of things, not just a place for

72
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,341
breakfast and snacks.

73
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:38,144
For 50 years of
paranoia and repression,

74
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,180
tea houses were also the
main forum for guarded and

75
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,551
not-so-guarded discussions
of the daily news,

76
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,919
where you tried to piece
together the real stories

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,821
behind the ludicrously chopped

78
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,157
and censored newspapers.

79
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,392
Carefully, of course, because

80
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,026
informers and secret policese

81
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,995
were also heavily represented

82
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:59,366
in these hotbeds of
sedition and discontent.

83
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,500
So, given your profession,

84
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,601
how have you managed to stay out

85
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,503
of prison all of these years?

86
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,338
No. I was there.

87
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,406
Oh, really?

88
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,174
Two times.

89
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:07,941
Two times.

90
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:09,509
Once special Burma Police

91
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,177
called me. "Hey U Thiha Saw,

92
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:12,011
will you please come into office?
We need to talk."

93
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:12,413
Right.

94
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:17,083
So I went over there
and the total was...

95
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,720
89 days in the prison.

96
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,190
There was this very serious

97
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,593
control that came with the first

98
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:27,428
military government.

99
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,228
Right.

100
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,630
Press scrutiny and
registration debacle. So...

101
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,599
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

102
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,866
We need to send in our copies

103
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,902
to that office and then
take a look at everything.

104
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:36,936
They would say, "Take this out.

105
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,305
Take that out or black
this out," or just,

106
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,707
"Take the whole story out."

107
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,475
Magazines that would come

108
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:43,776
into the country would
they cut out...

109
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,712
Literally cut out
the-the pieces.

110
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:46,746
Well, the people under this

111
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,081
kind of tight censorship,
people become more,

112
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,417
I think, creative.

113
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:51,584
Take a look, careful reading,

114
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:55,455
there may be something
between the lines, messages.

115
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,590
Right. It was something
you were accused of, uh,

116
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,893
sending these secret messages.

117
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,567
In the back, a cauldron
of salty little fish

118
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,136
bubble over hardwood coals.

119
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:14,306
Fingers work mountains
of sweet bean,

120
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,242
one of the fillings for

121
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:18,244
the variety of pastries
that are stuffed, shaped,

122
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:21,715
and put into an old stone oven.

123
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,953
In another corner, the
heartening slap of

124
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,489
fresh bread, pressed
against the clay wall

125
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,190
of a tandoori.

126
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,159
And, of course, eggs
bob and spit in the

127
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,029
magical hell broth of
fish, spice, and herb.

128
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,598
Mohinga?

129
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:38,765
Uh, this I must have.

130
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,766
Correct me if I'm wrong,

131
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,834
if there's a national
dish, a fundamental,

132
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,437
most beloved dish, would
it be... would it be this?

133
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,372
Yeah, for example, take a
look at all this sweet

134
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:46,774
stuff.

135
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:48,107
This is Indian.

136
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,842
These are Chinese, et cetera.

137
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,512
But then mohinga
is a local thing.

138
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,613
And it's popular not in the city

139
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:54,781
but also in the rural areas,

140
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:58,718
too, in a fish base with
some rice or noodles.

141
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,454
We would sometimes we
put in some crispies,

142
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,156
like fried beans or...
fried guts.

143
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:04,825
Mm.

144
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:06,292
So, these are some
coriander leaves.

145
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:06,994
Yeah.

146
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:08,127
You can mix some-some limes.

147
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:12,265
Sprinkle some in here.

148
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,701
Mm. Good textures.

149
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:17,136
Particularly in the light of,

150
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,671
uh, Obama's recent visit,

151
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,373
these are interesting times.

152
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,642
Significant changes for the

153
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,711
first time in, you
know, 50 years.

154
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:25,646
Yeah.

155
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:27,580
There's one thing which
is quite significant.

156
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,215
For example, take a look around.

157
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:30,850
All kinds of people,
all age groups.

158
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,151
But a couple of years ago,

159
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,586
people would be... when you're

160
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:37,389
talking about politics,
you... you tone down.

161
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:37,658
Right.

162
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,991
I mean, you would be whispering.

163
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:39,760
But nowadays, people just being

164
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:41,994
more... are being, uh, outspoken.

165
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,196
So, this has all
become much more open.

166
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,364
In last July, they're sort of

167
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,534
relaxing the rules
about censorship.

168
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,001
August 20th, we were called

169
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,069
into the Unintel office,

170
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,271
we being publishers, editors.

171
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,506
And the director general of

172
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,074
the department said, the boss,

173
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:58,911
"Okay, 48 years and 20 days
of censorship is gone.

174
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,179
That's it."

175
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,615
Feel good?

176
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,016
Yeah. That's what we've been

177
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,417
waiting for so many years.

178
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,353
I love the-the-the answer.

179
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:08,521
It's a careful yes.

180
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,356
Yeah. First, people within

181
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,792
the country, we have
some doubt about,

182
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,595
"Okay, is it real, the
changes and the reforms?"

183
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,463
But, as now it's about a couple

184
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,232
of years, and then now
people start believing that,

185
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,901
"Oh, maybe, maybe it's real."

186
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,036
The process is still very young.

187
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,572
It is still possible when the

188
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:26,906
generals stop and think, "Okay,

189
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:27,940
that's enough is enough.

190
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,041
Let's turn back all our stuff

191
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,711
"I'm optimistic about the
changes and the reforms.

192
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,514
But I'm still
cautiously optimistic.

193
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,222
In Yangon, motorbikes
are outlawed.

194
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,058
Why is a matter of much
rumor and speculation.

195
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,361
So, it's the bus for me.

196
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,702
Something seems
almost out of sync.

197
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,643
Not too long ago, even
filming here officially

198
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,245
as an open, professional
Western film crew

199
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,148
would have been unthinkable.

200
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,785
In 2007, a Japanese journalist

201
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,453
was shot point-blank and killed

202
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:17,089
filming a street demonstration.

203
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,424
Be seen talking to anybody with

204
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,592
a camera and there would likely

205
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,596
be a knock on your door in
the middle of the night.

206
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,098
Yet so far, confronted
with our cameras,

207
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:30,002
a few smiles, and mostly
indifference at worst,

208
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,171
shocking considering how
recently the government

209
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,574
has started to relax its grip.

210
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:39,946
We love to eat.

211
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,948
And don't forget, for 50
years, we were under two

212
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,116
dictatorships, and
especially under some

213
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,886
socialists, you have not
a lot of things to do.

214
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:50,489
But, you know, cook and
share food and... you know.

215
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,659
This is Ma Thengi, a famous

216
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,663
and very controversial
figure in public life.

217
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,564
Myanmar or Burma?

218
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,799
Myanmar, because that's

219
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,503
original name since
the, uh, 13th century.

220
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,572
Ma Thengi, like U Thiha Saw,

221
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,741
has also spent time in prison.

222
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,976
But on emerging after three

223
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,477
years, she became in the minds

224
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,881
of many an apologist
for the regime.

225
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:18,084
Fairly or not, I
leave to others.

226
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,219
Sometimes, outsiders, um, act

227
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,321
as if, you know, it's only after

228
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,923
the military junta went away

229
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,892
that, you know, things happened.

230
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,159
First we were sort of, like, in

231
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,162
a fro... frozen state,
like Snow White.

232
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,898
Dead.

233
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,500
But her many well-known
books on the culinary

234
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,202
traditions of Myanmar

235
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,872
make her a compelling
advocate for Burmese cuisine.

236
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,174
So you're very passionate
about the cooking

237
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,509
and the cuisine here, and...

238
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,844
Well, it's just that I like

239
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,680
to eat and I eat like a pig.

240
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,484
This is Yangon's
field restaurant.

241
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,188
Salads, I think, are
the... the best of our food.

242
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,456
I'm going to order a lot of

243
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,758
salads that you haven't had.

244
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,792
You know, it's going to be like

245
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,060
a sort of a tasting thing.

246
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,796
There's pic head salad
with kaffir lime leaf,

247
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,766
long bean salad with
sesame and fish sauce,

248
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,301
penny leaf salad,
even this salad of

249
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,903
India-style samosa.

250
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,004
Everything's out there
at the same time.

251
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:12,639
Yes.

252
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,973
No first course, second course.

253
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:14,641
No, no, no, no.

254
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:16,308
If I'm invited to a friend's

255
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,778
house, the table would
be covered with dishes.

256
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,212
Right.

257
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:19,646
Covered.

258
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:20,880
And it's really about the

259
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,716
interaction between a lot
of colors, textures,

260
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:24,284
and flavors in one dish.

261
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,252
Yes. Yeah.

262
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:26,786
Or... Different.

263
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:27,654
Different.

264
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:28,721
Yeah.

265
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:29,389
Wow, I'm in love.

266
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:29,723
That's good.

267
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:32,725
Yes. It is.

268
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,761
And of course there's
the maddeningly

269
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,129
delicious condiments and
pickles with which to make

270
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,731
each dish your own.

271
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,000
You make a lot of different
combinations with each

272
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:41,802
mouthful.

273
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:43,235
Ah. And this is something

274
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,570
very confusing in general in

275
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:45,905
this part of the world.

276
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,740
Everybody eats everything
differently, to-

277
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,075
to very much to their taste.

278
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:49,910
Anything goes.

279
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,577
Anything goes.

280
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:51,744
You make-every mouthful you

281
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,414
can make as different
as you want.

282
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,935
Credit cards accepted
almost nowhere.

283
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,937
Cash machines, uh-uh.

284
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,638
Wi-Fi? Internet?

285
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,807
Rare.

286
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,775
3G? You got to be kidding.

287
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,277
If you need to exchange
money here, only crisp,

288
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,714
absolutely new $100
bills accepted.

289
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:32,419
In Myanmar, it's
another, older world.

290
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,130
Oh, and what's up with this?

291
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,499
With all the, uh, kissing
sounds, that smooching,

292
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,335
kissing, you know,
sound that you're

293
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:50,136
hearing all over the place?

294
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,872
My wife would have been in,
like, 10 fights so far.

295
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:56,008
Sorry? Who... who are
you smooching at?

296
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,243
Bitch?

297
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,345
This is how you summon a waiter

298
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,480
in Myanmar. I know. I know.

299
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,849
Try that at Hooters and you

300
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,650
will be rightly ejected.

301
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,020
It takes some getting
used to, for sure.

302
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:11,023
Min lane is a big, noisy
seafood house where fish

303
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,525
is prepared in the
style of Rhakine,

304
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,726
the coastal province to the

305
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:19,098
west named for the Rhakine
people, one of over 135

306
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,367
distinct ethnic
groups around here.

307
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,870
See, now we're talking Prawn
curry is one of those-

308
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:24,737
one of those things everybody

309
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,372
tells you you got to eat here.

310
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:30,109
Prawns from the river,
in tomato curry.

311
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,778
I tell you this, good sauce.

312
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,113
Oh, that's good.

313
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,348
That is some good
shit, my friends.

314
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,920
We shall know them by the
number of their dead.

315
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,727
Early morning in Yangon.

316
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,262
Among the crush of commuters,

317
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:54,533
shoppers, people trying
to make a living,

318
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,870
rise up the last remnants
of empire, faded,

319
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,906
often crumbling, but still there

320
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,740
after all these years.

321
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,943
These are the
offices, businesses,

322
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:07,447
and public buildings of
the British colonials.

323
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,324
The Sofaer building was once

324
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:22,295
one of the swankest
department stores in Rangoon.

325
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:26,999
A century ago, when Kipling's

326
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
poem "Mandalay" was beckoning

327
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,436
the overheated imaginations of

328
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,570
a generation of young

329
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,339
Englishmen, here you could buy

330
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,943
fine Egyptian cigarettes,
French liqueurs.

331
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:40,779
The floor tiles were shipped
over from Manchester.

332
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,282
Now, people live here.

333
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,750
A half-century as a pariah

334
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,085
state has left very few of

335
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,587
these buildings in good repair.

336
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,089
And there are divergent views

337
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,690
on whether to preserve them.

338
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,961
For many, a reminder of
colonial subjugation.

339
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:58,831
For others, a vestige
of a golden time.

340
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,141
These days in Myanmar in the

341
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:10,709
streets, on the docks, it's all

342
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,211
about moving forward.

343
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,845
In an economy ripe to explode

344
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,381
if things continue trending in

345
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,782
their current direction,

346
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,050
the busy hustle and bustle of

347
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,286
Yangon's port appears even

348
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,021
busier today as workers prepare

349
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,291
for the oncoming holiday.

350
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:31,230
Hey, Chef. How are you doing?

351
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,465
It firgures, doesn't it?

352
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,700
Yeah, it does.

353
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,135
Welcome to Myanmar.

354
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,804
Philippe Lajaunie,
owner/proprietor of my old

355
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,406
restaurant, Les Halles.

356
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,641
It seems only natural that, uh,

357
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,477
you'd be in Burma, Myanmar,
at the same time as me.

358
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,678
Back before anything, before I

359
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,081
wrote the book that changed
my life from broke-ass

360
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:52,318
utility-grade chef to
whatever it is I am today,

361
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,819
I'd never been to Asia

362
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,988
until this guy sent me to Japan

363
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,358
and got me hooked
on a continent.

364
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,327
But there we go.

365
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:01,860
Oh, nice.

366
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:02,894
Chicken head.

367
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:03,663
Yeah.

368
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:06,498
That is the perfect
mood awakener.

369
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,499
Oh, yeah.

370
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,335
Philippe travels constantly.

371
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,038
He's been bouncing
around Asia for decades.

372
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,405
Like all good travelers,

373
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,174
he's relentlessly curious and

374
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,176
without fear or prejudice.

375
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,610
It's fantastic.

376
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,878
It makes perfect sense, then,

377
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,280
that over cold brew and chicken

378
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,914
necks in the Port of Yangon,

379
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,516
Philippe is the one joining me

380
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:28,188
to explore this particular
moment in Myanmar.

381
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,024
That's the money tree.

382
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,593
Oh, it is going to be a party.

383
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,329
Yeah.

384
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,532
Full moon party tonight.

385
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,900
Full moon party, that's right.

386
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,135
Now, what that
means, we have no idea.

387
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,203
We don't know.

388
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,174
There is only one way
to find out, I suppose.

389
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:56,641
♪ ♪

390
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,718
Well, it sounds like a party.

391
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,555
Oh, it gets crazy from now on.

392
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,493
It's Dsong Dai, Full Moon Day,

393
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,129
a holiday marking the end
of the rainy season.

394
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,598
And today marks the
beginning of three days of

395
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,067
Break Out the Crazy.

396
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,503
Giant speakers compete for

397
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,405
attention, everybody cheerfully

398
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,908
oblivious to the distortion.

399
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,978
Cotton candy, trinkets,
tube socks, just like

400
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,248
a New York street fair,
but with infinitely

401
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,883
better food.

402
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,752
Oh, are these the little birds?

403
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,955
Yeah. These guys
are really good.

404
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,990
Was flying just a bit
earlier this morning.

405
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,592
I'll tell you, it's the
backbone of every street

406
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,961
fair in the world, isn't
it, deep-fried food?

407
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,130
That's right.

408
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,432
And here they also have
the-the little, uh, uh,

409
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,801
batter, where they break
a quail egg in it.

410
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,103
One shot.

411
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,338
It's really good.

412
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,939
That's it? He's happy?

413
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,006
All right.

414
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,275
This is so tasty.

415
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,277
Much less greasy than I
thought it would be.

416
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,778
In fact, rather delicate.

417
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,713
Yeah, any time you tell
me "crispy little bird,"

418
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:02,682
I'm all over it.

419
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,983
Good head. Good beak, too.

420
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:05,885
Good beak.

421
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:07,953
Crispy and tender.

422
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,422
Oh, and they have rides.

423
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,023
Check this out.

424
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,627
Okay, it's a Ferris wheel,
but the power source,

425
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,797
not unusual for these
parts, is not electric.

426
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,399
It ain't gas.

427
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,370
Oh man, are you kidding me?

428
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:29,074
It's human power.

429
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,678
You have to see
it to believe it.

430
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,514
An absolutely
insanely dangerous,

431
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,149
closely choreographed process

432
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,550
of first getting the giant,

433
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,719
heavily-laden wheel in motion,

434
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,388
and then getting it up to top

435
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,892
speed and keeping it there.

436
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:49,896
Wow.

437
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,964
Look at this thing
tilting out, too.

438
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,934
That's the break.

439
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,937
Three guys the other way.

440
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,072
Note the footwear, by the way.

441
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,208
And it's not just this one.

442
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,509
Every couple of blocks, bigger

443
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,277
and bigger Ferris wheels,

444
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:09,080
each one with its own troop
of acrobatic spinners.

445
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,518
And sure, going for a
ride is tempting, but...

446
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,454
"CNN host implicated in death of

447
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,623
four underage carnies."

448
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,725
That's the thing just
came off the hinges,

449
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:20,527
and next thing you know

450
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:21,361
it was rolling down the street

451
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:22,728
and sending those kids flying.

452
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,129
"If I'd had any idea, I never

453
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,732
would have taken a
ride," says Bourdain.

454
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,033
No, I don't think so.

455
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,135
Hard making a buck. But again

456
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,803
and again, the seats are loaded

457
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,906
with smiling families,
the team climbs aboard,

458
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,642
and the circus begins again.

459
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:37,709
Good luck.

460
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,545
May you return to earth safely,

461
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,348
with all of your limbs intact.

462
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:01,099
Next day in the
Full Moon Festival.

463
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,167
And whether you're looking out

464
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:05,104
the window at a rural village..

465
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,476
Or at the streets of Yangon,

466
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:13,945
what's happening is
probably pretty similar,

467
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,582
a tableau of dancing,
body painting,

468
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,751
car-mounted speakers blasting.

469
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,661
But it's also three
days of merit accruing,

470
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:30,829
the practice of performing

471
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,264
charitable or otherwise good

472
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:35,534
works in the hopes of
jacking up your karma.

473
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,836
Money trees are paraded around

474
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,506
pinned with cash
donations for monks.

475
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,508
Free banquets and
feasts are held.

476
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,245
And many moments of
spiritual reflection.

477
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,682
The majority of people here

478
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,552
practice Theravada
Buddhism, the oldest,

479
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,820
most conservative form of the

480
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,355
religion, which, simply put,

481
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,856
asserts that existence isut,

482
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,391
pretty much a continuous cycle

483
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:03,796
of suffering through
birth, death, and rebirth.

484
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,169
Noisy today.

485
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,005
Very noisy, very noisy, yes.

486
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,243
The Morning Star Tea
House, where I've come,

487
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,978
well, for a couple of reasons.

488
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:23,214
Reason one: the must-have,
bone-deep, old-school

489
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,518
favorite around here, La
Pet Tok, the salad of

490
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,720
fermented tea leaves. I know.

491
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,689
That does not sound good.

492
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,393
But you'd be wrong
to think that.

493
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,429
Take the fermented tea leaves.

494
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,197
Add cabbage, tomatoes,

495
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,000
lots and lots of crunchy
bits like toasted peanuts,

496
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,603
season with lime and fish sauce.

497
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,271
This is absolutely delicious.

498
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,073
You like it?

499
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:47,907
Oh, yeah. It's fantastic.

500
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:49,441
Yes, yes, fantastic.

501
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,209
Simple, delicious.

502
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,243
Things not to be taken for

503
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,445
granted if you've been in and

504
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,280
out of the joint like this guy,

505
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,216
Zarni Bo, activist, astrologer,

506
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,785
and three-times convict.

507
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,252
Yeah, everyone I've met in this

508
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,089
country so far, in fact,
has been to prison.

509
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,457
It-it seems, uh.

510
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:05,425
Yes, this happens again and

511
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:06,792
again for us in Myanmar.

512
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:07,893
For almost six-six years?

513
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:08,960
Six years, nearly six years.

514
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:09,762
About six years.

515
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:10,597
All the judgments are

516
00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:12,030
made by the kangaroo court. The

517
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,765
navy, army, and the air force,

518
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:16,267
these three officials are
sitting all together.

519
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,769
They read off, uh, "This is your

520
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,770
sentence," like that.

521
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:19,639
Right.

522
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,772
It happens. Only minutes.

523
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,574
Pst, like that.

524
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:24,410
Uh, what is life
like inside prison?

525
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:25,578
Nice, nice, very nice.

526
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,580
I have a hard
time believing that.

527
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:29,215
No. Very nice.

528
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:31,216
We can talk to each other,

529
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,283
you know, saying some things.

530
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,652
And we use a mirror to look each

531
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:34,820
other. It's very nice.

532
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,254
Access to books?

533
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,623
No book. No writing thing.

534
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:38,890
No paper.

535
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,659
No, nothing at all.

536
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,464
A mat and a blanket and
a plate and a bowl.

537
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:46,065
Right.

538
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:48,133
Only these are the
things that we possess.

539
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,801
How's the food,
the food in prison?

540
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,671
Soup. Rice with pea soup,

541
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,674
only one meat meal for a week.

542
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:56,775
That's on Thursday.

543
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,411
You know that in prison,
it ends in prison.

544
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,312
All the fish has no body,

545
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,314
only the head and the tail.

546
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,151
No middle part.

547
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,654
I can look like that.

548
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:10,321
So, there is hope for this

549
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,823
country in your view, yes?

550
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,592
Yes, yes, especially with the

551
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,827
Buddhist belief, you know,

552
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,162
how to live in situations.

553
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,697
Dictators, you know, and the

554
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,766
political pressures, or even

555
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,502
discrimination, everything
is happening to us.

556
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,603
But the Buddhists say,

557
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,005
"Okay, that's about
past life love.

558
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,842
If we go do something, the
next life will be good."

559
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,647
There's something
pretty cool about meeting

560
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:39,184
people who've been, for
so long, unable to speak,

561
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,686
now so unguarded about

562
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:43,790
their hopes and their feelings.

563
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:52,865
♪ ♪

564
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,347
Sizzling meats, the
clink of beer glasses,

565
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:11,149
ringing bicycle bells.

566
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,852
This is Yangon's 19th Street.

567
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:17,388
Does Yangon rock? Can it rock?

568
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:21,392
19th Street is like a
must-go place when you are

569
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,394
in Yangon.

570
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,665
Meet Burmese punk
rockers Side Effect and

571
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,667
lead singer Darko.

572
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,570
Uh, you can come here anytime.

573
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,705
It will be lots of
people, like here.

574
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:34,873
So, if you sit here long

575
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:37,242
enough, you'll see every
musician in town?

576
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:40,045
Yeah, you could say that.

577
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,713
The citywide
curfew used to mean,

578
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,682
"Close your doors at 11 p.m."

579
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:45,917
Most shops and restaurants
still close early,

580
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,953
but not here on 19th Street,

581
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:50,556
where you can eat barbecue
late into the night.

582
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:51,723
Wow.

583
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:52,424
What do we have here?

584
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:53,525
What, uh, grilled tofu?

585
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:54,126
Yeah.

586
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:55,426
And this is a pork tail.

587
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,427
Pork tail, oh.

588
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,863
Yeah.

589
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,931
This barbecue is awesome.

590
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,267
These young men show exactly
how determined you've

591
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:06,805
got to be to rock,
especially in Burma.

592
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:10,942
I like to say my early
influence was Nirvana.

593
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:14,079
And then, Sex Pistols, Ramones,

594
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,047
and stuff like that.

595
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,449
What American bands do you hate?

596
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,287
Especially, uh, um, Creed.

597
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:23,089
Yes.

598
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:23,956
Yeah.

599
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:27,959
They are, like, the
worst band in the history

600
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,063
of, like, the world.

601
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:36,467
So, what's it like having
an indie band in Myanmar?

602
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,236
Is it a little difficult?

603
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,738
For sure. For sure, yeah.

604
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:42,340
Before you reconnaissance or,

605
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:43,474
you know, like, when you got

606
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,645
the lyrics, you got
to submit the lyrics.

607
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,513
So they're going to censor it.

608
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:49,815
They're going to check it.

609
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:53,251
And even sometimes they-
they will, you know,

610
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:56,087
suggest to you some
words to change.

611
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,488
Oh, that must be funny.

612
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,791
Very funny, actually, you know?

613
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,760
Now, is that still the case?

614
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:03,829
Now, it's not like that anymore.

615
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,996
They're not going to censor you.

616
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,665
But it's going to be kind of

617
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,199
risky, because you don't know

618
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,701
what's going to happen to you

619
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:12,739
if you write and sing
something wrong.

620
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,807
So, let me ask this:
if all your dreams

621
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:18,810
came true, where would
you want to play?

622
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:19,712
New York City.

623
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:21,146
You want to go to New York City?

624
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,782
Yeah. Oh, it's my dream.

625
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:26,217
You just need to be
strong, so that's what...

626
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,854
That's what I keep
telling my band mates,

627
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,689
you know, "Come on, be strong.

628
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,523
Have faith."

629
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:33,892
So. So I hope people
reach out to you,

630
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:36,027
because making rock 'n'
roll is hard enough.

631
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:39,631
Truly independent rock
'n' roll is even harder.

632
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,700
And I'm guessing that making it

633
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,501
here is harder still.

634
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:46,705
So, gentlemen, you
deserve some success.

635
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:49,175
People should hear you.

636
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,392
So, you heard the sleeping
car lost a wheel?

637
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:08,194
The what?

638
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:09,061
The sleeping car lost a

639
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:11,096
wheel, uh, and the dining car.

640
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,097
So, we get a new.

641
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,699
Well, no, we lost the
dining car, I hear.

642
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,733
We lost the dining car,

643
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:17,068
but even our original
sleeping car lost a wheel.

644
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,906
So, we just have to
hope for the best.

645
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,343
The night express to Bagan,

646
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,112
600 kilometers of what will

647
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:31,116
turn out to be kidney-softening
travel by rail.

648
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,918
But Bagan, Myanmar's ancient

649
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,787
capital, I've been
told, is a must-see.

650
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:38,289
The true old English experience.

651
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,292
The engine is a French
engine from the '70s.

652
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:44,095
We've been told it's a
somewhat uncomfortable

653
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,698
10-hour trip.

654
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:47,633
So really, the question on

655
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,467
this end of the journey is:

656
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:52,570
come back on the train
or flying coffin?

657
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:55,540
Mishaps on both Burmese
planes and trains are not,

658
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:58,643
shall we say, unheard of.

659
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,211
The Widowmaker Express.

660
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,114
That is the choice.

661
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,951
So, that may be the signal to,

662
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:07,152
uh, depart at some point.

663
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:08,587
Yeah. All aboard?

664
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,163
Whoa, we're moving.

665
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,231
Here we go.

666
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,633
Here we go.

667
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,438
Oh, that's it.

668
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,840
We have reached our
cruising, uh, speed.

669
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,608
Really? This is
cruising speed, we think?

670
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:31,977
Just a bit.

671
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:33,745
You could literally
outrun this train.

672
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:34,980
We could jog ahead,

673
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:37,182
have a nice meal in some, uh,

674
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,417
you know, recommended,
uh, restaurant.

675
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:40,352
We could catch up with it.

676
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:44,290
It's like the
digestive, uh, walk.

677
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,694
There we go.

678
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:52,064
This is stop number one of 75.

679
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,385
Heading north, the
scenery opens up.

680
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,721
The space between
things gets wider,

681
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:20,526
more pastoral, and
more beautiful.

682
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,233
Looking around at my
fellow passengers,

683
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,634
it could be hard to distinguish

684
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:32,070
between the 135-plus ethnic

685
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:36,074
groups that make up the
Burmese population.

686
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,342
The very name "Burma"

687
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:42,347
refers actually to only
one of these groups.

688
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,549
What they all seem to
have in common, however,

689
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,518
is thanaka, a face paint
and sunblock made

690
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,923
from tree bark that masks
many of their faces.

691
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,324
It's ubiquitous here.

692
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,926
At first jarring to see,

693
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:56,394
it quickly becomes something

694
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:59,731
you get used to and
take for granted.

695
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:20,285
Yangon's gravitational
pull broken,

696
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:21,552
and with darkness falling,

697
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,189
the train picks up speed.

698
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,361
At times, terrifyingly so.

699
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:34,966
I mean, this thing is going

700
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,569
to derail at some point.

701
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,771
They have lost how many wheels

702
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,808
yesterday on this one train?

703
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:46,811
So, truly, it's about
being in the right car,

704
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:49,314
the one that keeps its wheel.

705
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:51,482
Derailments, or "rail slips,"

706
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,817
as they are referred to here,

707
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,319
a somewhat more benign-sounding

708
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,654
occurrence than, say,
"Rolling off the tracks into

709
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:57,989
a rice paddy,"

710
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,126
are not uncommon.

711
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,730
And one can't help wondering

712
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,132
what the engineer and conductor

713
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,633
are thinking as the trainductor

714
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:13,139
speeds heedlessly on,
faster and faster.

715
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,674
I mean, it must be, what,
about 40, 50 miles per

716
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:17,909
hour at this point.

717
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,677
I wonder if anyone has ever,

718
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:19,578
like, flown right out of their

719
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,279
seat, out the window.

720
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,182
Yes, small people, sure.

721
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,918
You don't want to be,
like, holding a lap dog.

722
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,353
Or a baby, or anything.

723
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:30,688
I mean, it's...
Try pissing in the

724
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,358
bathroom and find yourself
launched straight up

725
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,760
into the ceiling, bringing
to a rude conclusion

726
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:40,566
what was already an
omnidirectional experience.

727
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,203
It's smooth now.

728
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:47,239
It's very relaxing.

729
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,675
What kind of beer did he have?

730
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52,344
I want the same.

731
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,648
Samosa?

732
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:30,482
Yes.

733
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:31,749
Yeah.

734
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,718
1,000?

735
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,320
Done.

736
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:39,090
Now, this is breakfast.

737
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,926
Nearly 19 hours
into our 10-hour trip,

738
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,428
and the night express to Bagan

739
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,696
lurches and bounces onward over

740
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:49,434
old and poorly
maintained tracks.

741
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:52,370
Could have flown back to
New York for breakfast.

742
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:53,771
I-I had time.

743
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:57,042
What's in yours? Carrots.

744
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,677
Root. I got potatoes in mine.

745
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,346
How to make good food pretty.

746
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:02,380
Look at this.

747
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:03,848
A bouquet of fish.

748
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,884
Indeed.

749
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:12,424
So, this is it.

750
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:15,361
This is the Plain of Bagan.

751
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:21,632
Out the window, the modern

752
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,301
world seems to fade away, ern

753
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,703
then disappear altogether,

754
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,072
like the last century never

755
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:31,410
happened, or even the
century before that.

756
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,046
We're traveling across the

757
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:39,117
largest mainland nation
in Southeast Asia.

758
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:40,418
But it should be pointed out

759
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:41,486
that we are still within the

760
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:44,755
confines of the
tourist triangle,

761
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:48,426
areas permissible for travel.

762
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:51,162
Whole sectors of this
country, much of it, in fact,

763
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:54,999
are off-limits. Simply put,

764
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,804
there is shit going on they
do not want you to see.

765
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,606
A low-intensity conflict with

766
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:04,442
the ethnic Kachin tribe
would be one of them,

767
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:09,580
a wave of persecution and
deaths in Rhakine state.

768
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,982
The country may be opening
up at its center,

769
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,518
but all along the edges it's

770
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,520
waging a desperate war to hang

771
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:18,156
on to the status quo.

772
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:22,628
Needless to say, the
status quo is not good.

773
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,035
All right.

774
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,772
Bagan, here we come.

775
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:50,221
1,000 years ago, Bagan
was the capital for a

776
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:53,791
long line of Bama kings.

777
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,959
It's the sort of place where

778
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,230
the old coexists
with the even older.

779
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:00,166
As elsewhere in this part of

780
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,833
the world, in many of the
Buddhist temples here,

781
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,203
far older animist spirit-based

782
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:09,207
beliefs coexist with
more recent Buddhism.

783
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,409
And, in Myanmar,
worship of the Nats

784
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,344
is widespread.

785
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,814
Nats, as I understand it,
are more like Greek gods,

786
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,816
former humans, demigods,

787
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,585
spirits, often with very human

788
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,820
qualities and failings.

789
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,425
Dance performances pay homage

790
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,594
to the individual Nats,

791
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,262
performers claiming to actually

792
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,863
channel them, bringing about,

793
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:37,736
one hopes, a beneficial
spiritual possession.

794
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,743
But I'm not just
here for a Nat Pwey.

795
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:46,944
I have a list:

796
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,180
things to eat in Myanmar.

797
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,881
And this is one of them.

798
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,284
Chicken curry.

799
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:55,286
And from roadside
joints like this,

800
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:56,954
nestled among the temple ruins,

801
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:57,889
you're more than likely touins,

802
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,293
catch a very enticing whiff.

803
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:03,594
Just delicious.

804
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,463
Spicy, but not to the point
that you want to scream

805
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:09,133
out for mercy, but some heat.

806
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:10,134
Slow simmered curry,

807
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,036
served with a side of sour soup

808
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:14,372
made from roselle leaves.

809
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,307
With it, you get
fried, ground chilies,

810
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:19,109
pickled bean sprouts...
You get the idea.

811
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,945
They always have,
like, these relishes,

812
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:22,247
these dippy type things, these,

813
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:24,549
like, really interesting
salads, and I'm, like,

814
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,551
not really a salad guy.

815
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:29,554
The salads here are,
uh... they're happening.

816
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:32,457
Spicy, sour, salty,
savory, just delicious.

817
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,225
It's delicious.

818
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:35,826
A plethora of
textures and flavors.

819
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:36,827
This is a culture that's

820
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,095
thought a lot about their food,

821
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:41,666
clearly like eating,
like feeding people.

822
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:42,667
They think a lot about those

823
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:48,673
classic balances of flavors,
colors, and textures.

824
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:51,477
Best restaurant in the
country so far, by the way.

825
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,501
You'd expect this, an ancient

826
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:19,670
city of nearly unparalleled
size and beauty,

827
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,372
to be overrun with tourists,

828
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:25,343
souvenir shops, snack
bars, tours on tape...

829
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,344
But no.

830
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:29,448
Oh, this is stunning.

831
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,649
You'll encounter some
Western travelers at

832
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,318
Bagan's temple sites for sure,

833
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:36,554
but, generally speaking,
they're a hardy bunch...

834
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:37,888
Even the bus tours here are not

835
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:41,627
for the faint of heart
or the weak of spirit.

836
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,027
But for the most part,

837
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,228
you're far more likely to bump

838
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:47,031
into a goat than a foreigner.

839
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:52,737
This is so beautiful, so
much like an ode to human,

840
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,639
you know, beliefs and adoration

841
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,075
and worshiping
and-and... Slave labor.

842
00:37:58,076 --> 00:37:59,477
And slave labor.

843
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:01,679
I'm thinking, you build
this many temples,

844
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,081
thousands of them, in
a relatively short

845
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:04,883
period of time?

846
00:38:04,884 --> 00:38:05,884
You know, chances are somebody

847
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:07,552
was working for less
than minimum wage,

848
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:08,653
let's put it that way.

849
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,254
For sure.

850
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:13,658
Ah, we could fly here.

851
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:14,892
Look at that.

852
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:18,229
Whew.

853
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:26,236
A millennia ago, in
a period of just under

854
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:30,274
250 years, over 4,000
structures like this

855
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,478
were built here.

856
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:34,879
They say that a Bama king,

857
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,882
Anorata, began this project
after a conversion to

858
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:41,820
Theravada-style Buddhism.

859
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:46,425
They started a new temple,
like, every 14 days.

860
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:52,096
Over 3,000 pagodas,
temples, and monasteries

861
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:53,631
remain today.

862
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:57,067
Inside almost every one
of them, a Buddha figure,

863
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,804
each one different.

864
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:02,440
And I like how integrated
it is with those

865
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:04,775
trees, ox trails, and...

866
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,477
Actually, funny you
should mention that.

867
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,813
People used to live here,
but the government came

868
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:10,781
along in the '80s, I believe,

869
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,283
and relocated... it was a
mass relocation project.

870
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:13,952
Right.

871
00:39:13,953 --> 00:39:15,920
So, any homes, anything, it

872
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,122
was understood that this
is a good... you know,

873
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,289
there's some tourist bucks here.

874
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,394
They relocated the
entire population.

875
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:30,501
We're in one of the first
mass waves of tourists.

876
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:31,769
European tourists have been

877
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,103
coming here in relatively small

878
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,072
numbers for a long time.

879
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:36,106
But the floodgates
have certainly opened.

880
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,141
They're building hotels like

881
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:40,144
crazy around this area,
what's called the

882
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,145
Tourist Triangle.

883
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:42,647
I really like this, too.

884
00:39:42,648 --> 00:39:44,982
This is silk and cotton poly.

885
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,984
And what-what is this here?
Oh, this-this is a...

886
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,454
This is a nice cloth.

887
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:50,488
As Myanmar begins

888
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,156
its shift towards accommodating

889
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,591
increasing tourism and a

890
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:55,526
service economy to go with it,

891
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:57,862
there will be adjustments.

892
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:00,531
There will be, of
course, a downside.

893
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,433
Now, how much you pay?

894
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:03,168
Okay.

895
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:05,369
What's that going to mean?
How will the Burmese

896
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,638
react to all of the goods-good

897
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,007
and evils that
come with tourism?

898
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:10,842
Okay, Mister.

899
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:12,677
What about... you pay one. Okay.

900
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:13,445
Perfect. It's perfect, yeah.

901
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:14,045
Excuse me.

902
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:15,646
It's going to mean mobility.

903
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,682
It's going to mean
prosperity for some.

904
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:19,484
Will mean a lot of bad
things, too, you know.

905
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:20,685
It'll mean prostitution;

906
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:22,119
it'll mean hustling.

907
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,153
Here you go. Okay, my booth

908
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,154
Unintel fine restaurant.

909
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,157
Okay. And you, too.

910
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:27,993
Everybody is selling to you,

911
00:40:27,994 --> 00:40:30,828
you buy Unintel, you
pay 20, you buy...

912
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:31,730
I know, I know.

913
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:32,797
But you don't buy postcard.

914
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:33,665
Now, that's no fair.

915
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:34,566
You buy postcard, also fair.

916
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:35,900
But I don't need the postcard.

917
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,334
We're told that
kids are dropping out

918
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,004
of school to do this, the
double-edged sword of

919
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,371
the service economy.

920
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,540
You want to buy postcard?

921
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:43,974
For, uh, only $5.

922
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,476
One, two, three, more, five,

923
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:47,112
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

924
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,486
What I'm amazed is how
friendly and open people

925
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:56,187
are with us.

926
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:58,055
It's very easy for me to sit

927
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,858
here and say whatever I
want about the government.

928
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:01,493
Right?

929
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:03,193
We can go home.

930
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,162
You know.

931
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:06,565
Our lives will go on.

932
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,836
We don't pay the
price for that show.

933
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:14,404
Uh, everybody who helped us

934
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,841
could very well pay that price.

935
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:17,875
It should be pointed out that a

936
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,510
lot of people did not.

937
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,278
A lot of people were very
nice to us but said,

938
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:24,248
"Look, I just... I've
already been in jail."

939
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:26,250
You know?" I don't... I
really don't want to

940
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,417
go back."

941
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,219
Um, it's a very real concern.

942
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,188
What happens to the
people we leave behind?

943
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,023
You know, one would think that

944
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:34,592
you can't... once freedom...
You know, they've tasted

945
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:35,293
freedom, you know?

946
00:41:35,294 --> 00:41:40,230
Well, uh, uh, you know, you
can put the toothpaste

947
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,365
back in the tube.

948
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:41,933
You know?

949
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:44,603
Uh, there's no doubt about that.

950
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,137
But for the moment at least,

951
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:50,474
things seem to be moving
in the right direction.

952
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:53,578
A country closed off
to most for so long,

953
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:55,813
sleeping, a 50-year
nightmare for

954
00:41:55,814 --> 00:42:00,450
many of its citizens,
finally may be waking up.

955
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:01,586
To what?

956
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:03,521
Time will tell.
