1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,504
Peru is a country that's

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,206
historically driven men mad, mad

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:10,543
for gold, for cocoa, for its
magical ancient history.

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,512
Now, there's something else

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,715
drawing outsiders to its
hidden mountain valleys.

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:16,716
We love the stuff.

7
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:22,755
We obsess about it, gorge
on it and felty size it.

8
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,324
I'm talking about chocolate,

9
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:27,927
once a common treat, it's now

10
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,463
becoming as nuanced as fine wine

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,000
making the pursuit of the
raw good stuff all the more

12
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:34,268
difficult.

13
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:37,036
Item joining that hunt in

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,771
remotest Peru, but not before

15
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:46,772
I've reimmersed myself in the
booming Lima food scene.

I'm in Peru with this guy, Eric.

00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,039
He was looking at this,
he went into the tree.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,975
That's funny.

25
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:51,544
Chef of the world famous
restaurant in New York.

26
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,346
To look at where chocolate comes

27
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:58,185
from, particularly our
chocolate, the very expensive

28
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,052
limited run designer chocolate

29
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,255
barbs Eric got me
into last year.

30
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,557
So that's why we're in Peru.

31
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,859
Before we get all Indiana Jones,

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,128
we're spending some time in

33
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,632
Lima, as we like the
capital city just fine.

34
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:17,170
We have both of us, from
previous trips, friends here.

35
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:20,707
Lima is the cultural hub and

36
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,575
culinary capital of a country

37
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,477
that has exploded in the last

38
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:28,381
decade with scores of world
class cooks, chefs and

39
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:28,682
restaurants.

40
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,283
It has long been considered to

41
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,185
be one of the best food scenes

42
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,554
in all of south America.

43
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,123
Good.

44
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:37,825
Five minutes.

45
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:44,731
One of our friends here
is chef restaurateur as

46
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,299
circumstance er, one of the best

47
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,134
most successful chefs
in the country.

48
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:51,304
His family is a beloved culinary

49
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,240
dynasty in Peru and a small

50
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,774
fishing village about an hour

51
00:02:54,775 --> 00:03:00,481
south of Lima is where
they spend their weekends.

52
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:12,792
His mom is like Peru's Julia

53
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:16,429
Childs and James beard
rolled into one.

54
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,197
Thank you for having us.

55
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,934
An icon of Peruvian astronomy.

56
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,904
To say one is fortunate to enjoy

57
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:29,041
her hospitality would
be an understatement.

58
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,846
Warm, generous, welcoming
beyond belie belief.

59
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,214
Too bad you have
to leave so soon.

60
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,251
Yeah.

61
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:41,921
Normally, we have lunch
late, like 5:00.

62
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,723
Do you nap before
lunch or after?

63
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,957
Both.

64
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,127
Sounds like paradise.

65
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:48,496
Wow.

66
00:03:48,497 --> 00:03:50,129
Look at this.

67
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,631
Every weekend, Marissa opens

68
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,266
the house to an ever changing

69
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:56,436
mob of friends, visitors,
drop kins and family.

70
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,104
This is fantastic.

71
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,574
They do not skimp on the food.

72
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,875
Delicious, delicious things pour

73
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,312
out of the kitchen, a torrent, a

74
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:08,581
deluge of traditional
Peruvian favorites.

75
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:14,053
I do this with crab meat,
yellow potato and avocado.

76
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,622
We love avocado.

77
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,224
It is like a touring of crab

78
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:23,863
meat, avocado and mashed
yellow potatoe potatoes.

79
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:24,897
This is from the coast.

80
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,032
Beautiful.

81
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:29,936
Basically raw king fish

82
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,838
fillets dressed with lime juice.

83
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,440
Perfect.

84
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:37,544
That's scallops cerricha.

85
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:42,515
Fresh scallops and lemon
juice and garlic.

86
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:46,853
Drum fish, braised with
a corn based beer.

87
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:51,691
They look fantastic.

88
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,959
This is spicy.

89
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,494
Very spicy.

90
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,664
And stuffed riccotti peppers

91
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,332
filled with ground beef and

92
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,369
raisins, served with cheese.

93
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,436
Wow.

94
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,271
Are we lucky or what?

95
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,506
We are lucky.

96
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,341
That's just the beginning.

97
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,642
There's so much more food

98
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,277
there's no way we can show it

99
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,045
all much less describe it.

100
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,850
It's incredible, overwhelming,

101
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:18,751
invariably fresh and delicious

102
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:22,054
and different than
what I'm used to.

103
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:22,590
That's fantastic.

104
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:25,024
I could get out of the
chocolate business right now,

105
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:28,995
put up a pup tent on Marissa's

106
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,563
porch and dig in
for the duration.

107
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,699
This is living.

108
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,101
They're so fresh.

109
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,070
I want to be her
next door neighbor.

110
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,039
It's so good.

111
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,375
So as Peruvian cuisine always

112
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:45,144
been this diverse and this
delicious and we're just

113
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,679
discovering it or has it changed

114
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,381
over the last 15 years?

115
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:51,283
It's challenging any way.

116
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,820
What you're eating now
is the traditional food.

117
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:57,490
There's so many products in

118
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,492
Peru different than the states.

119
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,761
When you eat this food,
it's something like.

120
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:06,265
Not kind of like anything.

121
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,300
It's all year-round.

122
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,368
It is very good.

123
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,270
What do you do when you're

124
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,773
homesick for Peruvian food
and you're traveling?

125
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:19,412
There's really... we
take some chiles with us

126
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:23,883
in the luggage.

127
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,986
I hate to say good-bye to
this but it is what it is.

128
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,555
Things to do and places to go.

129
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:31,691
Wild and apparently extremely

130
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,293
rare cocoa trees to visit.

131
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,828
Incredibly rare.

132
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:39,165
So happy.

133
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,267
♪

134
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:46,305
♪

135
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,341
All I can say if people are

136
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,243
anywhere near this nice on the

137
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:58,244
rest of this trip,
it's going to be okay.

138
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:06,552
Lima, city of kings, home to
a third of Peru's people.

139
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,933
Locals escape by hanging
out at the beach.

140
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,568
Why not, when you can maybe get

141
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,937
a tattoo while you're at it.

142
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:23,310
Is that sanitary?

143
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,120
You've been here before.

144
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,922
Oh, yeah, man.

145
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,124
I take Eric's suggestion and

146
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,194
we head over to see chef Wang,

147
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,631
the uniquely nonconformist

148
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:47,967
seafood specialist, famous
for his incredible and

149
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:52,304
uncompromising food and
his flaming wok.

150
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,875
If Peru has a national
dish, it's probably this.

151
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,578
The fresh estfish only needs the

152
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:04,818
right cut, a little
citrus and no heat.

153
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,491
What's the most common
thing people do wrong?

154
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,093
The quality of the ingredients.

155
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,864
You don't do it with
something that is not fresh.

156
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,132
The cut and the thickness.

157
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:20,400
Right.

158
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:24,236
When you do it, you don't
do it ahead of time.

159
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,472
The whole place is served

160
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,407
whatever men you he's doing that

161
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,709
day, same for everybody.

162
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,310
Today, the flounder he got from

163
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,945
the market is particularly nice,

164
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,381
so that's what we're getting.

165
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,583
Generally thicker pieces to

166
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:40,419
stand up to the
supervises and acids.

167
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,489
Octopus and flounder.

168
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,457
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

169
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,193
It's damn good.

170
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:49,095
It is good.

171
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,698
Is this spicy or not?

172
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:55,935
You ever been spanked in
your life and enjoyed it?

173
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:56,837
Me neither.

174
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:58,004
I don't like pain.

175
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,972
As painful as the pepper.

176
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,574
Brutalized with a pepper.

177
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,175
That's really hot.

178
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,178
It's flounder dressed with

179
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:14,153
pecan, lime, limo and sesame
oil, clearly Eric likes.

180
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:18,625
So you're not like foraging
in the Catskills for your

181
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:18,926
inspiration?

182
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:26,866
You basically rip your ideas
off small businessmen?

183
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:34,867
It's okay?

184
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,175
Circumstance.

185
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,045
Superb.

186
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,514
Chinese and Japanese immigrants
came to Peru in great

187
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,151
numbers in the 19th and 20th

188
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,619
centuries as contract laborers

189
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,387
and farmers and their influence

190
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,822
is felt here, particular there

191
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,660
in food, to a greater degree
than anywhere else on the

192
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:54,227
continent.

193
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:55,762
It's that influence and the

194
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,597
ingredients of Amazonia and

195
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,132
Andes that really distinguishes

196
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,768
the food here as
something special.

197
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,405
What is this?

198
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:10,877
Tofu?

199
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,544
This is not traditional.

200
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,013
It looks Asian to me.

201
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:19,185
I believe it's probably
his name is want.

202
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:23,355
Unless he's a retired porn

203
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,926
star... this shouldn't
be good but it is.

204
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,361
Working up a sweat on that one.

205
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,564
Might have a couple
more beers after this.

206
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:37,604
Have a nice nap, midday nap.

207
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:50,950
One more day in Lima, the

208
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,285
chance to delve a bit further

209
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,854
into the cuisine before things

210
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,489
get a little more old school.

211
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:04,831
A special one we prefer here.

212
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,767
Colentro?

213
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:14,974
It's like cilantro and much
more powerful in flavor.

214
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,776
It would be wrong to point

215
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:21,113
out it is at the
forefront of create I

216
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,148
creating flavor unique to the

217
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,751
Andes and Amazon, flavors you

218
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,719
find no place else on earth.

219
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,154
There seems to be a lot of

220
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,589
interest in the last decade to

221
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,691
the Amazon because of its

222
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,762
amazing spectra entirely new to

223
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:38,130
most of us of ingredients.

224
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,766
At the cutting edge of exactly

225
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:43,569
that territory, his restaurant

226
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,538
Amaz explores the rivers and

227
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,142
landscape of Peru highlighting a

228
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
range of products stunning in

229
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:54,280
their diversity and
to us, their newness.

230
00:11:54,281 --> 00:12:01,921
You have tuna, plantain vinegar.

231
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:06,725
The nut is a fruit in Brazil.

232
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,360
Hmm.

233
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:13,099
We make these scallops
with wild almond.

234
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,435
It is very very soft, the
flavor of it and complements

235
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,037
very well.

236
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:23,876
This one is fresh water shrimp.

237
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,145
Whole new flavor
spectrum, all new.

238
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:29,415
Almost like you need a new
section of your tongue.

239
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,885
It must be exciting Ba
because they're an amazing

240
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,320
garden with the Amazon.

241
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,354
That looks good.

242
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:41,560
This is a soup made of ham
and peanuts and corn.

243
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,694
Hmm.

244
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,530
I like the food.

245
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:48,434
I've enjoyed these
cocktails, to too.

246
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,269
We're going to be wasted.

247
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,470
We'll be fine.

248
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:54,173
Oh, whoa.

249
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,043
This is also tradition.

250
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:00,346
They seasons the fish, put
it on a Leif and cook it.

251
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,848
The fish is catfish.

252
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:06,152
In the Amazon we have like
200 types of catfish.

253
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,688
And the flavor from
the Leif, too.

254
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,891
Here, we have the second

255
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,592
biggest fresh water
fish in the world.

256
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,095
Underneath you have a puree that

257
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:24,096
is a Pam fruit and a
production of fermented yuka.

258
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,438
Fermented.

259
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,274
Or poisonous.

260
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,676
And it becomes...
You can eat it.

261
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,444
These fish are unbelievable.

262
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,246
They get up to 600 pounds

263
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,316
swimming in water no
deeper than a rice paddy.

264
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:37,985
Really?

265
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:39,051
Giant.

266
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,619
They're like dinosaur fish.

267
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,021
Everyone has been saying for

268
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:45,291
years Peru will be
the next big thing.

269
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,126
It is.

270
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:47,426
This really prove it.

271
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:54,266
We offer a chi chili pepper

272
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,136
with under the circumstances
nuts and ants.

273
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:57,637
They're big.

274
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,571
Huge ants.

275
00:13:58,572 --> 00:13:59,738
You want to try it?

276
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,473
Yeah.

277
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,610
Totally.

278
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,212
You're not loving that, are you?

279
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,415
No.

280
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,816
Imagine, you took a lot of

281
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,985
acid and then you ate that whole

282
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,487
bowl of ants and you go home and

283
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,056
you experience violent diarrhea,

284
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,525
you're tripping, it's like 4:00

285
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,927
in the morning and you turn

286
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,028
around and look at the toilet

287
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,897
and all these ant heads
floating around in there.

288
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,466
It would be cool.

289
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,336
It would be cooler
only I can't wait.

290
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,571
Now that we've confirmed what

291
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,740
the we already knew, that Peru's

292
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,509
food is unequivocally awesome,

293
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,645
it seems proper we take a trip

294
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,647
back in time to meet the

295
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:46,618
forebearer's of this country's
rich cultural legacy.

296
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,655
The museum in Lima has a massive

297
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:53,725
collection of
pre-Colombian artifacts.

298
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,627
Looking at them, you get an idea

299
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,030
of what these ancient peoples

300
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:04,136
were like, how they lived.

301
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:04,871
Wow!

302
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:08,941
This is like the real stuff.

303
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,576
I think so.

304
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,244
The real deal, yeah.

305
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,879
Gold necklaces.

306
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,815
You see where the Spanish just

307
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,550
freaked-out when they came here,

308
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,120
turned into men Ni
call greed heads.

309
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:24,723
History does not have
to be boring.

310
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,058
It can be sexy.

311
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,293
I don't know whether you knew

312
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,862
this, I have an aficionado of

313
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,133
early erotica of post Colombian

314
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,602
heiress, you know pottery
of people doing it.

315
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,404
I should have known that.

316
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,006
Turns out things can get

317
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,540
pretty interesting
back in the day.

318
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,509
Oh, yeah.

319
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,476
Those guys can get crazy and get

320
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,379
wild and apparently very kinky.

321
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,381
The erotic gallery.

322
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,449
There you go.

323
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,783
That's a conversation starter.

324
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:57,156
I take Eric to the
pre-Colombian boning section,

325
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:00,259
actually the erotic
pottery section.

326
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,493
Slip of the tongue.

327
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,594
Amazing.

328
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,630
Which sounds about as much

329
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,467
fun as an all nude renaissance

330
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,269
fair, actually pretty crude.

331
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,272
Nothing new under the sun these

332
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,474
pre-Colombian horn dogs
didn't think of first.

333
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,376
A chicken.

334
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:19,211
I'm not sure I
understand this one.

335
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:27,212
I think we frown on
that these days.

336
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,558
Wow, they're doing
it under a blanket.

337
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,293
This must be after the Spanish

338
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:42,294
arrived to teach them shame.

339
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,770
Ew, skeletons with boners.

340
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,172
They are zombies.

341
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:51,610
Getting zombie old-fashioned.

342
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:56,315
I really appreciate your
knowledge.

343
00:16:56,316 --> 00:17:00,219
Was this decorative
or really porn?

344
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,388
I think they put ain't
closet somewhere.

345
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,556
I bet this was right
on the table.

346
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:07,259
Come on in, have a cup of tea.

347
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,894
Sit down.

348
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:09,429
Oh.

349
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,364
Here's some animal
and manual action.

350
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,266
Pretty awesome.

351
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:14,366
Yeah.

352
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,837
This is interesting.

353
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:19,506
Yeah.

354
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,907
I'm happy we made it here, Tony.

355
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:27,580
That was an enlightened moment.

356
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,465
Something about steamy xxx

357
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:50,336
pre-Colombian erotica
always makes me hungry.

358
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:53,405
Luckily at night, Lima comes
alive with the smell and

359
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,675
familiar enticing sound
of sizzling meat.

360
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:02,481
It's time for delicious
screamingly hot garlicky spicy

361
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,082
flavor Jack street meats.

362
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:12,083
As any knows me is well
aware I love me some.

363
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,227
Really?

364
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:15,828
Why?

365
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,296
The neighbors complain?

366
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,897
Complain.

367
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,199
They brought us to this

368
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,067
place, a street stall named for

369
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:28,140
the lady who runs the joint.

370
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:32,811
They specialize in one thing.

371
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:36,081
It is catch you want

Where does it come from?

410
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,431
Columbus was the first European

411
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:37,569
to encounter cocoa beans
off the coast of Honduras.

412
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,371
He's said to have grabbed both

413
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,673
crew and cargo and brought
them back to Spain.

414
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:49,674
A few decades later a Spanish

415
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,921
conquistador was said to have

416
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,324
found the drink of the gods and

417
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,791
the European royalty did their

418
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:03,395

becoming a craze for hot

its way to America.

they call santarias.

To my crew, I say good luck.

557
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,016
We're headed for what looks like

bar on the other side.

559
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:19,124
Let me tell you,
it's quite a ride.

560
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:22,361
I'll go the last.

Water inside the boat.

562

The boat is sinking.

563
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:51,356
You got to go down and
then up, just right!

564
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:58,830
If we make it to the other
side, reasonably dry.

Beer?

566
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,674
The canyon is home to a wide

567

range of species including
and strange us to the cacao

previously thought to
be almost extinct.

569
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,653
A few years ago the trees were

570
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:28,693
tested at a DNA lab and had the

571
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:35,700
rare estforms of cacao in
the world, this stuff.

572
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:39,537
Don is our cacao connection, a

573
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,306
farmer whose family has been

574
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:44,175
working these mountains
over 40 years.

575
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,277
They're absolutely beautiful
when they start out.

00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,579
Really cookie looking pods

when they come off the tree.

578
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,649
They sort of look like someone

579
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,751
glued them to the
side of a tree.

580
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,586
This is a once a year crop?

581
00:30:55,587 --> 00:31:00,458
It grows continuously but
this is a peak seasons.

582
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:01,260
Try that.

583
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:02,961

Where does chocolate come from?

The bean.

587
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,673
Okay.

588
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:16,041
Here's where chocolate
comes from.

589
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,643
The trees produce pods.

590
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:21,812
You split open the pods
and take out the beans.

591
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:25,350
The buyer sun drys the
beans, then roasts them.

592
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,452
After roasting, the beans are

593
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:28,987
extracted from their shells and

594
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,856
ground up, producing
chocolate liqueur.

595
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,492
Mix this concentrate with milk,

596
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,061
sugar, cocoa butter and you get

597
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:40,999
what we call
commercial chocolate.

598
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,101
Our chocolate bar sells for a

599
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:45,971
nosebleed price that's high
by even premium chocolate

600
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:46,238
standards.

601
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,439
Where does the money go?

Most importantly to me and Eric,

603
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,911
are we doing a good thing?

604
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,480
Here's how it breaks down.

605
00:31:55,481 --> 00:32:02,353
The raw cacao costs one chunk.

606

sleeve, this much.

607
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:08,359

Various equipment and
miscellaneous, another small

00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:12,231
chunk.

610
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:15,600
Chris, me and Eric get a
slice out of every bar.

611
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,436
That leaves this much,
which the retailer takes.

612
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,705
Chef bleeding heart hippie here

613
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:22,907

to a local charity.

616
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,615

618
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:34,852
Extremely high quality flavor.

About 40% of the beans from

624
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:50,268
these trees have white
cacao beans mixed in.

625
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,970
The rest are purplish in color.

626
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,173
We heard of an ultra rare group

627
00:32:55,174 --> 00:33:00,711
of trees further up the
mountains that produce pods of

628
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,613

But for now, Don for fun Naoto's

632
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,190

633
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:14,692
traditional Peruvian
mountain meal.

634
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:15,027

boiled chicken inside.

with a cacao sauce.

He was making much more money.

656
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:13,017
And then he didn't plant
soybeans any longer and the

657
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:14,652
coffee production went down so

658
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:15,986

00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,571
Better get right with
the spirit world.

740
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:30,975
Oh, geez.

741
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,010
Shamin juice thrown around,

742
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:36,213
the purified soil and there you

743
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:39,550
go, chocolate magnates.

744
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,151
Well, good luck, dude,
to a good harvest.

745
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,039
The trip downhill
unsurprisingly is a lot easier

746
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,508
on me.

747
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:10,781
Time for me in chef
Repare to get cooking.

748
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,684
Bake to basics, wood fire,

749
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,719
ingredients from the morning

750
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,088
morning and this old
recycling system.

751
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,123
Here, fila.

752
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:21,559
I'm ready for the chicken.

753
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,428
And red wine.

754
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:27,865
Notice how I neatly maneuvered
you into the chef job.

755
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,402
Now we have to maked the
mashed potato and we're good.

756
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:35,139
Eric's mashed potato
secret, around 50% butter.

757
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,306
The glory that is France.

758
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,809
I think they call it gout.

759
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,010
Okay.

760
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:45,316
Let's do it.

761
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,957
Gracias.

762
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,725
You guys can cook.

763
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,662
Some say.

764
00:39:57,663 --> 00:40:03,701
[ Speaking foreign language ]

765
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,836
The only guy, he asked all

766
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,237
the founders of the village here

767
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,339
to do exactly what he has done,

768
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,609
so the farmers are
starting to copy him.

769
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,043
Right.

770
00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:14,812
And he's happy because it's

771
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:18,182
going to bring wealth, in the

772
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:20,885
legend, in the valley
and the community.

773
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:26,491
After Don makes a traditional
unsweetened hot chocolate

774
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:32,329
preparation, ground cakau
anybodies, no sweetener, no

775
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:36,300
nothing, just like the
ancient kings liked it.

776
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:38,536
There we go.

777
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:38,770
Gracias.

778
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,304
The real deal.

779
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:42,272
Only water, and they will use...

780
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,975
Before chocolate hit Europe.

781
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:48,513
This is what the Aztec
kings would drink.

782
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:50,247
They would be jealous right now.

783
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:53,250
You'll get yours eventually.

784
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:54,585
Gracias.

785
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:56,554
Mucho gracias.

786
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:56,788
Salud.

787
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,489
That's good salud.

788
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,625
Salud.

789
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:04,328
Gentlemen, to education.

790
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,664
Yes.

791
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:10,668
So, did we do the right thing?

792
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:12,169
Is it all right for two new

793
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,840
yorkers to make money, however

794
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:17,307
much, or however little, off the

795
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,145
work of struggling farmers
in a faraway Lane?

796
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,614
For the nada, Alberto, Chris,

797
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:24,749
everybody down the line, all the

798
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,383
way to the families who pick the

799
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:28,719
pods off the trees, seem pretty

800
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,220
happy to be doing what they are

801
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,658
doing, but do I want to be
in the chocolate business?

802
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,727
That's something I'm going
to have to figure out.

803
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:39,229
But for now one last thing needs

804
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:44,101
to be done to fulfill our
shamanic obligations.

805
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,369
Guys, you need to get out.

806
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,138
The guy is coming with his
bike, and he doesn't care.

807
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,473
A San Mateo-Hayward bridge, a

808
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:51,676
bundle of uke luptus leaves, a

809
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:59,677
badly working lighter,
got to get right.

810
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:03,988
Do you have a lighter?

811
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:07,124
We need to burn this stuff

812
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:11,028
and pass it around our
bodies three times.

813
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:11,997
Got something.

814
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:12,998
Oh, too moist.

815
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:17,001
Oh, you got it, man.

816
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:17,803
Okay.

817
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:19,503
Smoking.

818
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:20,271
That's smoking.

819
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:24,041
I'm going to get it.

820
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:31,248
Hold on.

821
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,883
Now I've got it.

822
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:33,251
Let's do it.

823
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:38,589
Okay.

824
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,424
That's coming.

825
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:40,625
I got it.

826
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:43,060
We did it.

827
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:43,962
Over.

828
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:47,331
Okay.

829
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:48,899
Done.

830
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,200
Hey.

831
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:50,636
We have a problem with chocolate

832
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:52,203
I'll tell you that.
