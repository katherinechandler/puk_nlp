00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:08,400
We'd talk about it as you
talk about a dead person.

188
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:08,869
Do you remember this?

189
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:09,369
Do you remember that?

190
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,403
Then in February 2011, suddenly

191
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,504
there was resurrection.

192
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,374
The dead came back to life.

193
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:20,346
We meet at a Libyan coffeehouse.

194
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:24,416
A traditional male
only sort of a joint.

195
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,452
Cafe culture is big here.

196
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:30,156
A holdover from the days of
Italian colonization when

197
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:33,860
Mussolini tried to rebuild
Rome's long lost empire.

198
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,896
It's just been the most
amazing experience.

199
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,498
Seeing the rebirth of a
country, of a people.

200
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,834
I mean, last night's fireworks.

201
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,736
There was a general sense of

202
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,404
exuberance bordering on anarchy.

203
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,775
I mean, I felt very
happy there last night.

204
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:51,443
If somewhat in peril.

205
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,611
It's Christmas.

206
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:56,548
It's whatever, it's
the fourth of July.

207
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,384
Rolled into one.

208
00:11:57,385 --> 00:12:00,319
Also there are people who
are trying to stop it.

209
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,122
Those puritans, extremists, if

210
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,191
you want to say militants.

211
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,492
What has happened, people have

212
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,761
come out in defiance of that.

213
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,596
They're showing, we
want to have fun.

214
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,732
For a long time in Libya,
you couldn't have fun.

215
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,802
The biggest misconception is
the place is turning into

216
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:16,936
another Afghanistan and Iraq

217
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,704
where you have bombs
go off, attacks.

218
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,706
But it's not, as you've seen.

219
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,508
Libyans have gone through an

220
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,410
awful time having
fought for freedom.

221
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,812
People have died.

222
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:26,913
People have struggled.

223
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:33,954
And that's going to
hold them together.

224
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:55,707
Kids are selling fireworks
across from the arch.

225
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,344
One is constantly reminded that

226
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,778
Libya was once a vital part of

227
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,281
the ancient Roman empire.

228
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,684
That was nearly 2,000 years ago.

229
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:06,853
Tonight I was told was going to

230
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,555
be an even bigger, Wilder

231
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:13,059
celebration in martyrs square.

232
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,163
But something has happened
since last night.

233
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,931
The British foreign office has

234
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,001
just told all UK citizens
to leave Benghazi.

235
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,435
Libya's second largest city.

236
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:29,675
Due to an unspecified threat.

237
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,177
The Libyan government, such as

238
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:36,515
it is, has denied any basis
for such drastic action.

239
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:41,787
A lone cherry bomb now and
again, an awkward flurry of

240
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,755
Roman candles.

241
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:47,426
The buzz of last night's chaotic

242
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,996
party parched, big time.

243
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,197
Whether or not this is the

244
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,698
larger geopolitical decision,

245
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,233
the vibe toward this western

246
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,969
film crew seems apprehensive.

247
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:04,970
Uncertain.

248
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,116
The following day feels better.

249
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:14,921
Somewhat.

250
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:21,928
Fresh produce is for
sale on Tripoli streets.

251
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,063
If you were a small restaurant,

252
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,731
or shopping for a big family,

253
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,866
you'd bring cash, a wheelbarrow,

254
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,938
and load up on what you need.

255
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:36,175
But the revolution has
brought changed tastes.

256
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,910
Libyans, especially young

257
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:45,911
Libyans, hunger for
more than just freedom.

258
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:51,490
They hunger for
places like this.

259
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,491
Kentucky fried chi

260
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:55,895
chicken.

261
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,165
The colonel, his buddies, the

262
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,399
king and the crown have not made

263
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,669
it here given the uncertainty
of the situation.

264
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,836
In the meantime, places like

265
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:05,871
this have been popping up.

266
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:06,306
Uncle Kentucky.

267
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:13,679
Awesome.

268
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,181
You know where Kentucky is?

269
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,183
Kentucky is from USA.

270
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:17,884
A part.

271
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:18,418
Yeah.

272
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,219
This place is new?

273
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,590
Yeah.

274
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:24,857
It's new.

275
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,226
Before Gaddafi... not possible.

276
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:27,660
Now it's normal.

277
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:32,398
Oh, that's nice.

278
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,799
How you found it?

279
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,469
Spicy, delicious.

280
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,274
Johar, like many Libyans his
age, fought to overthrow

281
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:42,509
Gaddafi.

282
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,709
He was there, gun in hand, when

283
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,380
they stormed Gaddafi's
palace compound.

284
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,781
Happy, excited?

285
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,451
Nice feeling.

286
00:15:52,452 --> 00:16:00,452
Nice feeling that Gaddafi
he killed my cousin.

287
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:07,499
I don't want anyone
to die in war.

288
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,235
He's killed for nothing.

289
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:16,642
The first thing I think
that killing people is bad.

290
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,244
He's leave me do that.

291
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:21,113
Because if I don't kill
him, he kills any.

292
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,148
It's nice to see freedom.

293
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,815
It's nice to see
the bad guy done.

294
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,317
It's nice.

00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,884
I feel welcome here.

00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,253
Finally.

297
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,589
We say no on him.

298
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,458
He's now died.

299
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,661

00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,308
Benghazi that killed the U.S.

372
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:16,609
Ambassador.

373
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,244
All those things are
very real concerns.

374
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,712
But if you only look at what's

375
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,114
on the news, you can miss maybe

376
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:29,821
what's a bigger picture.

377
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:33,592
Another morning in Tripoli
and life goes on.

378
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:36,528
Vendors are out.

379
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:42,668
People go about their
daily routines.

380
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:46,271
This is our traditional
breakfast.

381
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:50,676
What is this dish called?

382
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,711
An overstretched
doughnut, I suppose.

383
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:53,045
Right.

384
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:53,446
With an egg.

385
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:54,546
With an egg on top.

386
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:57,082
What's a little pancake
they put on top?

387
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,216
Just to hold the egg in?

388
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,685
Just to hold the egg in.

389
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,521
It's like a hat to
cover up something.

390
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:03,855
You can get them with cheese,

391
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,792
you can get them with chili

392
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,660
paste, with honey, with sugar.

393
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,496
How do you like yours?

394
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,163
I like mine cooked,
to be honest.

395
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,232
What's the name of
this neighborhood?

396
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,368
This is a cradle
of the revolution.

397
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,336
This was the first
neighborhood to rise up?

398
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:18,971
Yes.

399
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:20,372
This is the first
place to rise up.

400
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:24,810
Why do you think
this neighborhood?

401
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,846
It's been always liked
here by the regime.

402
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:28,947
They made them feel like they're

403
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:32,350
not from this country,
to be honest.

404
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:38,590
Uh-huh.

405
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,492
And we go for it.

406
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,127
Oh, yeah, dip.

407
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:42,995
Right in the egg.

408
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:44,496
Dip it in the egg.

409
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,097
Delicious.

410
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,198
So where were you
when it all started?

411
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,366
I was in London.

412
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,702
Actually, Manchester
at the time.

413
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:50,937
Why?

414
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:53,572
By the 27th, I was in Libya.

415
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:55,707
We went out to see
his house yesterday.

416
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,443
The compound.

417
00:22:56,444 --> 00:22:57,576
I was one of the guys who

418
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:58,877
entered from the Southern gates.

419
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,011
The northern gates.

420
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,314
Akram is in the
security business.

421
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,818
A thriving industry here as
you can probably imagine.

422
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:07,953
A lot of things happened in a

423
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:11,322
lot of different parts of the

424
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,658
country sort of simultaneously.

425
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,093
Kind of amazing all these people

426
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:15,862
came together pretty fast.

427
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:16,995
How did it happen?

428
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:17,864
Ease city.

429
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:18,130
Twitter.

430
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,531
Twitter?

431
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:19,631
It was really like that?

432
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:23,134
Yes.

433
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,135
We sent so much information.

434
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,071
We get a phone call from Tripoli

435
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:30,809
or Benghazi or whatever.

436
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,243
Google earth.

437
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:36,081
We verify that's the location
that needs to be hit.

438
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,348
Then it's gone.

439
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,017
Really?

440
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:39,451
How does that feel knowing you

441
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:44,389
can call in a tomahawk
missile over there?

442
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,558
It's out of the movies.

443
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,294
Did anyone think in their

444
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:52,798
lifetime they'd see the end
of this son of a bitch?

445
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,700
A lot of people said
they never dreamed.

446
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:57,202
I don't know if you call
them hope, dreams, wishes.

447
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,404
It was just something
in the sky.

448
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:00,072
Something I look at every night.

449
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:02,340
When I hit that point and got in

450
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:06,311
and stood on Gaddafi's body,
any dream will come true.

451
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:09,247
What's the situation now?

452
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,816
It's fluid.

453
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,884
It can swing any direction.

454
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,353
Well, look, what happened in

455
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,722
Benghazi a few months ago, I

456
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,724
mean, what does this
mean to the country?

457
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:21,660
I think there is a dark
mysterious hand that doesn't

458
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,529
like this country to prosper.

459
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,130
They see system and organization

460
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:29,034
as a big enemy to them.

461
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,603
These are slowly
getting diminished.

462
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:34,372
A matter of time before
we can get rid of them.

463
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:36,575
How hard is that going to be?

464
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:37,709
Not at all.

465
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,477
We got rid of Gaddafi.

466
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:39,979
Nothing else is hard.

467
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,514
I like your attitude.

468
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,482
The fluid situation in Libya has

469
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,718
been intensifying
since our arrival.

470
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:51,590
We've had to change our
behavior, constantly moving.

471
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,692
Should I be wearing one of these

472
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:56,928
cool journalist safari
jackets at this point?

473
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,764
So it seemed a good
time or maybe not.

474
00:24:58,765 --> 00:24:59,532
Saddle up.

475
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:02,100
To go to Misrata.

476
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,535
Okay, guys.

477
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:03,803
We can go.

478
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:06,271
Roger that.

479
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,974
Since the revolution, Misrata

480
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,942
has been the most secure city in

481
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:11,844
Libya, but over the last two

482
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:15,747
weeks in a hail of bullets and

483
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:19,485
hand-thrown grenade attacks, an

484
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:21,520
imam, security forces and a

485
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:25,591
police officer have
all been killed.

486
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:28,594
I want you to move forward.

487
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:29,195
Come past me.

488
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:32,831
All along the narrow
congested highway, there are

489
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:33,800
checkpoints manned mostly by

490
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,501
local militias, and I want to

491
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,570
stress most of them
are friendly enough.

492
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,972
We are, however, in a hurry to

493
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,508
get to Misrata before dark.

494
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:51,509
Traveling at night around
here is not advised.

495
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,630
Drop the camera.

496
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:05,364
Yep, yep.

497
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:09,801
Stop the camera.

498
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,670
Pulling in a town after dark,

499
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:18,243
it doesn't feel like a happy
place to be right now.

500
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,511
Misrata is where some of the
fiercest and most heroic

501
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,614
struggles of the war occurred.

502
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:23,449
Resistance was the most

503
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,484
determined, and the response by

504
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:31,022
the Gaddafi forces
especially merciless.

505
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,357
We've just learned that earlier

506
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,925
in the day, a city councilman

507
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,227
who was a hero of the revolution

508
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:39,965
was assassinated, and it's not

509
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,067
clear who's responsible.

510
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:45,470
Misrata is on full lockdown.

511
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:48,439
Another checkpoint.

512
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,676
Looking around at the price

513
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:51,843
this city paid for freedom, you

514
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,112
can see why they don't want to

515
00:26:54,113 --> 00:27:00,720
lose what they
fought so hard for.

516
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:15,133
Morning in Misrata?

517
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,902
How is it?

518
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,704
Daylight reveals the extent

519
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:26,705
of the fighting that took
place here not so long ago.

520
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:39,958
This here used to be
a vegetable market.

521
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:43,762
Close, one of Gaddafi's
soldiers here closed.

522
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:45,396
He left him here and ran?

523
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:49,434
That's what they did in Tripoli.

524
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:50,702
Just lose their clothes and run

525
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:52,403
away in the streets
so nobody would know.

526
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,305
This is Hanid, one of the

527
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,242
guys we called the Misrata boys,

528
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:58,443
basically militia members from

529
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,678
the area who looked out for us

530
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:07,318
here and Tripoli when thinks
started getting hinky in

531
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,787
neighboring areas.

532
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,421
Hujab these days is hunting down

533
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,523
former Gaddafi supporters.

534
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,325
So the Gaddafi forces rolled in.

535
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:18,563
They'd use these tanks to
fire... around the city.

536
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:18,865
Around.

537
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:26,866
This was the
operation room here.

538
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:35,706
♪

539
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:48,726
Now if you had any doubt about
the terrible odds these

540
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,295
young revolutionaries were

541
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:49,929
facing during the early days of

542
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:50,629
the fighting, especially in the

543
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,797
months before NATO came in with

544
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:57,735
air support, check out
Misrata's war museum.

545
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,870
What did this fire?

546
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,806
Fired a rocket.

547
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:01,073
Homemade.

548
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:01,707
There's a rocket here.

549
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,909
You had to have some serious

550
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,477
courage to ride around
with this thing.

551
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,646
Why?

552
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:09,248
We trust our people.

553
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,850
There are a lot of
homemade things here.

554
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:12,819
This is homemade, too.

555
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,919
Fires rockets.

556
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,286
This is homemade.

557
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,354
This one.

558
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,656
This was from... yes.

559
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:19,325
We got it.

560
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:22,027
You took it off a helicopter
and you put it on a car?

561
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:22,661
Uh-huh.

562
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:25,931
And you know what this is for?

563
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,498
So it's basically a cross bow

564
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,501
that fires Molotov cocktails.

565
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,602
Try it sometimes.

566
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,973
You're shooting this at
people who have mortars.

567
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,908
And tanks.

568
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:37,176
Tanks.

569
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:37,443
Yeah.

570
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,377
You're shooting this at tanks.

571
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,478
Yeah.

572
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,813
That's what we got at the time.

573
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:42,281
It's what you had.

574
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:45,050
It's awesome.

575
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:51,289
The next president of Libya,

576
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:57,295
the one who's going to be
in charge, this is his.

577
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,230
He has to think twice
before he sits on it.

578
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,898
Never screw your people.

579
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:00,765
Here, this is Gaddafi stuff.

580
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:05,236
This was all taken
from the compound.

581
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,038
That's his chair.

582
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,072
Preferred hair products.

583
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:08,739
His shaving kit.

584
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,242
See he was wearing a mask.

585
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:11,978
Beauty mask.

586
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,979
I could use some of that.

587
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,485
Gaddafi, he's
beautiful, you know.

588
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:23,421
And this is the first.

589
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:23,890
That's the first.

590
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:27,292
Yeah, that's the first one.

591
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:28,493
That's a normal guy that went

592
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,195
out to protest the first rally

593
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,330
and somebody come
in and shoot him.

594
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,832
So next day the whole
city came out.

595
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,567
That's when everything started.

596
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:41,806
These are photos of those
killed during the uprising.

597
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,943
Combatants and bystanders alike.

598
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:50,781
Her name is Muna.

599
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,485
She was 6 days when she died.

600
00:30:54,486 --> 00:31:02,486
Killed in their homes,
tortured to death in prisons,

601
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,131
snipers.

602
00:31:05,132 --> 00:31:13,132
They killed him, with,
like, a grenade.

603
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,611
Yeah.

604
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,412
You know what he was saying?

605
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:26,784
He's saying, what's
going on, guys?

606
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:27,919
Why are you doing that?

607
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:35,920
We still have the T-shirt
with the blood in it.

608
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,009
Do you know any of these people?

609
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,112
Yeah, I know a couple of them.

610
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,680
I knew a couple.

611
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,549
This guy's Egyptian.

612
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,684
Not even his fight.

613
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:02,487
He didn't want to leave.

614
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:07,458
This died in Tripoli.

615
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,127
These are brothers and sister.

616
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:10,095
One, two, three, four.

617
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,197
They died on the same
day, the same house.

618
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:15,633
The mother when we found her,
she was holding the kid.

619
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:16,934
They were both dead and
holding each other.

620
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:24,935
It was a very sad moment.

621
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,850
I don't know if you noticed,

622
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,753
I'm going full blitzer
on this shoot.

623
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:13,924
The Mediterranean sea defines
Libya's northern border.

624
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,526
In shacks built along the coast,

625
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:16,961
people get together on weekends

626
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:18,463
to do what people do everywhere

627
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,298
in the world in one form or

628
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:25,002
another since the
beginnings of society.

629
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:25,904
Like barbecue?

630
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:27,338
Who does not like barbecue?

631
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:31,342
There he is.

632
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,745
They sure like him here.

633
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,247
Chase down on animal.

634
00:33:35,248 --> 00:33:39,684
Kill it.

635
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:44,655
Cycle of life.

636
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,357
Cut it into pieces.

637
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:50,695
And throw it on a flame.

638
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,298
Freedom fighters.

639
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,933
Ex-freedom fighters.

640
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,602
Chilling, having fun,
making barbecue.

641
00:33:57,603 --> 00:34:04,309
To start, they grill a lamb
in small pieces with a few

642
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,576
veggies.

643
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:07,178
A beer.

644
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:13,684
Been a week without any
alcohol of any kind.

645
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,754
I'm enjoying my new
clean living lifestyle.

646
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:17,623
That's hospitality.

647
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:19,190
I said it before.

648
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,525
I'll say it again.

649
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,793
Barbecue may not be the road to

650
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:27,432
world peace, but it's a start.

651
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,433
Awesome food.

652
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:28,700
Yeah.

653
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:33,104
Laid back.

654
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,405
In America, laid back.

655
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,775
A stew made of kidneys, liver

656
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,211
and heart served family style.

657
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:42,980
Feel free to eat with hands.

658
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:48,085
Right hand only, please.

659
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,587
And a really traditional thing

660
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:54,959
left over from the Italians,

661
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,728
basically pasta with ragout.

662
00:34:57,729 --> 00:35:05,729
What's this dish called?

663
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:09,675
It's good.

664
00:35:09,676 --> 00:35:12,610
The Italians left
you one nice thing.

665
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:17,047
A few nice buildings and pasta.

666
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,250
So the story of Misrata, the

667
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,219
story of Libya seems to be

668
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,887
ordinary people suddenly called

669
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,722
upon to do extraordinary things.

670
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:27,192
Where were you when
war broke out?

671
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:30,428
I was in Canada, Montreal.

672
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:31,796
Studying medicine.

673
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:32,063
Yes.

674
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:34,232
The doctor put her medical

675
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,966
studies on hold to help tend all

676
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,235
manner of horrible war injuries.

677
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,069
What kind of procedures were you

678
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,206
doing on a regular basis?

679
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:41,707
Everything.

680
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:46,411
Everything. Without prior
practice and practice and

681
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:48,213
trying to pick up things.

682
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,914
How many patients did
you treat a day?

683
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:53,284
60, 70, like a lot.

684
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:54,085
The whole hospital was full.

685
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:59,790
When you heard he
had been killed?

686
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,025
Relief?

687
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:00,892
Relief.

688
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:02,760
I was like realizing that, okay,

689
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,595
it's over and trying to heal my

690
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:05,763
own wounds because in the middle

691
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,932
of it you just go, go, go, and

692
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:12,036
you never realize how much
injuries and trauma you get

693
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,538
inside yourself.

694
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:14,240
Right.

695
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:15,373
Because before you never

696
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,242
think we're going to survive and

697
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:18,709
we'll have a fry Libya.

698
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,710
Just like going with the state

699
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,346
of mind that I'm going to do my

700
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,147
best and I'm ready in peace with

701
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:27,752
myself if I die, and then
you find yourself here now.

702
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:32,122
It's like... now
it's the gray area.

703
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,691
She risked her life along

704
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:37,495
with the men, but traditional

705
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:40,431
rules of conduct do not allow

706
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,467
her to sit with
them during dinner.

707
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:44,335
She's relegated to what might be

708
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,304
the called the kids' table.

709
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,805
What can one say, we who think

710
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:50,408
of ourselves as more
enlightened in this area?

711
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,277
I don't know.

712
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:57,882
Rightly or wrongly
I said nothing.

713
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,384
What does freedom mean?

714
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:03,921
I don't know that
either, I guess.

715
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,590
For sure it does mean the

716
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:08,893
freedom to enjoy be a afternoon

717
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,861
no one thought possible only a

718
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,663
little while ago, the freedom,

719
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,032
at least, to joke, to laugh, to

720
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:23,033
be for a while
relatively carefree.

721
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:29,615
♪

722
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:01,078
The road to Tripoli, a
healthy supreme court fast.

723
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,680
Oh, liver sandwich.

724
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,515
When they talk about a high-risk

725
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:09,954
environment, I think they
were talking about this.

726
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:17,955
That's good.

727
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,501
Halfway back to Tripoli, the

728
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:31,376
magnificent ruins
of Leftus Magna.

729
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:33,043
Arguably the most intact remains

730
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:41,044
of a Roman city in the world.

731
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:47,525
It's worth noting that the
emperor was himself Libyan.

732
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:48,193
That's pretty amazing.

733
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:56,194
Born right here.

734
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:04,835
Someone chipped
off all the legs.

735
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,012
No that I was looking.

736
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,914
Everyone else in the world is

737
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:12,750
overrun with tourists,
but, look, no one.

738
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:17,655
You're free to
wander as you wish.

739
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:19,490
Quite a backdrop, you know,

740
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:21,759
seeing a little dinner theater

741
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,466
production of "our town" a
couple thousand years ago.

742
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,368
Not bad.

743
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,170
The only other visitors today

744
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:38,142
are a troupe of
Libyan boy scouts.

745
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:41,679
Bizarrely enough, Gaddafi
himself was once a scout and

746
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,980
this is one of the only

747
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,749
organizations allowed to remain

748
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,150
independent of the government.

749
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,852
Maybe I ought to go down there

750
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,855
and introduce myself,
exchange some boy scout lore.

751
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:56,427
Yes, yes, I was once
a boy scout, too.

752
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:56,895
Hello.

753
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:58,463
Drilled into their heads is

754
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,535
something that was long
ago drilled into mine.

755
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:07,905
I promise to be trustworthy,
loyal, helpful, friendly,

756
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:14,211
courteous, kind, obedient,
thrifty, brave, clean and

757
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:20,185
reverent.

758
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,154
You know, it's been a really

759
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,056
difficult shoot for a
whole lot of reasons.

760
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:07,057
It's not easy to shoot here.

761
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,133
But in spite of all of that, for

762
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:14,572
me this was a happy show.

763
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:15,306
It's Libya.

764
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,507
It was supposed to be the bad

765
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:21,011
guys, a bad country filled
with bad people, right?

766
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,647
I don't think so.

767
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:27,051
I met a lot of really
nice people here.

768
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:30,220
Nobody is saying we're going
to be perfect tomorrow.

769
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,056
Everybody seems to be saying,

770
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:37,728
you know, look at
us in five years.

771
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:40,698
Today that's a pretty
reasonable attitude.

772
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,366
This is a place that's filled a

773
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,201
lot of extraordinary people who

774
00:41:43,202 --> 00:41:45,435
have done an extraordinary thing

775
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:50,808
on very short notice under very

776
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,310
difficult circumstances and at a

777
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,579
very difficult time who are

778
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,346
continuing to do the best they

779
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,316
can, and I wish them well.
