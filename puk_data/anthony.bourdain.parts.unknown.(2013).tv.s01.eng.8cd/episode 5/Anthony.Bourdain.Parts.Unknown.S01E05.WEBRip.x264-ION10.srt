far away as possible from
the place that I was born.

3
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,242
Far both geographically
and spiritually.

4
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:50,243
To leave it behind.

12
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:41,834
Tangier, it's Morocco.

13
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,936
But from 1923 through 1956, it

14
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,971
was loosely governed by the

15
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:48,475
major powers, an
international zone.

16
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:51,378
For years it seemed
everything was permitted.

17
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,914
Nothing was forbidden.

18
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,551
At the northern tip of Africa, a

19
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:06,552
short ferry hop from Spain,
Tangier was a magnet for

20
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,596
writers, remittance men,
spies, and artists.

21
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:10,564
If you were a bad boy of your

22
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:11,565
time, you liked drugs, the kind

23
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,699
of sex that was frowned upon at

24
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,235
home and an affordable lifestyle
set against an exotic

25
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:23,236
background, Tangier was for you.

26
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,849
Matisse, Genest,
William Burroughs.

27
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,883
Many have come this way, staying

28
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,020
a while or hanging around.

29
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,190
But no one stayed longer or

30
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,658
became more associated with

31
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,929
Tangier than the novelist
and composer Paul Bowles.

32
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,031
In works like "the sheltering

33
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,499
sky" he created a romantic

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,337
vision of Tangier that persists

35
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,671
even today, a dream that's

36
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:56,376
become almost inseparable in the

37
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:58,945
minds of many from reality.

38
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:03,616
I'm here to find
that dream city.

39
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:09,423
The place Burroughs
referred to as "Interzone."

40
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:18,658
♪

41
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,909
Tangier, like I said, was a city

42
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,011
of ex-pats... people with pasts,

43
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,012
people who simply didn't like

44
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,114
where they were and craved

45
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:38,751
somewhere and something else.

46
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,387
The grand socco is the gateway

47
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,522
to the Medina where you could

48
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:49,662
find the Casbah, which
means fortress by the way.

49
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,731
The port is to the east, and

50
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,765
right in the middle of it all,

51
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,302
the petit socco, called the last

52
00:03:55,303 --> 00:04:01,774
stop, the meeting place, the
switchboard of Tangier.

53
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,810
Reasons for settling in Tangier

54
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:08,481
diverge, but everyone sooner or

55
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,582
later since the beginning of

56
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,684
memory comes to cafe Tingis.

57
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,685
Jonathan Dawson came to this

58
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:16,789
city over 20 years ago as a

59
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,425
journalist, and he never left.

60
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,427
He lives a life not too distant

61
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,563
from Burroughs' fantasy.

62
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,097
Cake and tea at 4:00 every day

63
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,734
served by his man servant.

64
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:33,440
He may not have a gazelle,
but a pet rooster will do.

65
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:36,142
And every day he makes the

66
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,677
rounds of the cafes, seeing all

67
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:44,016
the old faces, ending up
sooner or later here.

68
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,017
This is the petit socco?

69
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,619
This is the petit socco.

70
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,755
Yes.

71
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,257
It existed in venetian times,

72
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,426
existed in Roman times, in the

73
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,895
Portuguese times and the English

74
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:56,963
were here for 22 years and then

75
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,099
the international city
until 1956, now here.

76
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,270
This is a very historic
scare, very historic.

77
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,872
As a writer, I've noticed

78
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,840
everybody who comes here to do

79
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,976
an article does
the same article.

80
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,011
It is so damn boring.

81
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,580
They're all the beat generation

82
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:14,647
and there are lots of other

83
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,682
stories in Morocco apart from

84
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:18,785
that, but everyone
likes the beats.

85
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,388
Bill Burroughs, Tennessee

86
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,490
Williams, they were all here,

87
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,158
but that's a small part
of the Moroccan history.

88
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,193
That's a 15-year page.

89
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,295
There was a life before
that and a life after that.

90
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,329
You're here.

91
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,864
Yeah.

92
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,900
It was inevitable.

93
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,035
Let's pretend those
guys never came.

94
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,606
What is this place?

95
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,274
The reality is, you can
read the story and live it.

96
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:42,910
People do come here and try to

97
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:45,878
live it, but they
don't stay very long.

98
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,946
They smoke a little dope, go to

99
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,015
a cheap hotel and go
home with bedbugs.

100
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,049
And a great story.

101
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,083
And a great story.

102
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,219
The attitude here is different
than other parts of

103
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,754
Morocco.

104
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,457
I think they have a higher

105
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,560
tolerance of tradition of
bad or outrageous behavior.

106
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:05,231
They have a high tolerance
of mad people, you know?

107
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:11,971
But Moroccans essentially
are very tolerant people.

108
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,039
They quite like madness as well.

109
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,074
They kind of celebrate
that a bit.

110
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:15,609
You know?

111
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,577
How Moroccan is Tangier?

112
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:18,745
It's a Moroccan city
with a European outlook.

113
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,747
You can stand up on the
boulevard and see Spain and

114
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,281
Gibraltar and see all sorts of

115
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,418
people passing through, but
it is a Moroccan city.

116
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:29,088
I'm 62 years old.

117
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,623
I didn't know international days

118
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,692
which finished in 1956, but at

119
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:33,760
that time, I think Europeans may

120
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,828
have outnumbered Moroccans
in the center of this city.

121
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,430
It's not the case now.

122
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,431
There's very few Europeans

123
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,734
actually living here full time.

124
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,270
The notion of living a life

125
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,906
apart, of being somewhere else,

126
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,509
there are those who
like that feeling.

127
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,612
I like that feeling.

128
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,646
Then there are those who may

129
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,647
live apart, may live somewhere

130
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:59,819
else, but they're not
entirely comfortable.

131
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,387
It's the difference annoys
them or is a burden.

132
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,990
It did, and it frustrates them.

133
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:07,594
Some people have to leave
home to find their home.

134
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,161
I'm one of those people.

135
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:15,401
Whereas I didn't feel at home in

136
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,435
the country I was born in at

137
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,470
all, but here I feel okay.

138
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,071
I feel very, very happy here.

139
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:24,243
There is indeed something
special about this place.

140
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,345
Burroughs described the native

141
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,981
quarter of Tangier as a maze of

142
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:34,821
sunless twisting streets
filled with blind alleys.

143
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,288
Its smell was particularly

144
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,926
notable to him, including a mix

145
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:44,163
of hashish, seared
meat, and sewage.

146
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,766
Tangier, before anything else,

147
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,368
is essentially a port city,
with all the things that

148
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:54,507
traditionally come
with port cities.

149
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,542
It's situated at the choke point

150
00:07:55,543 --> 00:08:00,212
between the Atlantic ocean
and the Mediterranean sea.

151
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,315
The Moroccan coast is a rich

152
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,350
fishing ground, and a lot of

153
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,486
people make their
living from the sea.

154
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,089
Onshore they use a method called

155
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,123
sentul fishing, where weighted

156
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:15,294
nets basically drag fish
across the bottom of the sea.

157
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,630
Some of that fish, the good

158
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:21,934
stuff anyway, ends up here.

159
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,936
The saveur de Poisson, or

160
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,138
restaurant populare or Popeye's.

161
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,174
The place has a lot of names,

162
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,776
but locals and ex-pats alike who

163
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:30,843
have been coming here for years

164
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:35,915
say it has some of the
best tagine in town.

165
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,249
Mohammed, the owner and head

166
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,919
chef, is from the nearby rif

167
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,020
mountains, and he sources a lot

168
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,488
of his stuff, his produce and

169
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:46,793
his Greens, from there, and
he's real proud of them.

170
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,327
The back room is dedicated to

171
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,396
sorting and drying various herbs

172
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,397
which he blends into a secret

173
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:56,135
mix that he claims has all
sorts of healthful and

174
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,304
boner-inspiring benefits.

175
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,405
If every dish I have been told

176
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,441
over the years would make me

177
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,475
strong worked, I would have a

178
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,177
permanent pup tent going on

179
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,513
down there, so I take all
that with a grain of salt.

180
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:11,283
Hi.

181
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,586
Hello.

182
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,688
His son Hassan
delivers the food.

183
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:19,558
It all starts with fresh olives,

184
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,559
they're in season now.

185
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,729
And roasted wall nuts.

186
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,263
Some warm, very good bread.

187
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,398
Squishy.

188
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,900
And you get this stuff.

189
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,603
Everybody gets it.

190
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:33,105
A pulpy puree of figs, raisins,

191
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,575
strawberries and full of
Mohammed's potent herbs and

192
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,746
spices, of course.

193
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,314
All night, 24 clock.

194
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,449
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

195
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,917
It's supposed to
make me more manly.

196
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:45,985
You know what?

197
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,720
I'm eating.

198
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,657
Let's not talk about
that, okay, sunshine?

199
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:53,826
What is a tagine, anyway?

200
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:57,229
It's a traditional Moroccan stew

201
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,833
that can include
vegetables, meat, or ship.

202
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:05,938
Tonight, baby shark, calamari
and monk fish with fresh

203
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,943
mountain shin spinach cooked in

204
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:15,414
a classic Clay pot that
gives it its name.

205
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,016
The domed top is supposed to

206
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:16,884
force the condensation back in

207
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:18,450
to the dish and keep
it moist and tender.

208
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:18,986
That's delicious.

209
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:20,019
I think it's the Greens and the

210
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,054
aromatics and the herbs, I
have no idea what they are.

211
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,055
Never had anything like it.

212
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,692
Tangier version
of farm to table.

213
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:26,193
Hi.

214
00:10:26,194 --> 00:10:28,795
Wow.

215
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:29,829
When's that?

216
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:35,301
Thank you.

217
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,971
And a whole turbot, brushed with

218
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,573
olive oil, salt, and pepper and

219
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:47,279
some coriander, then grilled
perfectly over the coals.

220
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,348
Cuddled up next to the
fish, tiny shark kabobs.

221
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,416
Cute.

222
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,450
Wow, spectacular.

223
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,119
Good value.

224
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,921
All of this for 20 bucks?

225
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,155
Pretty good job on Mr. Fish.

226
00:10:56,156 --> 00:11:00,793
That will teach you.

227
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:08,794
[ Speaking foreign language ]

228
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:13,806
He's freaking me out.

229
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:14,841
It's like that guy with, you

230
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:19,511
know, you're tripping
and does this to you?

231
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,148
For dessert, strawberries,
pine nuts and honey.

232
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,150
Like the whole meal, it's
eccentric and delicious.

233
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,184
Thank you.

234
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:31,958
You're welcome.

235
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:38,330
I haven't had so much fruits
and nuts since Altaban.

236
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:43,736
I told Mick, I said, Mick,
this is a bad crowd.

237
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:49,041
But he's like, man, we
can't disappoint the fans.

238
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,611
Ah, memories.

239
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:09,962
In Tangier, I lived in one
room in the native quarter.

240
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,064
I have not taken a bath in a

241
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,735
year nor changed my clothes or

242
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,770
removed them except to stick a

243
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,940
needle every hour in the fibrous

244
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,675
gray wooden flesh of
termal addiction.

245
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:28,614
I never cleaned or
dusted the room.

246
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:34,586
Amputee everyone pul boampule

247
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,857
objections and garbage
piled up to the ceiling.

248
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,458
Light and water long since
turned off for nonpayment.

249
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:40,427
I did absolutely nothing.

250
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:42,494
I could look at the end of
my shoe for eight hours.

251
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,562
I was only roused to action when

252
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:51,103
the hourglass of junk ran out."

253
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,672
The words of William Seward

254
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,308
Burroughs, one of my heroes.

255
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,911
He came to Tangier in 1953,

256
00:12:58,912 --> 00:12:59,946
shortly after shooting his wife

257
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,082
to death in a drunken
accident in Mexico City.

258
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:08,320
He was a heroin addict, a

259
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,355
homosexual, and an inspiration

260
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:17,356
to those protohipsters who
became known as the beats.

261
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:25,404
Burroughs, however,
was not a beat Nick.

262
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,438
He was a somewhat stuffy,

263
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,074
well-dressed St. Louis son of a

264
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,041
good family gone wrong.

265
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,108
He was also to my mind the

266
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,576
greatest writer of the
whole damn bunch.

267
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,544
On the road, you can have it.

268
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:36,448
His classic "naked
lunch" was written here.

269
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,551
A nonlinear, dark, dry humored

270
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,619
searingly critical and satirical

271
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,256
and profane masterpiece.

272
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,894
Burroughs was apparently high

273
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,761
for much of the process on

274
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:57,762
heroin or locally available
prescription opiate.

275
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,606
And the daily staple in
many of these parts.

276
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,740
Hashish, keef and maldune.

277
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,775
Hashish is the concentrated THC

278
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,211
resin of the cannabis plant as

279
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,046
well as varying amounts of its

280
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:07,847
flowers and leaves that have

281
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,381
been separated from the buds and

282
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:14,320
compressed into sheet
or brick-like form.

283
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,821
Keif is the part of the plant

284
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,389
containing only the strongest

285
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,027
concentration of
psychoactive ingredients.

286
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,094
Majune is a confection made from

287
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:28,267
keef, fruits, nuts,
chocolate and honey.

288
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,369
I was, of course, fascinated by

289
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,472
this product since reading about

290
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,506
it and inquired of some local

291
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,743
contacts who shall
necessarily go unnamed.

292
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,745
How was it made?

293
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,415
This is what I wanted to know.

294
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:49,621
They were kind enough
to demonstrate.

295
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,690
Keef is first chopped into fine

296
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,292
granules and slowly added to

297
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,962
melted butter and chocolate
over a low heat.

298
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,296
You toast it and release the

299
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:01,600
psychotropic goodies within.

300
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:05,471
While the binder element is slow

301
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:08,174
cooking in the pan, a
combination of spices are

302
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,042
blended with ka shoes, almonds,

303
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,744
walnuts, and dried fruit.

304
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,812
This will be the framework to

305
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:17,950
suspend the THC-laden
goodness in the next step.

306
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,086
The cannabis-laced butter

307
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,087
chocolate is added along with

308
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:25,924
plenty of honey to bind
together all the ingredients.

309
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:33,925
Then mix.

310
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,271
Last, you roll the entirety of

311
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,407
the mixture into a ball and

312
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:48,147
either refrigerate
or dig right in.

313
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,216
Of course, network standards and

314
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,817
practices prohibit me from even

315
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,385
tasting this delicious and

316
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,920
reportedly mind-altering treat.

317
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,024
I'm guessing, anyway.

318
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,126
So until I see Chris, John and

319
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,227
wolf doing bong riffs in "the

320
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,761
situation room," I will, of

321
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,330
course, abide by these rules

322
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:09,001
because that's the
kind of guy I am.

323
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,037
There's one particular cafe in

324
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,104
the heart of the Kasbah that's

325
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,639
drawn in foreign dignitaries,

326
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,242
rock stars, aristocrats and

327
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:20,846
artists since it opened
its doors in 1943.

328
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:26,052
Cafe Baba.

329
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:31,257
Sweet mint tea in a thick
slow-moving haze of smoke.

330
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,859
It smells like my
dorm room 1972.

331
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,462
Good evening, hello.

332
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:41,667
This is George Bajalia and

333
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,235
Zeneb, and I should say right

334
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,803
now that I have no direct

335
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:48,407
knowledge of either George or

336
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,876
Zaneb smoking any illegal

337
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:54,413
substances nor do I have at the

338
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,282
recollection of me doing
anything untoward in their

339
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:59,051
presence because that would
be, like, wrong, dude.

340
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:03,422
George is here on a Fulbright

341
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,857
scholarship and
Zaneb is an artist.

342
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,726
Others in the room, however,
well, don't give me that

343
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,727
innocent look, you young punks.

344
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,297
I know somebody in here
is smoking reefer.

345
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:12,798
How stoned are people here?

346
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,934
We can ask, just ask.

347
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:19,037
You're not getting
totally ripped here?

348
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,639
No.

349
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,241
It's a functional
part of daily life.

350
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,809
For a long time, the rest of the

351
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,945
country and the government

352
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,480
didn't really like
Tangier a whole lot.

353
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,548
It was seedy.

354
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,184
There were foreigners
who came here and...

355
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,185
It makes money.

356
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,786
He sees it as a future
economic super power as I

357
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,324
understand it.

358
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,592
He's talk uging condos,
boutique hotels.

359
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,561
That is good for bad?

360
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,664
For Moroccans, it's work, but

361
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,233
of course ex-pats want to keep

362
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,868
Tangier like they
know it before.

363
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,370
I mean, this cafe is very

364
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:52,371

00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,321
For years, if you were a rock

551
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:34,459
god, you had to come here, dig

552
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,027
the crazy percussion, strings,

553
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,129
and pipes that took
you to another place.

554
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:43,835
It's intricate,
hypnotic, beautiful.

555
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:46,939
If you're in the right frame
of mind, mesmerizing.

556
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,484
Anyone who comes to Tangier

557
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:03,689
inevitably ends up lost in
the old part of the city.

558
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,257
The Medina is just what
you want it to be.

559
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,359
The ancient world residing just

560
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,666
next to and around the new one.

561
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,735
You can walk around inside the

562
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:21,807
movie in your head, play the

563
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,710
bogey character you never were,

564
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:25,744
all against an all too willing,

565
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:26,778
all too genuine backdrop.

566
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,246
Ordinarily just about the last

567
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,382
thing in the world I would
be interested in doing is

568
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,918
antiquing, but buried in the

569
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:40,919
network of twisting narrow
streets of the old city is

570
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,434
boutique Majid
owned by this man.

571
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,970
And he's one interesting guy.

572
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,004
Thank you.

573
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,039
Come in.

574
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,673
When he was a little kid back

575
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,607
in the '60s, Majid left his

576
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:57,175
hometown of fez and came here

577
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,244
where he would earn money
emptying ashtrays at wild

578
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:03,715
parties being thrown
here by wealthy ex-pats.

579
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:05,483
He saw what these people would

580
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:06,617
buy for themselves and how they

581
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,719
would decorate their homes, and

582
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,588
he started to look around for

583
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:15,293
himself, scoring, then
reselling art and antiques.

584
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,294
Wow.

585
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:22,968
It became something
of an obsession.

586
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:26,604
Now his artifacts from Morocco

587
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:27,239
and north Africa are bought by

588
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,174
collectors all over the world.

589
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:29,207
Jewelry and old doors.

590
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,309
Wow, these are
incredibly beautiful.

591
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:35,981
Tell me about that.

592
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:39,084
Amber, coral, shells.

593
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:39,651
These used to be currency.

594
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:41,219
These shells.

595
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,254
How old is this?

596
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,489
Early '20s.

597
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,391
The Amber is millions
of years old.

598
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,527
How much are you selling it for?

599
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:51,096
By weight.

600
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:56,267
Quite heavy piece
this one, 429 grams.

601
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,369
So it comes like 42,000
so that's how much in

602
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,404
dollars?

603
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:03,041
Almost $5,000.

604
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:03,542
About $5,000.

605
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:04,543
Almost.

606
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:06,077
Should we look at another floor?

607
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:11,316
Oh, yes, follow me.

608
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:17,288
There's a nice collection
of things from the Sahara.

609
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,323
So you travel a lot?

610
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:21,459
Not like you.

611
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,096
Oh, this is for pounding...
Yes, this is from the Gon

612
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,131
tribe.

613
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,232
From Mali.

614
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,766
How much will this
sell for do you think?

615
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,835
Around $300.

616
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:30,836
Really?

617
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:32,971
For this?

618
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:35,540
That's very reasonable.

619
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,574
I'll be buying that.

620
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,676
That's going to
be an old friend.

621
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:39,710
Also memory.

622
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:44,415
Also memory of Tangier as well.

623
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:49,787
Majid suggests lunch at
Andalus, a locals only place

624
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:54,692
nearby.

625
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:55,760
As a Moroccan, so many people

626
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:56,794
come with a romantic notion of a

627
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,363
Tangier they read
about in books.

628
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:01,432
Do people have a
realistic expectation?

629
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,901
Are they looking for Morocco or

630
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:07,338
are they looking
for this phantasm?

631
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,373
It is a phantasm.

632
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:09,440
It is.

633
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,441
When you get here, you know

634
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,576
Morocco, you feel that you are

635
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,644
in Morocco but you are not.

636
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,314
There's a lot of Mediterranean
attached to this town.

637
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,815
Also the history, people hear

638
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,985
story about Tangier that it

639
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,987
was... when I first came in the

640
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:24,655
'60s, everybody said
that you came late.

641
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,192
Right.

642
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:29,260
Now I'm saying the same
thing as the young now.

643
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,761
They come and they
saw wow, I say...

644
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:34,432
What was better
about those days?

645
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,001
Well, for me at that time I

646
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:39,137
was young, and it was the boom

647
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:42,240
of hippies, and it
was a destination.

648
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,842
You know, cafe Baba, meet Bob

649
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,445
Dylan, and the parties
was going on.

650
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:50,048
I miss these kind of parties.

651
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,616
People fly from everywhere to

652
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:55,786
the party, and they make
the whole town move.

653
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,356
Blue and white party, white and

654
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,559
gold party, hat party,
you know, it's amazing.

655
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,695
You see people coming in with

656
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,664
amazing hats, like a cage with a

657
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:09,400
bird, extravagant
hats, you know.

658
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,036
They put so much energy and time

659
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:11,970
into the parties, you know?

660
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:19,710
Look at... now, that looks good.

661
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,346
Tomatoes brushed with local

662
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:24,983
olive oil, garlic and coriander.

663
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,051
Liver kabobs, beef liver to be

664
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:29,154
exact, grilled over charcoal.

665
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:31,222
That looks very nice.

666
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,959
For fish, a bit of swordfish and

667
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,828
and some orange roughy.

668
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,397
That is just beautiful.

669
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,966
How do you like the tomato?

670
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:45,203
The swordfish is amazing.

671
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:46,204
So how else have things changed?

672
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:48,773
You saw how many tourists
there was today?

673
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,875
They were in a hurry.

674
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,478
If they come to the shop,
even try to avoid your eye

675
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,546
contact.

676
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,648
They afraid if you get my eye

677
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:01,352
contact, I'm going
to rip you off or...

678
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,554
Or make you buy something
that they don't want?

679
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:04,555
I don't know.

680
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:05,091
I don't know.

681
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:06,092
Do they buy?

682
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:07,125
They don't even say hello.

683
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:08,893
They don't buy?

684
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:09,561
Of course.

685
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:12,897
We call them penguin.

686
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,766
They have short hands that
don't get into the pockets.

687
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,669
I'm just kidding.

688
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,564
When Tangier was Interzone

689
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:48,133
back in the day, it seemed to

690
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:49,167
some I'm sure as if the ex-pats

691
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,302
outnumbered the locals.

692
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,304
That was never true, but you

693
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,406
certainly could live a life

694
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:59,144
apart, make your own world
within the existing one.

695
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:03,014
Reinvent yourself and live

696
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:08,553
entirely within a universe
of your own creation.

697
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:12,690
Far from the grand socco is
a 14-acre estate owned by

698
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,225
Christopher Gibbs, a well-known

699
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:17,395
dealer of antiques
and longtime ex-pat.

700
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:20,465
Today, he's having
a garden party.

701
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:23,601
Who's coming?

702
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,136
Jonathan you know.

703
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,171
Maggie Dean is from Scotland.

704
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:34,045
She's been living here
for more than a decade.

705
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:37,882
GP, a Frenchman who has a
hind in a lot of businesses.

706
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:41,219
Including a cafe in the Kasbah.

707
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,887
Years living here, unknown.

708
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:43,988
An American, she's been here

709
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,491
forever, led many lives, I
gather, and occasionally

710
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:50,295
translates books from
magrabbi to English.

711
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,730
And the dashing and mysterious

712
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,599
baron, an artist from Chile who

713
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,667
has been living and working in

714
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,603
the Kasbah since a hasty exit

715
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:06,604
from Puerto Rico for reasons
never fully explained.

716
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:17,388
On the menu, bastilla, a meat or

717
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,990
often pigeon pie, as traditional
Moroccan as it gets.

718
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:25,196
Today made by Gibbs' full-time

719
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,731
cooks, jamilla and Fatima.

720
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:27,765
It's chicken slow-cooked, pulled

721
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,368
or shredded and folded
into an egg mixture.

722
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,437
Cooked in a reduced
stock from the boil.

723
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:36,107
This is layered with blanched

724
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:39,277
almonds, powdered
sugar, and cinnamon.

725
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:42,413
The whole lot is wrapped
in a crepe-like dough.

726
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,015
After baking to a golden

727
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,584
crispiness, the final touch is a

728
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,654
dusting of even more
cinnamon and sugar.

729
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:51,789
It's got a sweet savory thing

730
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:56,994
