00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,229
and they have their
kids with them.

533

Each trunk that say something,
it's your autograph.

534
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,859
If you see it coming and
then you see the car

535
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,675
and the grille and then you see
the 2-2 chromes, it's like,

536
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:44,654
"Oh, my God, here comes"

537
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,823
whoever the guard is
of your neighborhood.

538
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:50,035
They basically, like,
legends in the streets.

00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,704
Are all of these... like, are
they works in progress?

540
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,124
- Are people constantly... - I think it's got to be
- a work in progress.

541
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:56,958
I think a slab, you
gonna stay doing it.

542
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,710
Yeah, always changing 'em.

543
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,128
They get expensive, real talk.

544
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:03,299
Like, all these cars out
here, they probably spent

545
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,381
a bankroll on all of 'em.

are either, are you?

551
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,919
Well, really, we barely see
people in the back seat

552
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,898
of somebody car out here.

553
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,066
He's shaking his head.

554
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,026
"Nobody's getting
in the back seat."

555
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,485
Because you got to lean.

556
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,904
You got to lean back.

557
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,947
So that mean whoever
back here can't be long.

558
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,782
So I'm thinking about my
Lincoln now, you know.

559
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,993
Maybe I'm thinking, like,
crocodile skin on the outside.

560
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,058
I'm thinking about pony.

00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,120
Pony?

562
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,664
From a horse or cow skin.

563
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,541
Like Palomino kind of a thing?

564
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,543
Palomino?

565
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,543
That'd be fresh.

566
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,837
It'd be evil.

567
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,130
Pay him no mind.

It's also where you can find
the legendary family-run

00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:02,357
Burns BBQ, a place not
unfamiliar to me.

573
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,945
I first came here 15 years
ago on some long-lost

574
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:10,240
travel program on a
network far, far away.

575
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:13,056
Founder Roy Burns has passed
on to the great open pit

576
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:16,247
in the sky since last I
was here, but his son

577
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,831

on the tradition of making

578
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,376
some of the best East
Texas-style barbecue

579
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,877
you can find around here.

580
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:23,796
It's been a while.

581
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,798

here, the grandfather

was here back then.

583
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,466
You in the right place
for some barbecue, man.

584
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,531
What do you do?

585
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:31,594
You do ribs and brisket?

586
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,596
They do all that.

587
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:33,596
You do all that.

588
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,704
What is that?

589
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:37,810

Boss Hogg.

592
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,855
Wow. I could drink
a lot of that.

593
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,025
Baked potato.

594
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,193
Okay, that's gonna work.

595
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,134
A torpedo-size baked potato
filled with cheddar cheese

596
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:53,490
and chopped barbecue beef
and homemade link sausage,

597
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:58,371
slow-cooked pork ribs, big-ass
beef ribs, and brisket.

598
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,415
Whoa. Okay, I got
a baked potato.

599
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,499
This baked potato is yours.

600
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,876
It's... it's marvelous.

601
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,463
That thing is, like, gigantic.

602
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:07,839
My mother always said,
"Never eat anything

603
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,132
bigger than your head."

604
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,717
And that's about the
size of a human head.

605
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,636
That look good, though.
Ain't gonna lie.

606
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,638
So everybody born here?

607
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,598
Born and raised.

608
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,556
Born and raised.

609
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,017
Has the town changed at all?

610
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:19,956
A lot.

611
00:25:19,957 --> 00:25:20,893
Yeah, in what way?

612
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,063
You know, it was like a
big small town at first.

613
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,565
Now it's becoming like
a real city, you know.

614
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,693
Is that good or bad?

615
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,818
Depend on what you do.

616
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,320
Good and bad, kind of.

617
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,947
A lot of the stuff we was
really into back in the day,

618
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,116
these new kids or these
people from out of town

619
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,285
really ain't into,
even the music.

620
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,121
Like, back in the day,
Houston was so independent.

621
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,998
Like, I was selling so many
records out of the trunk

Very. You know, the whole
culture from the cars

630
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,461
to the sippin' syrup and the
music itself... First of all,

631
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:07,273
what's sippin' syrup?

632
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,859
Syrup is promethazine
and codeine.

633
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,027
It was a cough syrup.

634
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,821
But then they mixed it
with soda out here.

635
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,948
Why is that the drug
of choice here?

636
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,658
Maybe because you
just see how it is.

637
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,494
Everything is so
chill and laidback.

638
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,079
In Atlanta, everything
was turnt up.

639
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,582
Out here, everything is slowed
down, 'cause I guess we're

640
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,581
a more laidback culture.

641
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,001
So at various points
in your career,

642
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,420
clearly, somebody
said, "Well, look."

643
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,672
"Why don't you move out here?"

644
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:30,922
L.A. is good.

645
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,632
- The money's out here.
- "The deals are out here."

646
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:33,654
Right.

647
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:34,675
But here you are.

648
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,719
Why stay?

649
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,180
I tried to go to I.A.,
and the people out

650
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,870
there are so thirsty to
try to be a star that

651
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:42,141
they fake and they crooked.

652
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,561
It was like I don't want to be
around those type of people.

653
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,312
I want to be around
good, genuine people.

654
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,689
Is Houston a good place to live?

655
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,400
Yup, great place.

656
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:51,901
Cost of living is cheap.

657
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,320
It stays hot and warm.

658
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,760
It's never snowing
to where you got

659
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:56,781
to shovel your driveway.

660
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,450
And the food is the
greatest out here,

661
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,785
and... and the black women... I
don't care where you go.

662
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,912
There ain't no better black women.
And that's what it is.

663
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,790
♪ I'm from H-Town, so you

666
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,687
It's a 90-minute drive
south from Houston

667
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,816
to the town of Palacios
on the Matagorda Bay.

668
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,737
And like a lot of the communities
down here, the principal

669
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:37,654
industry is fishing,
shrimp in particular.

670
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,116
It's also where,
beginning in the 1970s,

671
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,369
as the Vietnam War ground to
its ignominious conclusion,

672
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,957
the thousands of Vietnamese
found new lives and a new home.

673
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,107
To have remained would have
meant, in most cases, arrest,

674
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:55,381
imprisonment, reeducation
camps, or worse.

675
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,592
So all you want is
shrimp at this point.

676
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,178
Yeah.

677
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,660
I got shrimp and fish.

678
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:03,139
But I got enough fish.

679
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,287
Shrimp, you take.

680
00:28:04,288 --> 00:28:05,433
Yup, yup. Big shrimp.

681
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,727
- The small, we don't get the shrimp.
- You don't want it.

682
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,685
No, I don't want to.

683
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,981
The shrimping has declined
considerably since the 1980s,

684
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,609
but the bay still provides
a solid livelihood

685
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,925
for people like Vin Nguyen,
who made it out of Vietnam

686
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:19,780
on a tiny handmade boat.

687
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,033
His engine died, and he
and his family were lost

688
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,934
in the South China Sea for
nine days before being rescued

689
00:28:25,935 --> 00:28:27,372
by a cargo ship.

690
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,291
He became a United
States citizen in 1990

691
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,918
and raised his family
here in Palacios.

692
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,462
So what year did you come here?

693
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,047
How long have you
been doing this?

694
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:40,218
I have been... I start
for shrimp on 1985.

695
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,470
And what year did you
arrive in this country?

696
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,472
I left my country 1979.

697
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,391
How old were you
when you got here?

698
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,539
21-year-old.

699
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,686
You were 21.

700
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,685
So why shrimp?

701
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,436
How did you come
to this business?

702
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,523
- Because my... my... my cousin.
- Cousin, okay.

703
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:54,024
- He was living here.

Take me out to the ballgame,
man, though the smell wafting

881
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:56,296
from behind the bleachers is
not hot dogs, or popcorn,

882
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,589
or roasting peanuts.

883
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,509
It's a hell of a lot
better, actually.

884
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,803
Basically, it's practically
like baseball.

885
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,056
First international game,
believe it or not,

886
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,348
was USA versus Canada.

887
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,059
Really?

888
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,769
Yes, in 1844.

889
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,798
Yeah, I don't know if you knew,
but cricket is second-most

890
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:19,050
watched sport... I... I
just read that.

891
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:20,071
Yes.

892
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,761
India is number one.

893
00:37:21,762 --> 00:37:23,448
USA is number two.

894
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,576
I do like a sport
where you can aim

895
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,829
at somebody's crotch, though.

896
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,079
I think that's sort of awesome.

897
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,206
I'm not even gonna
try and explain

898
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,707
the sport of cricket to you.

899
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:35,337
There's a ball, and there's
bats, and I think you run

900
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:36,921
to, like, base.

901
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,278
Go out to Sardar Patel Stadium
in Houston's Richmond

902
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:41,341
neighborhood, and ask
league president

903
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,200
of the Houston Indian Cricket
Club, Kuldeep Patel,

904
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:45,262
what it's all about.

905
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,807
He knows. He was once a
big cricket star himself.

906
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,143
Let's go. Let's go!

907
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:51,476
Who's winning?

908
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,187
The first team scored 120 runs.

909
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,606
- Right.
- They're chasing right now.

910
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:55,503
I see.

911
00:37:55,504 --> 00:37:57,609
So we can't really say,
'cause they haven't

912
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,608
had an opportunity.

913
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,776
Exactly, right?

914
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,069
See, this is why
it didn't happen.

915
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,779
We need... we like
winners in America.

916
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,155
We like to know who's
winning at all times.

917
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,490
But this is very
high-energetic game.

918
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:09,328
Baseball, when we watch baseball,
it's kind of slow to us.

919
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,290
- When we're playing... Well, even us, it is.
- It's a slow game.

920
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:14,499
It's really all about
the snacks in baseball.

921
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,877
Hot dogs.

922
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,253
The shitty hot dogs too.

923
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,880
And the beer's even worse.

924
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,907
Now for a hot dog.

925
00:38:24,908 --> 00:38:26,595
Oh, no, right.

926
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:29,890
Now for some tandoori chicken,
cooked to perfection.

927
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,685
Some spicy, tender, and totally
delicious curried goat.

928
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:37,440
And made-to-order
potato masala dosas.

929
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,817
Are there fewer rules here?

930
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,735
The caste system, you
lose that right away?

931
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,779
It's not right away,
you got to understand,

932
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,470
because when... when
somebody's come from a rich,

933
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,575
middle-class family, it's
gonna take them a minute

934
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,162
to get used to that
culture shock over here.

935
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,579
It's going to take
about two years.

936
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,791
Like when I got married,
back then, in the '90s,

937
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,543
it was like I was supposed to
marry a girl from my caste.

938
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,672
It was an issue then, but
now it's not an issue.

939
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,800
Now, you know, 20 years
later, it's changed.

940
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,718
What about white Houstonians?

941
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,928
Welcoming? Nice?

942
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,722
In my experience, I
moved from Singapore.

943
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,309
Right.

944
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,433
First six months, whenever
we used to go anywhere

945
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,229
and say we recently moved
to USA, and everybody go,

946
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,021
"Welcome to Texas."

947
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,252
Welcome to Houston.

948
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:19,481
"Welcome to USA."

949
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,525
And, like, that made
us very comforted.

950
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,194
I mean, that's not
the stereotype.

951
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:26,613
The stereotype is that this
is an intolerant state

952
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,365
filled with, you know,
right-wing cowboys

953
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,616
who don't like foreigners.

954
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,452
Not Houston.

955
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:31,285
Definitely not.

956
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,578
In the beginning, you might
feel that Texans are,

957
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,792
like, not that friendly to
you, but once you know them,

958
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,791
they are really friendly people.

959
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,461
We see this is the
best place to dream

960
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,587
and achieve the dream.

961
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:46,489
The same opportunities in India
I get, I won't make as much

962
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,136
of my life as I would over here.

963
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,473
You work hard in this
country, and if you put your

964
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:53,996
mind to something, you
know, it is achievable,

965
00:39:53,997 --> 00:39:58,020
and I think so America
is land of opportunity

966
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,439
and best place to
stay in the world.

967
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,361
Some people say, "Make
America great again."

968
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:08,364
I say America was
great all along.

969
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:11,158
Some of us just forgot why.

970
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,577
It's great because your
grandfather and my grandfather

971
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,330
and just about everybody's
damn grandfather

972
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,124
or great-grandfather
crammed themselves,

973
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:23,087
snuck, bought their way,
or was dragged onto a boat

974
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,463
and one way or another
allowed themselves

975
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,300
eventually to dream.

976
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,699
You still can.

977
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,095
There's still room.

978
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,411
And in some places in
America, apparently you

979
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:36,474
are still welcome.

980
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,312
Welcome, stranger.

00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:42,147
