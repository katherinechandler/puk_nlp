1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,840
You know what I like?
I like Sichuan.

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,382
Man, I love the food here.

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,050
You know what else I like?

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,678
Torturing my friend Éric Ripert.

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,182
I don't know why. Maybe it's

6
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:17,267
because he's so damn nice.

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,060
- You high, man?
- You look high.

8
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,061
I am.

9
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,647
- But I like it.
- Yeah?

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,649
You could pretty much
tear his toenails out

11
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,860
and he'd still find something
nice to say about you.

12
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,278
He's so polite, yet
if you look closely,

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,658
and I do, his discomfort
can be exquisite.

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,684
He's the devil.

15
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:38,998

of all the things I
love about China.

29
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,493
The collision between very,
very old and very new,

30
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:40,517
an exploding middle
class, a lot of history,

31
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:44,021
and food that could burn
you down to a charred,

32
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:45,606
smoking little stump.

33
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,362
Sichuan province, located
in the southwest of China,

34
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,156
over a thousand
miles from Beijing.

35
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,158
A region so fertile and lush,

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,788
that it's been referred to
as "China's breadbasket."

37
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,583
And it's capital, Chengdu.

38
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,168
Despite its
ever-growing skyline,

39
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,839
it hasn't lost its deep
culinary roots and traditions.

40
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:15,176
- And I figured, if I'm
going back to Sichuan

41
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,178
I should bring a friend.

42
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,180
Someone unused to the...
How shall I say...

43
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,142
Level of heat commonly
found in the food here.

44
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,229
Someone who's never
been to China before

45
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,231
and is unused to its ways.

46
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,821
I'm talking, of course,
about chef Éric Ripert

47
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,197
three star Michelin restaurants

48
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,408
as New York's Le Bernardin.

49
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,913
-So welcome to China, Éric.

50
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:44,205
-Thank you.

51
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,374
- First time in the mainland?
- Yeah, yes.

52
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,626
And I'm very surprised already
about, uh, what I see

53
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,253
in the city here.

54
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,215
I was expecting like, uh,
kind of a gigantic Chinatown

55
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,592
that we have in New York.

56
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,803
That's some racist shit right
there, I'm tellin' ya.

57
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,347
No, it's very surprising.

58
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:00,848
The streets, they're very clean.

59
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,224
Just... it almost looks
like a European city.

60
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,019
Except for the air.

61
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,228
The air quality, I mean,
- maybe you've noticed

62
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,857
that haze...
- Yeah, - it's like the fog.

63
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,857
- That's not... that's not good.

64
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,233
But I'm definitely out
of my comfort zone.

65
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,652
- Really?
- For sure, yeah.

66
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,421
- Well, good.
- Well, I'm hungry, you hungry?

67
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,530
-Yeah.

68
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,700
- Noodles, that's where you
should start around here.

69
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,243
Chengdu is famous for
little spots like this.

70
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:26,102
Don Don Chen Shui Mian,
named after a much beloved

71
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:27,916
Chengdu noodle snack.

72
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,460
Oh, yeah, now we're talkin'.

73
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,648
I've never been good
with chopsticks.

74
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,965
- Really?

75
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,257
- Never.

76
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,488
This is not bad.

77
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:38,677
I can grab it.

78
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,889
Kind of.

79
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,787
Oh, yeah.

80
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,267
That is awesome.

81
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,436
So it's all spicy.

82
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,439
The peppers get on you
I'm... I'm like... whew.

83
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,526
Yeah, well, this is
just day one, man.

84
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,655
I'm surprised you don't
drink beer with that.

85
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,532
Dude, it's only 11:20
in the morning.

86
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,659
What kind of an animal
do you think I am?

87
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,762
- Well, 'cause there's nothing
- to soothe your taste buds.

88
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,207
This is a good sort
of, uh, intro.

89
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,669
- So we're gonna have fun.
- Oh, man.

90
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,295
We're gonna eat well.

91
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,549
You're gonna drink -a
little more than you like.

92
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,549
- Okay.

93
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,885
And I have to stress
this to you now, Éric,

94
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,303
you cannot refuse.

95
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,698
Don't look at me
with eyes like that.

96
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,515
I'm saying it's... drinking

97
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,308
culture is very important here.

98
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,745
And if we go to,
like, a formal meal,

99
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,897
your ability to drink leads
to a number of assumptions

100
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,148
about you, you know?

101
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,193
Your general
manliness, penis size.

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,529
I'm comfortable with my size.

104
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,324
Think of yourself
as an ambassador

105
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,536
not only for America, but
for... for France, Éric.

106
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,331
But I am an ambassador
of Le Bernardin as well.

107
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,333
Of the people who work
with me and so on.

108
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,728
- Right.
- You don't want people, uh,

On the other side of the world

110
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,339

sends pussies out there

111
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,339

It's perfectly okay to be
shitfaced at the table.

119

00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:36,081
of a challenge, I have to say.

179
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,874
Oh, yeah, now we're talking.

180
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,667
You're gonna love
this dish, my friend.

181
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,295
Yeah, let's, uh,
find the chicken

182
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,296
in the pile of chili.

183
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,923
Pile of chili.

184
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:49,261
"Laziji" literally means
spicy chicken but the dish,

185
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:52,513
in practical terms,
is a game of finding

186
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,309
the bits of chicken
in the mountain

187
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,309
of ass-burning goodness.

188
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,185
Come on, it's fun for
the whole family.

189
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,937
"Is that a tiny nubbin
of hacked chicken,

190
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,522
or a nuclear cluster
of chili seeds?"

191
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,027
The Sichuan peppers are
the... for me, like... the really

192
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:06,111
super-addictive.

193
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,113
- Oh, yeah, I feel them now.
- It's all tingling.

194
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,156
- Yeah.

195
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:10,157
-Like that, right.

196
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,409
There's a scientific
name for the process,

197
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,787
- for what happens, it's san chul...
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:18,957
Is the biological agent
that causes confusion

199
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,334
in your nervous system.

200
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,015
- Confusion?
- Tingling. Confusion, yeah.

201
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,130
That's what I feel
right now, yeah.

202
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,591
You're gonna love this dish.

203
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,429
I'm totally confused,
I'll tell you that.

204
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,389
- Oh, mapo doufu.
- Oh, my favorite.

205
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,724
That one, I have the
feeling, is the killer.

206
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,767
Look at that, man.

207
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,146
That is some goodness
right there.

208
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,731
For me, the apex
of Sichuan food.

209
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,985
My absolute favorite,
improbably enough,

210
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,945
is a tofu dish.

211
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:53,158
This tofu dish, the
legendary mapo doufu,

212
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,369
or pock-marked granny tofu.

213
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,372
Ground pork or beef,
cubes of bean curd

214
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,582
in a rich, deeply-nuanced,

215
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,586
fiery but intensely satisfying
sauce of chili oil,

216
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,007
bean paste, garlic shoots,
ground Sichuan peppercorns,

217
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,007
and MSG.

218
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:13,094
This dish done right
has got it all.

219
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,701
Oh, that's so good.

220
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:19,767
It's a perfect balance of
stuff going on in here.

221
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,270
I just love, love,
love this dish.

222
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,981
Actually, the spiciness
makes me already,

223
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,441
like, uh, feeling that I
drunk -kind of, you know?

224
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,776
- Really?

225
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,238
Yeah.

226
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,281
- I'm like... - You high, man?
- You look high.

227
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,158
- I am. But I like it.

228
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,993
-Yeah?

229
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,621
And if you ever, like, have
a hangover, and you will,

230
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,478
my friend, you will,
um, this will scare

231
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,292
the evil right out.

232
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,295
It's prepping me for
a drinking night.

233
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,672
- The glory of France...
- Shut up.

234
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,216
Is on your shoulders.

235
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,223
And tong jiao yu, green
peppercorn fish,

236
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:02,018
served in a simmering vat
of seasoned fish broth,

237
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,644
laced heavily with
fresh and dried

238
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,169
green Sichuan peppercorns
and finished off

239
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,443
with a heavy pour of
boiling hot vegetable oil.

240
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:13,447
I think this is the most
numb you are gonna feel.

241
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,823
It's going to be a
challenge, this one, for me.

242
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,659
Any second now,
that perfect hair

243
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,288
is gonna burst into flames.

244
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,039
- That's good.
- Mm-hmm.

245
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,541
Yeah.

246
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,127
Man, I love the food here.

247
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,545
How does that feel?

248
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,925
You know, it change... it
change you physically.

249
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,677
Like, I... I feel like
my face is changing.

250
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,013
Changing... Like,
my eyes are in a

251
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,516
- different position. My...
- I got news for you.

252
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,516
- Right?

253
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,331
Yeah, it... you better look

254
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:45,103
at yourself in a mirror, man.

255
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,563
All right, let's just slow down.

256
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:47,647
-Don't rush.

257
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,689
- Slow down.

258
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,358
Slow down a little bit.

259
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
Man, those peppercorns
are awesome.

260
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,904
I need towels. Holy cow.

261
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,949
-Whoa.

262
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,700
They're all looking at
me from the kitchen.

263
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,496
They're like, "Is this guy
gonna survive or what?"

264
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,667
Thank you.

265
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,506
And do I have to wear
one of those vests?

266
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,132
Ah, jeez.

267
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,344
You're gonna sink like
a stone in this thing.

268
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,307
My friend Éric is a Buddhist.

269
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,518
Not a weekend Buddhist either.

270
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,727
A serious, long-term
practitioner

271
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,146
of Tibetan Buddhism.

272
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,731
It's what makes him
so different from me.

273
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,108
He, for instance, is nice.

274
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,569
I am not always so nice.

275
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,322
On the rock is something
written in Chinese.

276
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,534
Maybe it's, you know,
"Gift shop this way."

277
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,330
-Whoa, check it out, man.

278
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,706
- I know.

279
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,274
About two hours south of
Chengdu at the confluence

280
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:55,215
of the Min Jiang, Dadu,
and Qingyi Rivers

281
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,133
is the giant Leshan Buddha

282
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,345
carved out of the cliff
wall back in 713.

283
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,763
It still stands as the largest

284
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,765
stone Buddha in the world.

285
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,371
-Whoa, that was pretty awesome.

286
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:07,935
- That was beautiful, no?

287
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,022
And me without my selfie stick.

288
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,149
Though Éric's Buddhism
diverges somewhat

289
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,569
from the kind practiced
here, as you might imagine,

290
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,614
the site is respected and
revered by all Buddhists.

291
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,827
I am respectful of
faiths not my own

292
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,621
and I am more than happy to let

293
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,373
my friend do what he does.

294
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,957
It means a lot to him.

295
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,086
And like I said, I respect that.
Really.

296
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,594
-Pretty cool.

297
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,761
- Isn't it?

298
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,607
All right.

299
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:55,816
This is a tasty rabbit
head dispensary.

300
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,816
All right.

301
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,277
- Is it here? No.
- Is it here?

302
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,613
Yeah, man. That's what
you've been waiting for.

303
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,032
But all this time, in a
little evil part of my brain,

304
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,244
I've been secretly looking
forward to this moment.

305
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,289
A tasty Sichuan snack
famous and much-loved

306
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,831
around these parts.

307
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,208
I'm talkin' bunny heads, yo.

308
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,002
Tasty, tasty bunny heads.

309
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,150
-I think you use the glove.

310
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:17,255
-Yeah.

311
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,048
Like you're doing a
little prostate exam.

312
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,841
- Look at it.
- Look at those teeth.

313
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,010
- He hates it... whoa.
- Oh, you have the tongue too.

314
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,846
Yank the jaw right out.

315
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,202
Oh, that's good.

316
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:28,516
That is delicious.

317
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,478
Seriously spicy, delicious,
flesh still clinging

318
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,440
to little Thumper's skull,
look at those little teeth.

319
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,734
And the best part, after
you rip off the jaw

320
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,446
and split the skull... the
tasty, chicklet-sized brain.

321
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,864
Mmm, it's a lot of meat.

322
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,866
Suck that brain right out.

323
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,869
I'm not a fan of brains,
but I'm gonna try.

324
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,889
- You haven't had these brains.
- Rabbit brains are different.

325
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,040
They're not like
custardy creamy.

326
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,251
They're kind of like a
little... a little like uni.

327
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,087
♪ Here comes Peter Cottontail ♪

328
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,880
♪ Hoppin' down the bunny trail ♪

329
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,924
Right into my mouth.

330
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,259
How did you crack that?

331
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,885
You just get that soft spot.

332
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,306
You're gonna crack that
thumb in and pry it apart.

333
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,058
Aw, jeez.

334
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,687
Yeah, or you just
pound it on the curb.

335
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,272
So you basically crack it...
Oh, you're winnowing out

336
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:19,066
the brain with its own jawbone.

337
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,902
There's a certain country
justice to that.

338
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,339
I wish I'd known
about these things.

339
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,282
You know, I'm gonna
make these next Easter.

340
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,788
I mean the whole Easter egg
hunt, what does that have

341
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,788
to do with bunnies?

342
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,931
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

343
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,081
Bunnies don't lay eggs.

344
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,543
But they do have heads.

345
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,240
Look deep.

346
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:50,181
Deep into the murky depths
of that most glorious

347
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:52,517
and iconic of Sichuan dishes.

348
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,730
It burns. It burns you
down to your soul.

349
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,524
Cheers.

350
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,403
Local friend Xiao Bin and
musician friend, Seven,

351
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,532
Wu Jiao Ling, and Gao Shin

352
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,950
Almost everybody
around here does.

353
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,413
Eric, however, seems
apprehensive.

354
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,957
So this is Éric's first
time for Sichuan hotpot.

355
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,960
- Really?
- I think you're really going to enjoy this.

356
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,355
So this is particularly
good, right?

357
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,965
Which is known for
being spicy, so...

358
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,926
- Not a good news.

359
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,845
- I see it in my eyes already.

360
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,971
Yeah.

361
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,099
The way it works is, you
order a whole bunch

362
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,142
of ingredients, meat,
vegetables, noodles,

363
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,977
fish, whatever you like.

364
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,022
A lot of different
ingredients, and you feed them

365
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,022
into the pot.

366
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,667
The dog tail, we should
just throw them first.

367
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,377
Yeah, because that's
gonna take a long time.

368
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,985
- Yeah.
- Let's throw that tripe in.

369
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,363
It's called like "thousand
layer stomach."

370
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,989
- It's all going in there, man.
- Yeah.

371
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,158
The inner ring is a
more neutral broth.

372
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,620
The outer ring, though,
is the good stuff.

373
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,079
The hard stuff.

374
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,126
Oh, that's good man.

375
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,002
That's good.

376
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,589

- Bite.

378
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,303
- Awesome, right?

379
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,179
-Yes.

380

It only gets better, my friend.

381

Tofu.

383
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,018
- Oh, this is Tofu?
- Yeah.

384
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,124
-Oh, it's the skin on top?

385
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,187
- Yeah.

386
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,649
Common ingredients
like tofu and seaweed,

387
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,651
various meats and
fishes are stirred in

388
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,278
along with ingredients
that are, shall we say,

389
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,030
less familiar to the
Western palate.

390
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,429
- They get the duck...
- Yeah... Then they

391
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,702
reach inside, they grab
the... grab the intestines

392
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,054
and yank 'em out
of the live duck.

393
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,664
- No!
- Yeah.

394
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,707
Supposedly, that's the...
That gives you, like,

396
