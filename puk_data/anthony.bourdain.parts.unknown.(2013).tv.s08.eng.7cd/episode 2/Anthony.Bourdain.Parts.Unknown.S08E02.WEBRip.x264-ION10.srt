in Buffalo Prairie, Illinois.

535
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,297
Her family was forced to
sell when she was age two,

536
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:01,301
which is pretty damn country
already if you ask me.

537
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,930
As a country music traditionalist,
she struggled for years

538
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,682
to find her place within
Nashville's increasingly

539
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:11,353
pop-driven country scene and
the growing indie rock one.

540
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,356
In 2010, she lost one
of her twin sons

541
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:18,694
to a rare heart condition,
self-medicated with alcohol,

542
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:23,407
and ended up with every kind
of problem, including problems

543
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,367
of the legal kind.

544
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,828
She poured her heart
and every cent she had

545
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,082
recording an album in just
three days at the legendary

546
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,751
Sun Studios in Memphis,
selling her car

547
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:37,337
and her wedding
ring along the way.

The album, "Midwest
Farmer's Daughter",

563
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,231
was rejected 30 times
by the major labels

564
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,400
until she found herself on
the radar of Jack White

565
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,487
and his brilliant and
eccentric enterprise,

566
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,240
Third Man Records.

567
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,411
Third Man's impact on the
Nashville music scene

568
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,788
can't be understated.

569
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,415
With an eclectic, unpredictable
list of artists,

570
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,690
reissues, and obsessions,
they've tilted

571
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:01,463
the town's axis a bit making
Nashville the center,

572
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:06,052
not just of country
music, but also, what?

573
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,928
Of course, White has
also produced albums

574
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,264
for country music legends
like Loretta Lynn.

575
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,893
So if anything, they are
reliably unreliable

576
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,812
when predicting what
they might do next.

577
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,480
Let's get ready for a full take.

578
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:22,442
Right now what comes
next is Margo Price,

579
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,529
who's recording today at Third
Man's live music venue,

580
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,365
The Blue Room.

581
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,450
The recording, a unique,
one of a kind operation

582
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,453
because it's all going
directly to acetate.

583
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,664
Before digital and
before analog tape

584
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:39,710
was used for mastering, disk
recording was done live.

585
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,941
No editing.

586
00:23:40,942 --> 00:23:42,129
No overdubs.

587
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,674
Redirecting this process
on this 1953 lathe,

588
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,928
Third Man has mastered a
number of albums like this

589
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,848
giving listeners as close to a
live experience as possible.

590
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,474
Also, it's kind of cool.

591
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,415
Here's at Third Man in the
Blue Room, it's the only place

592
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,479

you can actually do

00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,108

debuted on Billboard's Top
Country chart at number 10

605
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,982
in its opening week
and was this year's

606
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:46,235
number one country
album in the UK.

607
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,528
Margo's promotional tour
includes performances

608
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,531
on Saturday Night Live,
"Conan", "Colbert",

609
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,617
and the Grand Ole Opry itself.

610
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,391
But before heading out on the
road, the band and friends

611
00:24:56,392 --> 00:25:00,791
gather one last time at
Margo's East Nashville home.

612
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,336
Her husband and bass player
in the band, Jeremy,

613
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,838
prepares biscuits with
pimento and cheese,

614
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,174
topped with chopped bacon.

615
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,614
Along with red wine braised
short rib on a crostini

616
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:12,636
with goat cheese.

617
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:13,616
Yeah, right.

618
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:14,554
Yeah, oh, yeah.

619
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,159
Nice.

620
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,722
It's cold.

621
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,270
Do you guys eat like
this all the time?

622
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:21,875
No.

623
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:22,438
He cooks.

624
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,814
He cooks like this all the time.

625
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,649
He's worked in, like,
every restaurant in town.

626
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,444
Yeah, we've all been in
the restaurant business.

627
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:29,736
You, you, you.

628
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,573
He just got fired from a job
over on the west... sorry.

629
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,452
Way to go, Vernon.

630
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,062
First of all, let me
ask, who here is from

631
00:25:42,063 --> 00:25:43,209
Nashville originally?

632
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,584
Exactly, she is.

633
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,233
This has been pretty
much the story

634
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:48,588
of my experience here so far.

635
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,007
You know, the town
has a reputation.

636
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,009
There are so many really
good musicians here.

637
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,387
Does that make it harder
to break out here?

638
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:58,057
And ultimately, what
happens if you suck here?

639
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,643
Like, I mean, if you can't,
if you play country Western...

640
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,875
I mean, it is... - And you
cannot... you're not good

641
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,857
at your instrument, can you
make a living here and suck?

642
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,088
Absolutely.

643
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:09,276
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

644
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,404
Not to say, like,
there's tons of bands

645
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,281
that suck or something here,
but when I came here,

646
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,783
I wasn't good enough,
and I went out to some,

647
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,911
like, writers rounds, and
I learned very quickly

648
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,871
that I was... I had to
be a better player.

649
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,415
I had to be a better singer.

650
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,623
I had to be a better writer.

651
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,752
And, like, so, you know, you
work hard because you're

652
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:27,627
surrounded by that.

653
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,713
It's like you're
typically playing to,

654
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,426
like, a whole room of, you
know, pickers and writers.

655
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,950
And so it's like, how many
Nashville musicians does it take

656
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:38,055
to change a light bulb?

657
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,848
One to do it, and
20 to stand around

658
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,225

664
00:27:06,313 --> 00:27:09,169
have always come here for
something metaphysical.

665
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,089
I mean, they say, "Well, it's
I wanna work with particular"

666
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,089
session musicians,"

667
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,050

Yes.

669

of a metaphysical decision.
