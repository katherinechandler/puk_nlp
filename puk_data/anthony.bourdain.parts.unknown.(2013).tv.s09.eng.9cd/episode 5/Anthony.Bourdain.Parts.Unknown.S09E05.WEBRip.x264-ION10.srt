1
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:11,133
The C-130 Hercules
is past the point of no return,

2
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:12,867
the point at which
there's not enough fuel

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,800
to safely turn back, no matter

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,133
what the weather is on the ice.

5
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,733
It's loud back here,

6
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:22,300
the moan of four massive
props relentless.

7
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,133
I'm dressed like all of us

8
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,393
who've been approved
to make this journey

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,167
in the same regulation gear

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,367
as required by
the National Science Foundation

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
for all flights
and means of conveyance

12
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:34,033
on the ice:
thick goose down parka

13
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,167
known by one and all as Big Red,

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
heavy waterproof overalls,

15
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:39,867
inflatable buddy boots,

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,100
gloves, long underwear, cap.

17
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:45,100
I am talking layers.

The runway is frozen
sea ice, 10 feet thick.

31
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,000
The airport shuttle,
Ivan the Terra Bus,

32
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,700
a "Road Warrior" -looking
behemoth

33
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:50,433
that takes us slowly
towards our destination.

34
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:55,500
We're driving Ivan.
40 feet long. 67,000 pounds.

35
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,033
23 years old.

36
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,867
Made out of some
good Canadian steel.

37
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,133
Sometimes the heat
actually works.

38
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,667
This year it does.

39
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,500
It is no short hop
to Antarctica,

40
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:14,233
and no easy thing to see it
the way it should be seen:

41
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:18,200
the last un-[...]-up
place on Earth.

42
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:30,633
Here we are. Try to get plenty
of rest and enjoy the Antarctic.

43
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:34,967
McMurdo Station, the largest
U.S. base on the continent.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,633
The hub, supply
and support center

45
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,067
for everything we do
here in Antarctica.

46
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,767
The pursuit of pure science.

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,433
It ain't pretty.
It looks like a mining camp.

48
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,500
But look closely
and you notice things,

49
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:48,667
like the total absence
of litter.

50
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,067
Not a single cigarette butt.

51
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,867
It's one of the most
carefully-regulated

52
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,067
communities on the planet,

53
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,300
and it is a community...
A tightly-knit,

54
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,700
highly-organized,
very odd subculture

55
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,333
of just under
1,000 people in summer

56
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:06,667
and 150 in winter all working
towards the same thing

57
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,900
in this most remote, barren,

58
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,900
yet stunningly
beautiful continent.

59
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:14,767
Work is seasonal in McMurdo,
and it's the type of place

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,900
that demands a very special
kind of individual.

61
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,033
Everyone is interdependent

62
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:24,167
and comes to realize
that very quickly.

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,300
The scientists, known
in local parlance

64
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,200
as "beakers," depend absolutely

65
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:30,967
on a support community
of specialists

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,200
like the "carps," or carpenters,

67
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,100
heavy equipment operators,

68
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,433
the fuelies, riggers, pilots,

69
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,733
wasties, cooks.

70
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:43,667
Like I said, it takes
a special breed of hard-ass

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,900
to not just make it
down here, but like it.

72
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,967
You got to be tough.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,167
Right now I love
being in McMurdo,

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,433
because it's like being
at a spa for scientists.

75
00:04:56,467 --> 00:05:00,200
Doug MacAyeal is one of the
world's preeminent glaciologists

76
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,200
who's been coming to Antarctica
since the '70s.

77
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,033
The Coffee House,

78
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,300
one of three watering
holes on station.

79
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,200
It's not much to look at,

80
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,400
but offers a welcome
respite from the cold.

81
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:13,733
One thing about this continent
that's special

82
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,167
is the vertical hierarchy.

83
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,033
Everybody respects up
and down equally.

84
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,167
The janitor really
does have a sense

85
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,033
that their action
is right at the frontline.

86
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,600
That doesn't happen
as much elsewhere in the world

87
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:29,400
of science... tangibly
seeing a contribution.

88
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,500
What brought you here?
It's cold down here.

89
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:33,800
It's part of some
kind of personal honor.

90
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,600
People who come as a scientist
might think of their science

91
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:39,833
as driving them more than
thinking of coming to a place

92
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:42,033
that is definitely different

93
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:44,200
than anywhere else in the world.

94
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,133
Despite its seemingly
endless whiteness,

95
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,933
what you see is
a desert technically...

96
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,900
The highest and driest
on the planet.

97
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:03,333
A frozen desert holding 61%

98
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:06,833
of the entire world's
fresh water.

99
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,500
It looks like nothing lives.

100
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,567
You won't see a single plant,
a single leaf,

101
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,500
and certainly not a puppy.

102
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:17,433
Even the sun this time
of year never sets.

103
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:20,767
It moves in lazy circles
around the sky.

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,233
But shit is indeed moving.

105
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,933
Beneath your feet.
All around you.

106
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,800
Just very slowly.

107
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,233
An ice shelf is a kind of
glacier that flows off the land

108
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,967
but begins to float
in the ocean.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,900
- It's freshwater.
- It's freshwater ice,

110
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:37,200
and the ice itself
varies from the snow,

111
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,267
like today,
and down at the bottom,

112
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,000
ice that might have fallen
as snow 35,000 years ago.

113
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,333
It's the part of the Antarctic
ice sheet we call the Buttress

114
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,300
because it fringes
the entire continent.

115
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,367
It might take 50,000 years
for the ice at South Pole

116
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,333
to get into the raw sea
and bust off as an iceberg.

117
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:59,233
- Yeah.
- But it would take only 20,000

118
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:00,733
years or even 10,000 years

119
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,367
if the ice shelf wasn't there.

120
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,967
This is the biggest pile
of free ice in the solar system.

121
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,400
McMurdo is at the tip
of Ross Island,

122
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:13,233
surrounded by miles
of frozen sea.

123
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:17,300
There are a lot of different
types of ice down here.

124
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,100
Glaciology started about
50 years ago.

125
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,200
Our entire science
is driven by the fact

126
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,067
that we're still trying
to figure out

127
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,500
what Antarctica is doing
in terms of sea level...

128
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,033
How the ice sheet
is expanding or contracting,

129
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,533
how it's flowing,

130
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,233
whether it melts in some places,

131
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:35,367
how it busts off icebergs
that float away on the ocean.

132
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,700
And we're trying to come up
with some kind of a solid,

133
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,400
reliable statement

134
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:44,000
about what cities like
San Francisco and New York

135
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:47,167
and Shanghai have to plan for.

136
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:54,333
Antarctica for all too
obvious reasons remained free

137
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,433
of any sustained human contact

138
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:59,600
until the mid-20th century
when the U.S. Navy

139
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:01,400
launched Operation Deep Freeze,

140
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:04,300
an enormous logistical
enterprise that established

141
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:09,400
the first permanent base
here at McMurdo in 1955.

142
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,900
Deep down
in the ice caves were cut,

143
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,900
and here the supplies
were packed away

144
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,933
in a natural fridge.

145
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:21,233
Frozen meat perfectly preserved,
but where's that axe?

146
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,433
Let's have a bit
of 15-year-old ham.

147
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,367
Since the National
Science Foundation

148
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,067
took over from the Navy,
things have gotten a lot less

149
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,067
Wild West around here.

150
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
It feels like dorm life
at college.

151
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,267
Bathrooms are communal.

152
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,633
Everybody rotates
housekeeping duties.

153
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,567
And everybody shuffles off
at designated hours

154
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,767
to the galley,

155
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,267
where the cooks do the very best

156
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,767
they can, given
the infrequent delivery

157
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,033
of what are called with longing
tones around here

158
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,667
"freshies,"

159
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,900
or anything not frozen,
canned, or prepared.

160
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,467
Little connectivity I have

161
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,126
with the outside world
I owe entirely to you.

162
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,033
You've been
helping me enormously.

163
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:06,567
Joanie works IT and has been
coming here for nine seasons.

164
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,408
But it's coming, right?
I mean, sooner or later,

165
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,967
they're gonna put
a satellite up there

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,467
and everyone
down here is gonna...

167
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,860
Maybe. I mean, we could be
a long way away

168
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,700
from have cell service down here

169
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:16,633
and everybody having internet
like that at home.

170
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,500
It's really the last place
on Earth for cell service.

171
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,867
Christy is a heavy
equipment operator

172
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,533
coming for 19 seasons.

173
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:26,233
I actually started off
in two seasons in the galley,

174
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,433
and then I ended up getting
trained on the equipment.

175
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,900
So, you learned an entirely
new profession

176
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,600
so that you could stay here?

177
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:33,933
- Yeah.
- And Jules,

178
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,733
another heavy equipment operator

179
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:38,133
who can most likely
kick your ass, eat your lunch,

180
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,800
then kick your ass again,

181
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,233
has been coming
for an astonishing 38 seasons.

182
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,967
So, what were you doing before?

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
See, my mom worked
for the company

184
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,600
and she wanted me to come.

185
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,367
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause I didn't want to come.

186
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,793
She was trying to get rid
of you or what?

187
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,433
Yeah. She wanted to come.

188
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,126
When you first started coming,
how many women were here?

189
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,633
What was the ratio?

190
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,233
My first two years
were at South Pole.

191
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:57,867
There were probably
90 civilians.

192
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,700
I was the only female
at South Pole,

193
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,667
and there were probably
12 total at McMurdo

194
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,333
and probably 1,100 men.

195
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:05,793
Was the Navy still
running the place back then?

196
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,993
Yes, and I had a lot of respect

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,467
because the United States Navy

198
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,367
was the one that integrated
this place,

199
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,026
and originally down here
it was kind of this thing like,

200
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:13,900
"Shall we let women be here?"

201
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:15,533
Right.

202
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:16,960
And then we had an admiral
come down and he's like,

203
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,533
"Dude, where's all the women?"

204
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,500
And, "Oh, we don't have
facilities for them."

205
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,767
And he said, "Well, you goddamn
better get facilities for them."

206
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
When I first came down here,
the company was all about,

207
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:28,667
"Hey, this is special."

208
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,500
There's not very many civilians,

209
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:34,633
"you know, it's wild and free
and it's a great place to be."

210
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,733
Just looking out the window,
having seen what you see

211
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,233
on a regular basis

212
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,833
and experienced
what you experience,

213
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:43,567
is that an alienating
experience?

214
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,900
I really appreciate
how simple life is

215
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,700
and how little you need
to get by.

216
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,200
Like, you just pack a couple
duffel bags and you come down.

217
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,300
But then I find when I go home,

218
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,900
sometimes I get
caught up in the,

219
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:57,100
"I want. I need.
I want. I need."

220
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,967
And that's the part
that kind of bums me out.

221
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,260
And that's one of the things
I like about it

222
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,167
is that there's no rat race.

223
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,833
There's no errands. It's a
pretty egalitarian society here.

224
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:08,233
NSF sitting down at tables
with us, and the janitors

225
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,767
and the fuelies are as important

226
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,026
as the people
who run the station.

227
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,367
Nothing gets done without power,

228
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,767
and there's no power
without fuel.

229
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,133
There's no fuel without roads,

230
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,800
There's no roads without
heavy equipment.

231
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,567
So, it just kind of goes
from there

232
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,167
and you kind of appreciate
what everybody else's role is.

233
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,867
This is a place where things
are more powerful

234
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,733
that don't involve money.

235
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,367
You make lifelong friendships.

236
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,200
The beauty of this place
is astounding.

237
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:32,367
- There's no doubt.
- It's such a unique experience.

238
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,800
There is something
magical about being here.

239
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,233
A shared experience.

240
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:38,267
You know, a lot of people
get really hooked

241
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,567
on this place in its principal,

242
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I guess,

243
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,567
as to what it is.

244
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,233
In Antarctica,
the sun sets once a year

245
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,967
and rises once a year.

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Some twilight in late March,

247
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:11,367
then five months of darkness
and extreme cold

248
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,500
and weather conditions
lasting until September.

249
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,467
Six months of daylight...

250
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,100
The Antarctic summer season
where we are now.

251
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:24,567
Constant sunlight
reflecting off the ice,

252
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,533

For short hops, the main mode

Ryan Skorecki gets a lot

That's probably 60

Look at that massive
snow bridge right there, huh?

273
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,367
There's some good
building-sized blocks.

274

Right.

278
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,833
People climb around
in those things?

279
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:44,567
They don't usually.

280
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,667
They'll have drills to practice
extricating somebody.

281
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,400
There is a steep learning
curve to flying down here.

Slowly but surely climbing.
And it's -20° outside.

- Erebus.
- And that's Mount Terror.

288
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,267
This is Mount Erebus,

289
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,133
the southernmost
active volcano on Earth.

290
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:25,967
Antarctica was a great mystery
for most of human history.

291
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,733
Only a theory.

292
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:31,500
A great white space
at the bottom of the world.

293
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,533
We're just passing 8,500.
So, we'll go another 4,000.

294
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,833
You're gonna see the main crater

295
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:40,400

the first British

296

Antarctica explorers
like Scott and Shackleton,

297
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,300
and Norwegian Amundsen,

298
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,767
and the lengths of time
they endured them are,

299
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,967
well, horrifying to imagine.

300
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,400
They made their journeys
in wooden ships,

301
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:56,267
man-hauling equipment
across glaciers,

302
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,067
ice floes, mountains,

303
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,633
and frozen seas surviving
on penguin meat

304
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,900

305
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:08,200
You might start
to smell some sulfur.

306
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,733
Yeah. I smell that sulfur.

307
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,900
What's our altitude now?

308
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:21,500
13,200.

309
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:22,600
Cool.

310
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,067
About 22 miles from McMurdo

311
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,900
is Cape Royds,
where a penguin colony

312
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:36,900
of about 2,000
breeding pairs live.

313
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,200
Marine ecologist
Dr. David Ainley

314
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:42,900
has been studying
this colony for 20 years.

315
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,133
So, you're tagging
the young ones?

316
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,533
Right.

317
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:50,793
Do you follow them
through their entire life?

318
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,333
I mean, essentially?

319
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,500
Yeah. This year we've got
a bunch of individuals

320
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:56,167
that are 20 years old.

321
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,833
Why penguins? What brought you
to penguins initially?

322
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:00,467
Well, this kind of penguin

323
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,700
just does everything
with no secrets.

324
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,233
- Right.
- If you, you know,

325
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:06,400
ask the right question
and you're creative enough,

326
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,100
then they're gonna
give you the answer

327
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,067
without a lot of guessing.

328
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,367
What really interests me
is the relationship

329
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,867
of these penguins to the ocean.

330
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,300
Mm.

331
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,433
And how they fit
into the food web.

332
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:20,133
During the '90s,
small colonies like Cape Royds

333
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:22,400
were increasing much faster
than the large colonies

334
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:25,600
where the competition
for food was so intense.

335
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,100
In the last ten years,

336
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,733
colonies started
increasing again.

337
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:34,133
We think it's because of fishery
for Antarctic toothfish.

338
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,267
The toothfish and the penguins
eat the same prey,

339
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,267
so now there's more
fish available for adults

340
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,000
to capture
and then feed to their chicks.

341
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:42,533
Oh, so there's less competition,

342
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,567
therefore more
of the same prey available?

343
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,867
Yeah.

344
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,393
I haven't seen a lot of them
going in the water,

345
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,567
but they're looking
for some indicator

346
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,000
that there's fish down there?

347
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,526
They're afraid to cross
this ice crack

348
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,800
because leopard seals
might be in them.

349
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,267
They're very hesitant.

350
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,500
So then finally
they make the plunge.

351
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:04,293
I mean, they're very agile.
They don't look it.

352
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,067
At first blush
they appear clumsy,

353
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,867
but watching them,
they got a lot of moves.

354
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,500
Yeah. They're very, very agile.

355
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:13,167
Increasingly, people want
to see penguins.

356
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,667
They're much-loved by,
you know, children everywhere.

357
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,133
A lot of people would like to
come to Antarctica as tourists

358
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,633
and look at penguins up close

359
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,133
in their natural environment

360
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,167
without impacting them
in a negative way.

361
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,533
Is that a good thing?

362
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,067
The thing about Antarctica

363
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,067
is that most scientists
just kind of like,

364
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,200
you know, keep their nose
to the grindstone.

365
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:34,667
And so the only advocacy
for Antarctica

366
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,533
has to come from the public.

367
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:38,767
It's very valuable
to have these tours

368
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,367
because then people have
an ownership of,

369
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,093
you know, they've been there
and they see it.

370
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,600
Mm-hmm.
What keeps you coming back?

371
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:47,233
I mean, other than the work.

372
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:49,833
I wanted to come to Antarctica
because I'd heard it was

373
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,567
a very severe place
and, you know,

374
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,100
nature was the king, daunting.

375
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,233
Having that chance to be humbled

376
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:03,567
by something greater
than you is, I think,

377
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,133
an important part of being here.

378
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:36,433
Not all of Antarctica
is covered with ice.

379
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,967
60 miles out of town
are the dry valleys...

380
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:48,400
The 1% of the continent
devoid of snowfall.

381
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:51,233
Scott called it
the Valley of Death,

382
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,933
and it feels like Mars.

383
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:55,833
In fact,
they used to test out equipment

384
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:58,367
for Martian exploration here.

385
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,633
Desolate but beautiful.

386
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,167
The Canada Glacier,
a wall of ice,

387
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,867
right there where it seems
to have stopped short,

388
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,367
pulled back scraping up
a beach on a frozen lake.

389
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,967
Here is one of the NSF's oldest

390
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,033
and more legendary
field camps... Lake Hoare.

391
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:32,067
Everything comes
in by helicopter.

392
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,633
The base here supports a small
team of scientists and staff

393
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,300
working on a variety
of long-term projects.

394
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,433
It is, however, most legendary
for this woman.

395
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:43,700
- Hi. I'm Rae.
- Rae Spain, the camp's manager

396
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:47,233
who's been coming to
Lake Hoare for 19 seasons.

397
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,333
Said to be the best cook
on the continent.

398
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,967
This in an environment
where so-called freshies...

399
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,200
The rare fresh vegetable...

400
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,933
Is spoken of in hushed tones

401
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,867
of near-fetishistic
appreciation.

402
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,333
Staying over at Lake Hoare
is a rare privilege

403
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:07,600
enjoyed by few,
like Dr. Michael Gooseff,

404
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:11,200
a hydroecologist, and Dr.
Byron Adams, a biologist.

405
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,067
So, what are you
looking at here?

406
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,167
Everything that lives
here lives in the soil,

407
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,000
and we study the soil organisms.

408
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:18,733
Mostly the animals
that live here

409
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:22,200
but also the microbes
that those animals feed off of.

410
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:24,167
- Right.
- This is just a marker

411
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,633
to tell us to stay
on this trail.

412
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,467
Okay.

413
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,160
These soils are so sensitive
that if we walk off the trail

414
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,133
or whatever, we can
completely jack up

415
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,233
the soil organisms
that live below there.

416
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:35,000
- Oh, like that guy?
- Yeah, like that dude.

417
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:38,367
He's totally... oh,
he's gonna get wiped out.

418
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,933
When scientists came
and first started studying,

419
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,033
they thought that these
soils were sterile.

420
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,167
But we dispelled that myth.

421
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,700
When the glaciers melt
and the streams flow,

422
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,500
that's where you find life.

423
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:51,626
So, why does this area look
like this? Where's the ice?

424
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:53,733
How come the ground
is so soft and spongy?

425
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:57,233
The Polar Plateau where most
of the ice accumulates starts

426
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:59,367
to spread out towards
the edges of the continent,

427
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,333
but the Transantarctic
Mountains form a barrier

428
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:04,000
so the ice sheet
hits the mountains

429
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,700
and it can't get through.

430
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:07,493
The other thing is that there
are these really gnarly winds

431
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,700
that come off of them,
drop down on the plateau,

432
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:11,233
and then rush toward the edges

433
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:12,926
of the continent gushing
through these valleys.

434
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:15,233
So, it's a fluky
microclimate here?

435
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,200
We call it the Banana Belt
of Antarctica.

436
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:20,200
It's warm. We're coastal.

437
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:22,200
Life at Lake Hoare,
considering the limitations

438
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:24,900
and the difficulties,
is freaking luxurious

439
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:27,367
by continental standards.

440
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,867
Out here, by the way,
as everywhere on the continent,

441
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,667
every bit of waste
is separated and collected.

442
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,900
One pees in a bottle
and pours it in the barrel

443
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:41,567
where it is eventually collected
and shipped back to America.

444
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,867
Life here most definitely
has its advantages.

445
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,967
Rae and her staff seem always to
be making something delicious.

446
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,100
Homemade bread, scones,

447
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:58,967
muffins appear
throughout the day.

448
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,067
Tonight, it's barbecue
pork tenderloin.

449
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,933
Oh, that looks good.
Pork tenderloin? Damn.

450
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:10,800
Grilled mahi sticks and shrimp
marinated in chili sauce.

451
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,200
Homemade sourdough bread.

452
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:14,767
A roasted beet salad.

453
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,100
Oh, my gosh.
Look at the salad.

454
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:20,400
It's so purple and it
has avocado in it.

455
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:23,467
What cannot be fresh
is nonetheless delicious.

456
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,967
Edamame salad with
cranberries and carrots.

457
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,767
Roasted vegetables.

458
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,833
One might find oneself
enjoying a cocktail or two.

459
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:33,400
This is an amazing spread.

460
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:35,433
I know. Mmm.

461
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,133
What are you guys doing here?
What are you looking for?

462
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,033
I'm collecting water samples
in the streams

463
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:43,933
and also collecting samples
of the algae.

464
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:46,100
We're looking at the sign
of bacteria mass

465
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:50,133
which make this rainbow
shag rug in the streams,

466
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,967
which is super-cool.

467
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,093
Uh-huh. Well, you know, the
beginning of the 20th century

468
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,200
when scientists and explorers
were national heroes,

469
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,833
there was a hunger
for knowledge and discovery.

470
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,900
Not a good climate for facts,
though, we live in today.

471
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:05,300
- No.
- We may interpret our facts

472
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,700
differently but we don't get
to make up our own facts, right?

473
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,593
There are plenty of people
out there who believe

474
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,200
"The Flintstones"

475
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,167
is pretty much an accurate
portrayal of history.

476
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,700
Don't laugh, Mike, that...

477
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,333
Shut up. I know.

478
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:19,333
They're funding our science
in large part.

479
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,867
You want that connection between
the public and the scientist,

480
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,500
and that's something we don't
do a great job of back home.

481
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:26,200
I get this criticism
all the time, though,

482
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,567
that you scientists need
to do a better job

483
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,133
of presenting your research.

484
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,867
I get that. But I'm a professor
at a university.

485
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,967
I present knowledge
and information.

486
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,367
It's in the classes.

487
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,200
They learn
all this awesome stuff.

488
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:40,833
They're thoughtful.
They enter the world.

489
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,467
They make the world better.

490
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,533
But they don't do it
in a five-minute soundbite.

491
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,067
But we live in a terrible new
reality where you better have

492
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,333
a five-minute soundbite,
or they're coming for you.

493
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,067
Right, right.
We got to learn how to teach

494
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,067
evolutionary biology
140 characters at a time.

495
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,567
Yeah. Pretty much.

496
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,526
See, you guys just
need better press.

497
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:00,600
Yeah, yeah.

498
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,333
You went gathering data

499
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,667
that will potentially save
the world from flesh-eating,

500
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,600
anal-seeking algae.

501
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,300
♪

502
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:25,400
You need a giant nematode
to rampage through West Virginia

503
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:27,167
or some shit like that.

504
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,900
Then everybody will be extremely
interested in what you're doing.

505
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:33,367
In a battle between a nematode
and the algae, who's gonna win?

506
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,800
The algae.

507
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,800
- The nematodes eat algae.
- For now.

508
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,067
I'm betting on algae.

509
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,233
In this time you've all chosen
to come out here.

510
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:47,300
You've all been born
in the wrong century.

511
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,167
Why do you put up
with these people?

512
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,733
'Cause everybody here
is such incredible people.

513
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:55,600
I can't help it. I can't find
any place else like this.

514
00:25:55,633 --> 00:26:00,100
34 years later, I'm still
in love with the place.

515
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:02,400
By the way, this is
an amazing meal.

516
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:05,033
Lucky for us,
some freshies showed up today,

517
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:07,100
because it gets really
challenging.

518
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:10,700
It's her superpower.

519
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:12,567
'Cause I've got, like,
four drawers of spices.

520
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,033
Mm-hmm.

521
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,667
I think that can make
a difference.

522
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,667
- Makes it different.
- That meal was delicious.

523
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,433
Thank you. This is sort of
the last place on Earth

524
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:26,667
where pure science
seems to be celebrated

525
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,267
at every level of society,

526
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,500
where people are making
great personal sacrifices

527
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,033
in pursuit of knowledge.

528
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:35,900
That sounds quaint
where I come from.

529
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:39,267
But it's an entire
continent of seekers...

530
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,567
- Yeah.
- In a world that is

531
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,067
increasingly hostile

532
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,500
to basically everything
you're all about.

533
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:48,233
It's quite wonderful.

534
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:50,233
Wouldn't that be great,
though, huh?

535
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:53,400
If everyone played as nice
as we do with other nations?

536
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:57,867
Working together to do science,
collaborating?

537
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,400
- Yeah.
- Dream on, buddy.

538
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:09,100
The meal is followed by
a precarious trip

539
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:11,833
across the frozen lake
to the beach.

540
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:17,100
Because what's Antarctica about
if it ain't about a beach party?

541
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,300
♪

542
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,567
Gear 22.
Mack Center. Go ahead.

543
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,067
Gear 22, at 8-2-niner.

544
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,167
Gear 22, Roger. Thank you.

545
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,433
Another C-130.

546
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:10,933
The big, gorgeous workhorse
of the Antarctic

547
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,167
gets you to the ass-end
of the planet,

548
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,967
where it's north
every direction you go.

549
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,133
Bottom of the world.

550
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:21,033
So, I like to say this is
the biggest airplane

551
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,700
you can do little
airplane things with...

552
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,800
Sea, ski planes,
or float planes...

553
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,933
And we're trying to do
those same types of missions

554
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:29,800
with a C-130, which is unusual.

555
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,826
Everything they built
the station actually came on one

556
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:33,200
of these C-130s.

557
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,600
They had to build it
using trusses

558
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:39,367
and pieces that could fit
in the confines of a LC-130.

559
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,500
It's a fun job. And to support
the scientists is fantastic.

560
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:47,667
In just a few hours, we cross
the Ross Ice Shelf,

561
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,633
fly up the Beardmore Glacier

562
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:52,967
into the heart of Antarctica...
The Polar Plateau.

563
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,600
How many miles from McMurdo
to the Pole?

564
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:56,600
Around?

565
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,467
735 miles.

566
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,826
And Scott had to walk that?
What was going through his mind?

567
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:03,100
He loved to suffer.

568
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:04,733
The first explorers who got here

569
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,467
or came close raced

570
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,633
across the continent
striving to be the first.

571
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:11,900
Amundsen made it
before anyone in 1911,

572
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:14,900
beating Scott by only 34 days.

573
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:19,267
Amundsen wisely used huskies to
pull his sleds across the ice.

574
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,600
Scott didn't, and his team
never made it back alive.

575
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:29,167
The South Pole.
What you might not know

576
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,933
or be prepared for is,
the South Pole is high.

577
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:35,900
Like, 9,000 feet
above sea level.

578
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:38,567
And it's cold.
Real cold.

579
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,100
But you knew that.

580
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:44,267
You feel the altitude.

581
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,967
Today, the base at South Pole

582
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,167
has the feel of a space
station... a warm,

583
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,367
comfortable bubble in the middle
of, well, the great void.

584
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,833
It can be incredibly
harsh out there with winds

585
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,667
reaching as high as 50 knots

586
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,067
and temperatures regularly
dropping below -50° Fahrenheit.

587
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,300
About 200 scientists

588
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:06,233
and staff work here
during the summer season.

589
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:08,467
Some of the few freshies
I've got left.

590
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,333
Oh, really?
Chef Bryan Denham

591
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:13,100
is responsible for keeping them
all fed and happy.

592
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:15,467
He's been coming here
for about five seasons,

593
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,233
wintering over
for three of those.

594
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:20,867
Again, one makes a lot
with a little.

595
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,967
What do you think
a likely common thread

596
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,733
is between all of the people

597
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,533
who choose to come
to this place?

598
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:28,160
Everybody's got a spirit
of adventure here.

599
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,633
It's really cool
because you think,

600
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,367
"Oh, I've done some
pretty cool things,"

601
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,626
and then you talk
to someone else and you say,

602
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:33,733
"Oh, I've done nothing."

603
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,267
Dr. Stuart Jefferies

604
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,000
is an astronomer
and solar specialist.

605
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:38,467
First year, it's
for the adventure.

606
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,300
The second year,
it's for the money.

607
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,967
The third year is 'cause
you don't fit anywhere else.

608
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,433
You can't punch it
anywhere else.

609
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,133
That's right.

610
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,593
Siri Grossman runs
equipment and supply.

611
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,033
I really love it here.

612
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:50,260
I feel like I live
on a space station.

613
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,867
I keep coming back.

614
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,867
It's damn good.
Like after a hard day

615
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,067
of dragging blocks of ice,
this is exactly what you need.

616
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,733
Mm-hmm.
People that work outside,

617
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:02,933
I mean, they'll burn 5,000,
6,000 calories a day.

618
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:05,933
Generally speaking, people can
work between one and four hours

619
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,367
at a time before they need to...

620
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,033
- Come in and get warmed up.
- Yeah.

621
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,226
- Yeah.
- We eat pretty good down here

622
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:11,633
considering where we are.

623
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,400
We got a five-week menu cycle.

624
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:15,500
- Right.
- Every Friday for four weeks

625
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,133
is New York strips.

626
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,060
On the fifth week, we do
filet mignon and crab legs.

627
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:23,000
We don't really do fancy food.
We just basic food well.

628
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:24,226
You're doing filet mignon
with crab legs.

629
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,233
Eh, that's every five weeks.

630
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,160
Right. How do you deal with
vegetarians with no freshies?

631
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:30,433
We got lots of frozen
and canned stuff.

632
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:32,733
It's like justice.

633
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:33,933
Yeah.

634
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:35,600
Who determines the playlist?

635
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:38,533
It's usually whoever's shift
is going on at the time.

636
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:41,200
I think there was a complaint
one day about the music.

637
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,400
Then they picked this
really awful song the next day

638
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:45,333
and they played it over
and over and over.

639
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,600
It was "Afternoon Delight."
We just put it on loop.

640
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,433
We started listening
to German talk radio, too.

641
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,833
- German talk radio?
- Yeah.

642
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,567
So, what do you do here?

643
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,200
We look at the inside of
the sun through seismic probing.

644
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:58,333
No one's looking
for frozen Nazi cyborgs?

645
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:00,137
I think they get those
in the top few layers.

646
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,900
They're around here somewhere.
I'm sure of it.

647
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:12,467
Beneath the station
is a subterranean world.

648
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:15,933
♪

649
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,400
2,000 feet of tunnels
30 feet down.

650
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:31,167
Carved into the walls,

651
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,333
impromptu shrines
depicting personal messages,

652
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:38,133
remembrances left behind
by long-gone workers.

653
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,533
A frozen, constantly moving

654
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:43,567
and shifting network
of passageways...

655
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,567
The walls come in, the ceiling
comes down, the floor comes up.

656
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,533
Requiring constant maintenance.

657
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,000
What's supporting this roof?

658
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:51,267
Compaction of the snow.

659
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,133
Scott Smith runs the crews

660
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,633
keeping these tunnels
clear and pipes flowing.

661
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,567
We're in the process now
of picking the chainsaw

662
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,267
depth off the walls

663
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,367
and the ceiling to make it
into a more useable entry.

664
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,533
A lot of work.

665
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,600
Pretty amazing
feat of engineering here.

666
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:10,100
The lowest recorded temperature

667
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:13,100
at the South Pole is -117°.

668
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,933
We're roughly -59° right now.

669
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:16,700
59°.

670
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,767
- That's Fahrenheit.
- Wow. It only feels like -20°.

671
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,333
It's ish.

672
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:22,333
I can tell you it scorches

673
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,800
the lungs and creeps
through your heavy outerwear.

674
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:27,233
200 feet below the ground
we've melted a giant,

675
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:31,067
enormous lake down there,
about 2 million gallons.

676
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,700
This takes about 20
inches of snow

677
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:34,567
to make an inch of water.

678
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,360
Pump that fresh water
supply up to the station.

679
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:38,100
It gets treated
at the power plant.

680
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:39,733
- Yeah.
- The rest comes back down.

681
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,767
Recirculated as hot,
which then melts more ice.

682
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
- Right.
- There's a giant hole

683
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:48,200
in the ground that contains
our sewage for future removable.

684
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:51,033
Water on top,
sewer on the bottom.

685
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,433
What do they do down here?

686
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:16,433
Some pretty trippy shit,
as it turns out.

687
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:19,000
This is the Bicep
in the Dark Sector Lab

688
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:20,967
and the South Pole Telescope,

689
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,267
ten meters across, mapping
thousands of degrees of sky.

690
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,967
Today, they're installing

691
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,800
the most advanced camera
of its kind.

692
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,893
It's the third generation
South Pole Telescope camera.

693
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,533
16,000 pixels.

694
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:35,300
It weighs about 2,500 pounds.

695
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:38,433
In a couple days, we're gonna
pull it up into the telescope

696
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:41,333
and try and see if we can
hit the sky with it.

697
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:44,200
Very cool. It's like
a Bond villain stuff, you know.

698
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:45,567
Yeah, I know. That's right.

699
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:48,633
Astrophysicists like Dan Marrone

700
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,800
will be looking through
those telescopes at,

701
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,100
get this, Sagittarius A...

702
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:56,600
The freakin' black hole
at the center of the Milky Way.

703
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:58,326
We think we know what
black holes look like,

704
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,467
but no one's ever actually
looked at one,

705
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,133
and if you can build a telescope
the size of the entire Earth,

706
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,700
you can actually see
with enough resolution

707
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:07,200
to watch things swirling around

708
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:09,267
and disappearing
into the black hole.

709
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,333
We're basically taking
every similar telescope

710
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:13,833
in the world
to synthesize one telescope

711
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:16,000
that's 11,000 kilometers across.

712
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,867
Basically the size
of the entire Earth.

713
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,433
- Really?
- So that we can take a picture

714
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:22,193
of the black hole
at the center of our galaxy.

715
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,100
Wow. South Pole
particularly useful because?

716
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:27,667
There's no other site like this.

717
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,467
The atmosphere is
extremely stable.

718
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,200
It's extremely clear.
There's no water in it.

719
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:33,067
Water absorbs the microwaves
we're looking at.

720
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,300
So, you can just map the sky day

721
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,000
and night for six months a year

722
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:39,067
without stopping, and it
gives the best maps

723
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,300
we can make, short
of going into space.

724
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,000
I grew up in the Kennedy era

725
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:44,600
where the Space Program
was everything.

726
00:35:44,633 --> 00:35:46,600
The first men on the moon,
the space race,

727
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:50,000
the whole nation couldn't wait
'til we can get to Mars.

728
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:51,400
Nobody gives a
[...] now.

729
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:53,033
I mean, have you seen
that change?

730
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,767
Because, I felt it change.

731
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,533
Yeah. It's true that there
is an increased skepticism

732
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:01,067
of objective reality these days,

733
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,800
but this science stands

734
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:07,267
on thousands of years
of human accrued understanding.

735
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,433
Who's interested? Like,
who's most likely to benefit?

736
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:13,333
There's no immediate answer
to that question.

737
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:15,267
But you're asking
basic questions

738
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,667
about the fundamental nature
of matter, time, space.

739
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,867
Surely it was people asking
those kinds of questions

740
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,100
that led directly
to technologies

741
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,000
that we take for granted now.

742
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:28,687
That's right.
I mean, there's no question.

743
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,633
We have to solve hard problems
to do these things,

744
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:33,400
and when we solve them
they have other applications.

745
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:35,867
I've always thought
of this basic research...

746
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,500
Trying to understand
the universe...

747
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:40,733
As one of the most hopeful
things that humans do.

748
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:43,033
We just want to know.

749
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,233
What's at the other end of that?

750
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:48,167
Wouldn't you kind of like
to know?

751
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,333
At a time when science
is held in open contempt,

752
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,167

753
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,333

preconceived policies,

- How old is this?

Responsibly, of course.

You got it. You got it.

802
