To get education, yes.

366
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,486
It's the only way you get,
like, public education,

367
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,854
is to become a novice.

368
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,222
- Yes.
- Ah.

369
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,358
So everybody.
Everybody, yeah.

370
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,025
That's where you learn English.
Yeah.

371
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,861
- And you speak French too?
- No.

So what have we got here?

377
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,218
Aw lahm is
an incarnate Lao dish.

378
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:22,188
Wood ear mushrooms, dill.

379
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,691
The key ingredient
is the pepper wood,

380
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,359
these wooden blocks,

381
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,194
which has, like,
a white pepper, star anise...

382
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,062
That infuses the fish.
You don't eat it.

383
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,564
It's like an umami.

384
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,066
Very herbaceous, peppery,
really rich.

385
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,902
Unlike anything I've ever had.

386
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,371
We have two types of lahm.
One's raw. One's cooked.

387
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,407
So it's cooked buffalo,
raw buffalo.

388
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,041
- Buffalo.
- Man, it's really good.

389
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,977
This was kind of improvised.
Leuat paeng.

390
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,980
"Leuat paeng" translates
to "fixed blood."

391
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,450
So it's buffalo blood.

392
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,485
It's a really tricky way
to prepare the dish,

393
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,287
'cause you want
the blood to set,

394
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:57,390
so the way you do
is dilute the blood with water.

395
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,726
And just pour it over herbs,
and that's it.

396
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,329
Lao panna cotta.

397
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,163
Mmm, this is
really, really good.

398
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,765
You know, the balance
is so beautiful.

399
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:09,302
This meal kind of represents,
like, a Lao table.

400
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:11,170
You always got to have a soup.

401
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,773
You always got to have
some kind of lahm, a stew,

402
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,241
some kind of muddled salad,

403
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,909
sticky rice, of course,
and a dip.

404
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,345
- And Beerlao.
- And Beerlao.

405
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,012
Yeah, let's get that.
Let's get that.

406
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,259
Your parents left Laos in what?

407
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,094
- '81.
- '81.

408
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,664
And, you know, we migrated
to a community

409
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,332
of other Laotians.

410
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,200
And it was pretty much
a community like this.

411
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,995
We all shared water.
Scratching out a living.

412
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,771
I mean, if you were Laotian
and you wanted

413
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,106
to make money back then,
you were cooking Thai food.

414
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,968
Exactly. My mom worked
in Thai restaurants, and...

415
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,344
What does your mom think
of your Lao cooking?

416
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,112
She's just pretty impressed,
surprisingly.

417
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,381
The first thing she does

418
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,048
when she walks
through my kitchen is,

419
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,450
she goes to the waste bin,

420
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,152
and she goes looks in the trash
and goes...

421
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,654
"Why you throwing this out?"

422
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,055
Yeah, yeah.

423
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,958
You know, it's, like,
cilantro stems.

424
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,794
So how many years
were you a novice?

425
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:08,795
Three years.

426
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:09,862

- Yes.

427
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:10,997
Well, what's the minimum?

428
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,465
Ah, minimum seven days.

429
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,034
- Wow. That's easy.
- Easy.

430
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,469
I don't have time.

431
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,171
What's life like at the temple?

432
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,207
Sleep on the floor?
You sleep in a bed?

433
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,075
Normally, we sleep in the floor,

434
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,644
and later I sleep on bed.

435
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,546
- One meal a day.
- One meal a day.

436

from the almsgiving.

Yes, snack and drink:
coffee, Ovaltine.

Here's a cup.
