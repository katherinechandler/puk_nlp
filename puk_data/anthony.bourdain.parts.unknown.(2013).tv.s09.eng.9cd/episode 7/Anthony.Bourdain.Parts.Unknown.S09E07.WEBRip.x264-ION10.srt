It started in 1898,
more than 100 years ago.

363
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,344
Most of the Christians were
being persecuted by the Turks,

364
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:36,449
so there was an exodus
of Christians leaving Syria.

365
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,951
They boarded
the ships from Beirut,

366
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,355
and as long as it
was heading west,

367
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:46,293
they thought they were
going to America.

368
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,528
Many of our parents
landed in Trinidad,

369
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,497

- Look at... isn't this amazing?
- Beirut.

376

Oh, yes, like Beirut.
You know arak?

377
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,352
- I do indeed.
- Would you like arak?

378
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,686
A little ice and some water

379
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,322

Grey Goose and coconut water.

The family's story
is not an uncommon one.

382
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,562
The first members came here

383
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,964
during the collapse
of the Ottoman Empire,

384
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,699
arriving penniless.

385
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,402
They worked their way up
as textile merchants

386
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:31,571
and branched out
to run businesses that sell

387
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,474
everything from medical
equipment to real estate.

388
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,245
And how large is
the community now in Trinidad?

389
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,812
A little under 5,000.

390
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,815
That's still a fairly
small percentage of the...

391
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,251
Extremely small.

392
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:47,554
Actually, we are the smallest
ethnic group in Trinidad.

393
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,089
But the most powerful,
almost the most powerful.

394
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,691
Small but the
most powerful, huh?

395
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,326
That's not bragging.

396
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,598
Syrian-Lebanese merchant class
are generally seen as the elite.

397
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,433
Actually, I'm very big
in the food business.

398
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,369
I have a 120 restaurants.

399

I can't tell you how happy
I am about this meal.

401
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,411
I love, love the food.

402
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,615
This is raw kibbeh,

403
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,717
the best raw kibbeh
you'll ever eat in your life.

404
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,719
- Yeah.
- This is the fried version,

405
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,621
which is stuffed
with the nice stuffing,

406
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,424
and then we have
the typical hummus.

407
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,926
This is muhammara,
which is made from chili paste

408
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,530
and ground nuts,
the best muhammara in Trinidad.

409
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,432
Then we have falafel patties.

410
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,126
We have grilled wings
with garlic, which is...

411
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,468
Every Arab loves,

412
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,470
Fish in tahini sauce.

418
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,817
back in Lebanon or Syria
if at all?

419
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,085
- Not very much.
- We are Trinidadians too.

420
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,423
As much as we are Lebanese
and Syrian, we are Trinidadians.

421
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,626
Trinidad has been good to us,
and we know it.

422
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,428
But life is good here
in Trinidad.

423
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,829
Life is very good,

424
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,964
but there is a measure
of concern in the fact

425
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,635
that at one time we used
to have a huge middle class

426
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,770
which was a sort of a security

427
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,005
in terms
of any possible conflict

428
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,174
between the haves
and the have-not.

429
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,411
But now that's eroding,
and they're getting poorer,

430
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,780
so they're starting
to get angry.

431
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,850
What do you think
the biggest danger is right now?

432
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,518
Civil commotion.

433
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,186
- Yes.
- Civil commotion?

434
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,657
Yeah. We have a crime problem
related to gangs.

435
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,992
Gang warfare.
Related to gang warfare.

436
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,896
It ain't all good for
everybody here by a long shot.

437
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:45,872
Trinidad, with a population
of only 1.3 million people,

438
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:49,842
had 460 murders last year,
giving Port of Spain

439
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,545
a per capita murder rate
higher than Detroit,

440
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,014
Oakland, or Chicago.

Mark Bassant covers
the subjects of drug

442
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:01,220
and gang-related violence
as an investigative journalist.

443
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,890
People want you dead?

444
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,392
You could say that.

445
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,394
Who wants you dead,
do you think?

446
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,895
Well, two years ago I did

447
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,863
a piece about
the state prosecutor,

448
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,799
Dana Seetahal,
who was shot dead.

449
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,234
When state prosecutor
Dana Seetahal left

450
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,738
the Ma Pau car park just
before midnight on May 3rd,

451
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:22,008
she had no inclination it
would be her last moments alive.

452
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,211
When Mark began to look into
the murder of the prosecutor,

453
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,679
an informant told him

454
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,582
there was a $20,000 contract
on his life.

455
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,485
They had people following me
over a period of time,

456
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,721
some law enforcement officers
and so on,

457
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:38,425
so my company put me on a plane.

458
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,359
I went... I stayed
under an assumed name

459
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:44,363
for about three months in
a location outside of Trinidad.

460
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:48,935
Generally speaking, when
people like that want you dead,

461
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,937
they get you.

462
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,605
Why are you back?

463
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,341
I guess, to quote from a great

464
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,843
U.S. journalist,
Walter Cronkite,

465
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,578
"It's not what you
want people to know.

466
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,246
It's what they need to know."

467
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,949
We need to have people held
accountable for certain things.

468
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:08,020
With drug trafficking being one
of the biggest businesses

469
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,288
in the world,

470
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,525
Trinidad continues to be
a major transshipment point

471
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,060
for drug dealers

472
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:17,296
to get that product out
to North America

473
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,931
and to Europe,

474
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:22,134
so you find now
the explosion of violence

475
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,136
that we have is for those

476
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,774
that are involved locally
with the drug trafficking,

477
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,642
this fight for territory.

478
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:33,546
An estimated $3.5 billion
worth of narcotics

479
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,882
moves through
the Caribbean each year.

480
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,817
Trinidad's porous borders,

481
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,419
busy port,
proximity to Venezuela,

482
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:43,155
and the inevitable corruption
that comes with numbers

483
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,124
and threats like that make it,

484
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:48,628
unfortunately,
an ideal transshipment point.

485
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:54,501
How bad is high-level
corruption alleged to be?

486
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:57,136
Fairly deep.
I think that the complicity

487
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,607
comes across the law
enforcement agencies,

488
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,578
customs, police officers,
even at higher levels.

489
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,848
And with corruption,
poverty, hopelessness,

490
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,917
add some radical ideology
to that,

491
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,853
and Trinidad has proved
relatively fertile ground

492
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:17,189
for the recruitment
of ISIS fighters...

493
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:18,791
and terrorists.

494
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:21,761

Trinidadian nationals

495
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,131
being one of the highest
in the region going to Syria,

496

and it's over a hundred

497

calling from ISIS

499

his music calls

535
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,901

You look around
my city right now,

545
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,356
and a lot of young people
are choosing death over life

546
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,058
because the life that they look
at doesn't feel like

547
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,633
it's substantiated by anything.

548
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,036
In the Freetown neighborhood
now called Belmont,

549
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:20,539
he lives with his
81-year-old granny, Neela Natu.

550
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,509
The thing is that recently
we've had a lot of people,

551
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,377
people who I've known,
who I grew up with

552
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:28,114
who've gone to fight in Syria,
who've left here.

553
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,517
I mean, they will tell you
that the official count is 140.

554
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,219
I would say it's more.

555
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,021
- You'd say it's more?
- I'd say it's more.

556
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,556
And why do you think
people would go?

557
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,791
I'd have to go back into

558
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,392
my childhood
to explain that to you.

559
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:41,728
The coup that happened here

560
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,395
happened when
I was six years old.

561
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,032
They had all these young people
in there who had this idea,

562
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,592
you know, we're going
to build this thing.

563
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,061
There's this community
that's gonna stand up

564
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:50,502
against what's going on
in Trinidad,

565
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,404
that's going to stand up
against the drugs

566
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:53,906
and stand up against poverty

567
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,709
and stand up against crime,
and nothing happened.

568
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:59,011
In none of these causes,

569
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:03,916
religious fundamentalism
or fervor has not come up.

570
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,218
You... every... every issue
you've mentioned so far

571
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,721
has been perceived
inadequacy of social justice.

572
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:09,922
Right, yeah.

573
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:12,759
So these kids
going off to Syria,

574
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,360
do they have any idea
what they're doing?

575
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,188
- No, they do not.
- Or are they just pissed off?

576
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,931
No, they do not. People say
that poverty breeds crime.

577
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:20,625
I don't think poverty
breeds crime in a sense.

578
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:24,370
I think exclusion breeds crime
because if I truly care for you,

579
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,539
if I feel like you are a part
of the thing that I exist in,

580
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,341
then I won't... I won't hurt you.

581
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,077
Might come in your house
and steal some food,

582
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,912
but when you see
that kind of violence

583
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,713
being enacted,
you have to ask yourself.

584
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:36,115
It's not just somebody saying,

585
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,709
"I need this tablecloth.
I'm gonna take this."

586
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,286
No, "I want this tablecloth",

587
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,621
"and you, you had this
tablecloth for too long,

588
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,483
"so you know what,
I'm gonna take this out on you.

589
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,558
This is gonna happen.
That's gonna happen."

590
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,360
And that's what
we're seeing now.

591
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,241
I mean, how long can people
put up with something

592
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:53,399
before they decide this is
enough, you know what I mean?

593
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:56,435
Would you say that Carnival
and that Carnival attitude,

594
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,206
the liming culture is a...

595
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:04,410
Might as well be a brilliant
strategy to narcotize

596
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:07,446
the people into being satisfied
with the status quo?

597
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:13,219
Everything here is somehow
designed to...

598
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,122
pacify it
without us really realizing,

599
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:19,758
so our music, which is
supposed to give us adrenaline

600
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,293
as well as sleeping pills
sometimes,

601
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,995
it's just doling
out sleeping pills.

602
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:25,097
Like, go ahead, enjoy yourself.
Enjoy yourself.

603
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:26,432
Enjoy yourself.
You are Trini.

604
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,901
Trini means fun-loving and happy

605
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,070
and whatever
despite whatever it is.

606
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:31,938
Ah.

607
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:39,478
It's a big and delicious
home-cooked meal.

608
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,339
I caught this myself.

609
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,081
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

610
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,283
- Red snapper?
- Yeah, yeah.

611
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,185
The snapper is seasoned
with lime juice,

612
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,121
shado beni and onion.

613
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:51,290
What's this dish called?
Is there a name for it?

614
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,192
- This is called oil down.
- Oil down?

615
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,526
- Yeah.
- For oil down

616
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,962
they season breadfruit

617
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:58,030
and meat with dasheen
and green figs,

618
00:29:58,064 --> 00:30:00,366
then simmer in coconut milk.

619
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,501
And, well, she uses pork,
as you can see,

620
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,204
which I... now I can't have any,
so that's okay.

621
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,139
Now your grandma, not a Muslim?

622
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:11,377
No, the Roman Catholic-est
of all Roman Catholics.

623
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,146
- Old-school?
- Sacred heart up on the wall.

624
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,116
I got a kind of a perfect one
for you, so you have this.

625
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,118
- Oh, beautiful, thank you.
- Pastel.

626
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,488
This is mostly when
the Spaniards where here,

627
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,556
introduced this.
This is a Spanish one.

628
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,227
Pastels are the Caribbean
cousin to the tamale.

629
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,329
Minced beef is wrapped
in cornmeal dough,

630
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,799
then in banana leaf,
then steamed.

631
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,401
Table for sure.

632
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,904
She will feed you till
you burst like any grandmother.

633
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,671
You know, right?
Yeah.

634
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:42,208
- I'll be well looked after.
- And that is once a year.

635
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,210
- So when do these ordinarily...
- Christmastime.

636
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,578
Christmas, oh.
This is very, very delicious.

637
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,714
Thank you very much,
and one thing I've asked about.

638
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,349
Why you didn't put ice
in his glass?

639
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,051
It's good.
It's fine.

640
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,053
So he must say thanks
to whatever you made.

641
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,754
Tell Muhammad it's not good.

642
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,725
See how... see how
that generation, very proper,

643
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,427
like, very, very proper,

644
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,896
and one of the things
about Trinidad is that...

645
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,497
Muhammad, don't bad-talk me.

646
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,567
I'm not bad-talking you.
I only speak the truth.

647
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,905
That generation very much
believed in independence

648
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,606
and that this nation
would be something,

649
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,108
and then they told
their children,

650
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:18,244
"Study and come
and help this nation.

651
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,279
Build this nation,
and it's gonna be something."

652
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,781
And that generation, which was
my parents, they did that.

653
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,116
Right.

654
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,286
And then they had kids,
you know?

655
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,755
And all of a sudden it was like,
okay, all these things

656
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,058
you have been saying about
building a nation and whatever,

657
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,153
how come I'm seeing these people
benefitting, and I'm not?

658
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,155
How come I'm seeing this, I'm
seeing that, I'm seeing that?

659
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,990
And there were very few answers,
you know what I mean?

660
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,465
So who runs this country?

661
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:42,101
Like everywhere else, that 1%.
Like everywhere else.

662
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,971
Everybody here
is very eager to tell you

663
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,139
what a wonderful mix it is,

664
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:49,241
and the food, if you look at it,

665
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:52,778
it does... is this incredibly
harmonious stew pot.

666
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,246
Right.

667
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,248
But I guess life
doesn't work as well as food.

668
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,250
No. The only thing
we've agreed on in this place

669
00:31:58,284 --> 00:31:59,718
is how much salt
to put in anything.

670
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,321
So that's the only thing
we've agreed on.

before you start packing
your Speedo

679
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:38,657
and your cocoa butter,
is an industrial island.

680
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,330
And like so many places,

681
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:47,933
industrialization
is changing the landscape here,

682
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,202
but some things persist,

683
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:53,539
remain, echo from
all the way back then...

684
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,549
When West African slaves
would covertly do this,

685
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,351
Calinda.

686
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:08,020
This martial art,
based on our research,

687
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:10,989
is maybe 500, 600 years old.

688
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,558
Stick fighting variations

689
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,393
occur throughout the Caribbean,

690
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,329
but in Trinidad and Tobago it's,
like, deep in their blood.

691
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,803
This martial art was illegal
for many, many years.

692
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,338
Yes?
Yeah.

693
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:28,433
I mean, certainly during
slavery times it was illegal.

694
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,376
To this day,
I believe there's still laws

695
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:33,011
on our books
that ban this stick,

696
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:34,980
and if you're caught with it,
you could go to jail.

697
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,084
The laws of slavery times
forced this sport underground.
