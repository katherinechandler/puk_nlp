is all too often.

90
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,167
Now, generally speaking,

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,333
to open up a cart on the street,
you need a license?

92
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,567
You have to have a license
for yourself,

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,900
and then you have to have
a permit for the cart itself.

94
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:37,967
That's the problem.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,167
And any spot?

96
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,367
Generally speaking, yes,

97

"cleaning up" Roosevelt Avenue.

109
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,900
You know what that means.

110
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,233
If you get higher rent,
nicer buildings,

111
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:12,700
they're not gonna want
a street cart out in front.

That's sometimes the problems
that vendors face.

113
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,400
Even if the spot
is completely legal,

114
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:19,400

where there's building managers

115
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,726

so good at home,

of a typical class in school?

212
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,926
My high school
was a public high school,

213
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:06,500

East and South Asian,

214
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,333

if the American dream is alive,

00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:18,467
I think it's alive

as an open place,

00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:35,367
I think in a place with so much
race and diversity,

227
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,633
it gets in the way less here
than it does in other places.

228
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:42,167
Will America as a whole look
sooner or later like Queens?

was still mostly farmland

The Neir family, German émigrés,

a ballroom, and a hotel

in 1898

Neir's Social Hall.

came together who lived here,

where the city

608

and Robert Moses in particular

609
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:09,967
really used as, like, a dumping
ground for undesirable groups

610
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
that the city didn't necessarily
want to deal with.

611
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:14,200
Back in the day,
the Rockaways were

612
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:16,867
a summer destination
for middle-class New Yorkers

613
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,533
until better roads
and an improved rail system

614
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:23,033
lured them to the beaches
of Long Island.

615
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:26,033
They threw a bunch of
public housing projects in here.

616
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:28,200
They sent a lot of the
low-income people of the city

617
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,967
out here,
and it just wasn't a place

618
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,333
that historically
the city ever took seriously.

619
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,033
You know, since then,
we've always had

620
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:36,533
a lot of working-class whites
move in,

621
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:38,200
into more kind of
the western end,

622
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:40,467
and so you've kind of seen
in the Rockaways

623
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,567
just kind of shape out
along race and class lines.

624
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,867
And the one dynamic
that's changed after Sandy

625
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,367
was that a lot more, like,
young urban professional types,

626
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,993
like, were really coming out
here, you know,

627
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,367

intentionally or not

628
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,567

Brooklynify the Rockaways.

629
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,367
Right.

630

631
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:58,067
Rockaway's called,
like, the Brooklyn Riviera

632
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,333

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,000
gonna leave you behind.
