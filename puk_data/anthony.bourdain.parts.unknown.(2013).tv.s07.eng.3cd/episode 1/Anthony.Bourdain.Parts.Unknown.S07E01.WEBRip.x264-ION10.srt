martial art, Kali

364
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,338
is among the most brutal,
the most remorseless

365
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,298
defense systems going.

366
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,552
It was developed to deal with
some very harsh realities

367
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:05,431
and a very tough,
very bloody history.

368
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:11,145
Three centuries of brutal
Spanish colonial rule.

369
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,774
Invasion by the Japanese.

370
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,611
Near the end of World War II,
American forces bombed Manila,

371
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,321
pretty much leveling the city.

372
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,440
Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos'

373
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:26,535
extravagantly corrupt
regime, martial law.

374
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,710
Although the Philippines
has remained

375
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:39,339
a democracy since then, it
can seem, at times, fragile.

376
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,349
Merry Christmas, everybody.

377
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,102
Merry Christmas.

378
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,709
Cheers.

379
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,189
Cheers.

380
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,233
Now, you both are
photojournalists?

381
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,358
Yeah.

382
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,359
Based out of Manila?

383
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,465
Yeah, me.

384
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:01,528
Mark lives in Mindanao.

385
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,467
Mindanao?

386
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:03,363
Mindanao, yep.

387
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,825
Now, does a journalist
need to carry

388
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,619
a firearm in this country?

389
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,454
For me, yes.

390
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,963
In the Philippines, a press
badge is no defense,

391
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,589
particularly in the
south of the country,

392
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,383
where Mark Navales
lives and works.

393
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,470
Mindanao has been war-torn
for the last how many years?

394
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,973
Because of the radicalization
of recent years,

395
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,706
this growing specter of
ISIS, Mindanao is a fertile

396
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:33,978
ground for that.

397
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,063
Now, traditionally,
the argument against

398
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,565
journalists arming themselves
is that journalists

399
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,985
have always been able
to portray themselves

400
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,508
as non-combatants.

401
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:43,988
Yes.

402
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,011
There was some presumption -that
they would not shoot you.

403
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:48,408
Yeah.

404
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,411
But these days, people seem
to not make that distinction.

405
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,208
Yes, dating back to the
Marcos years, even, yeah.

406
00:22:55,249 --> 00:23:00,420
Since 1992, 77
journalists were killed.

407
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,423
Politics here can be deadly.

408
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,427
Just before Christmas in 2009,
the Maguindanao Massacre

409
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,890
claimed the lives of 58
people, dozens of whom

410
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,225
were journalists.

411
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,476
It was the single
deadliest event

412
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,687
for journalists in history.

413
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,940
Mark was the first one on
the scene with a camera.

414
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,942
There is no system of justice.

415
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,320
There is no government
attending to your needs.

416
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,155
Nobody's coming to save you.

417
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:27,532
Is that what you're saying?

418
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:28,866
No one's coming to save you.

419
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,163
You know, I have... I
have my family.

420
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,227
I have my small kids.

421
00:23:35,228 --> 00:23:36,249
Yeah.

422
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,754
For me, my last... recourse
there is to defend myself.

423
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,881
Look, it's very much a
do-it-yourself culture.

424
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,259
You can see that. You can
see it in people's homes,

425
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,553
the way they just stacked
one on top of each other,

426
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,471
built out using spare
bits of metal.

427
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,508
And it's like, "Nobody else
is gonna give it for me."

428
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,245
I'll build it."

429
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:54,975
Right.

430
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,352
"I'll make it myself."

431
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,937
Right.

432
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,521
There's a lot of
poverty in this city.

433
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,481
That is for sure.

434
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:05,319
But there's not a sense
of hopelessness or rage.

435
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,904
You know, they decorate.

436
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,198
You know, they may not have
much, but they decorate.

437
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,304
They sweep the street.

438
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:12,868
There's still a sense
of humble ownership

439
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,703
in the sense of,
"This is my home,"

440
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,290
and it's going to be safe.

441
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,333
"It's going to be fine."

442
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,507

in a lunch, assuming
correctly as it turned out

485
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,074
that one of these young
punks would know

486
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:19,054
how to make a good adobo.

487
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,871
Is there a single authentic
adobo recipe, or does everybody

488
00:27:22,872 --> 00:27:24,143
do it differently?

489
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,686
Everyone would stake claim
to having the best adobo,

490
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,648
but the basic ingredients, I
think, will remain the same.

491
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,363
So it's garlic, pork.

492
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,158
We can now add the chicken.

493
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:44,913
Vinegar, peppercorns,
bay leaf, soy sauce.

494
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,375
Mmm, this adobo is amazing.

495
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,709
It's really, really good.

496
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,170
- Oh, man.
- Thank you. Thank you.

497
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,754
And where did you
learn to cook adobo?

498
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,965
I learned this from my mom.

499
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:59,094
So the answer, as always, to
who makes the best adobo is,

500
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,180
mom makes the... okay.

501
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,799
That would be... that would
be the safest answer.

502
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,266
All right.

503
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,725
Mom.

504
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,603
Filipinos like feeding people.

505
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:08,728
Yes, yes.

506
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,607
What else do Filipinos like?

507
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:12,691
Filipinos are hospitable.

508
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:13,733

00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,980
- Everybody knows how to sing.
- Everybody knows how to sing.

511
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,406
They don't necessarily
have to be in tune,

512
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,220
but they wanna sing;

513
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:20,991
they like to sing.

514
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,369

to music from, like,

515
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,744
from a very young age.

516
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,602
I'm the drummer for the
band, but I'm not actually

517
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:28,582
formally trained.

518
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,993
Up to this day, I don't
even read notes.

519
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,876
Uh-hmm.

520
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,773
But, um... I could
memorize a song.

521
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:35,673
If you gave it to
me, like, in a day,

522
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,673
I could play the whole thing.

523
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,791
Well, that's pretty
much the stakes.

524
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,676
- You have to, right? I mean...
- Yeah.

525
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,469

526

Well, hopefully, we
get... we get to play

for a bigger crowd, you
know, 'cause I think

532
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,193

actually getting more people
