1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:08,575
Some time ago, something
crawled or slithered or grew

2
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,043
like a fungus.

3
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:12,445
Something that started small,

4
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,981
got bigger, lurched like a swamp

5
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:17,050
thing out of the mud and moist

6
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,152
earth and humid
nights of the delta.

7
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,289
Then it took over the world.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:30,290
So next time some smartass
horrified by our ham-fisted

9
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,398
foreign policy wonders what good

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,599
is America, well, you can always

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,934
pipe up that the blues, rock and

12
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:39,239
roll, R & B, and soul all
came out of this place.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,310
One state, Mississippi.

14
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:51,118

00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,321

♪

23
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:44,671
Right now we're in the
middle of downtown Jackson.

24
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:45,072
Parrish street.

25
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:46,173
A lot of history.

26
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:47,840
What did it used to be
like back in the day?

27
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,242
The street was
packed with folks.

28
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:49,910
Folks all over.

29
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:52,812
They had their own restaurants,

30
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,882
grocery stores, joints, I mean,

31
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:56,550
everything happened here that

32
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:58,685
happened in Jackson for the
African-American community.

33
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,753
The state capital of Jackson,

34
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:04,691
Mississippi, located along
interstate highway 55, just

35
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:07,527
outside what's known as
the Mississippi delta.

36
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:08,761
It's the kind of place that

37
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,499
makes you wonder why did
they make it the capital.

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,904
Until you grab hold of what
used to be around here.

39
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,105
Farris street used to be the hub

40
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,007
of African-American
life in this city.

41
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,075
Its black commercial cultural

42
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:27,947
center, when Dr. King came
to town he came here.

43
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,849
Everybody did.

44
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,885
Medger Evers had a
house upstairs here.

45
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,054
Musicians like Tommy Johnson,

46
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,089
Sonny boy Williamson, too, and

47
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,191
Elmore James all played here and

48
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:41,794
the likes of Duke Ellington, cab

49
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,464
Callaway, count Basie and Louie

50
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:45,366
Armstrong took the stage at

51
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,200
places like the crystal palace

52
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:50,870
ballroom and the Alamo
on Farris street.

53
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,372
What happened?

54
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:53,039
Where did it all go?

55
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,977
What killed it was immigration.

56
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,546
Once we were able to break out

57
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:00,147
of our indigenous black owned

58
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:00,948
businesses, the businesses died.

59
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:01,949
Great for the black race but

60
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,216
terrible for the black business.

61
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,618
In fact, the only reason you're

62
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,886
coming here right now is you

63
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,821
have two churches, two funeral

64
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,056
homes and the big apple inn.

65
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,758
You will either die, worship or

66
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,925
come to my place to eat.

67
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,628
That's the only... or all three.

68
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:22,902
Not in that order.

69
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,504
How you doing today?

70
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:30,910
Back when things were
hopping, Geno Lee's great

71
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:31,545
grandfather moved to Mississippi

72
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,246
from Mexico City, started a

73
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,681
family with an African-American
woman in Jackson.

74
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:37,517
He sold hot tamales out of a
steel drum on the corner.

75
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:42,188
In 1939, he moved the
operation inside, right here.

76
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:48,127
Now, the last restaurant
on the street.

77
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,829
Lurking inside, waiting for us,

78
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,599
is John T. Edge, who leads the

79
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,467
Southern food ways alliance.

80
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:55,001
Mr. Edge, how you doing?

81
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,869
Who makes a point, a mission,

82
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,505
out of knowing and teaching as

83
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,206
much as he can about the real

84
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,808
culinary traditions of the

85
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,010
south, and doing what he can to

86
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:10,717
keep them alive and unmolested.

87
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:11,718
Look at that.

88
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,353
Awesome.

89
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:14,621
It's like a cream sandwich.

90
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:18,190
What you go for here are smokes,

91
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,192
smoked sausage sandwiches and

92
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,228
these magnificent beauties, pig

93
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,496
ear sandwiches called ears, both

94
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,165
pretty much served with the same

95
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,402
garnish of slaw, mustard,
home-made hot sauce on a soft

96
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:29,970
bun.

97
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,804
As I understand it, originally

98
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,739
this is one of those nobody

99
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,341
wants these things,
they're dirt cheap.

100
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:35,708
Exactly right.

101
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,644
In fact, by dirt cheap, the ears

102
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,879
were actually free when my great

103
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,814
grandfather started getting the

104
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:42,181
pig ears, the butcher was giving

105
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,385
them to him because he would
just throw them away.

106
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,986
So everything we love about

107
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,921
pig, the texture, the mix of

108
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,558
fatty and lean, all
that, all that's good.

109
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:51,725
Mm.

110
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,494
Man.

111
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,562
That is hard to beat.

112
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:56,497
Isn't it good?

113
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,030
Um-hum.

114
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,399
It's a good sandwich.

115
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,401
Of course, some hot tamales

116
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,169
which at this point in history

117
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,071
are about as Mississippi
as they are Mexican.

118
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,406
Like the blues, they came out of

119
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,207
Mississippi in the early 20th

120
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,678
century as Mexican migrant
workers came in to replace

121
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,013
African-Americans, who were
headed to work in the great

122
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:17,684
factories and stockyards
of Chicago and Detroit.

123
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:21,354
Sitting down here, eating

124
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,856
tamales, we can sketch a
history of Mississippi.

125
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,425
That's kind of what I'm most

126
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,193
interested in doing, helping

127
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,061
southerners understand that

128
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,462
their foods are as African as

129
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:32,865
they are western European.

130
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,967
And hopefully... if not largely,

131
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,569
you know, music and all the

132
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,204
other cultural expressions
of the south.

133
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,772
I think food is a sneaky way of

134
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:40,907
getting at some of the serious

135
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,809
stuff we've been talking about.

136
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,043
I told you before, I didn't know

137
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,578
what a cool job or what a cool

138
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,481
restaurant I had until
you showed it to me.

139
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:49,916
I'm just making a living.

140
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,784
Just like a lot of folks
around Mississippi.

141
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,453
We're not trying
to make history.

142
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,488
We're not trying to
increase tourism.

143
00:05:55,489 --> 00:06:00,059
All we're doing is
doing what we do.

144
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,729
There is a discomfort level

145
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,797
about exploring Southern food

146
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,332
race or particularly Mississippi

147
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,234
food race when you're talking

148
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:08,300
about high end traditional

149
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,069
Southern cooking, you're talking

150
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,071
plantation slavery cooking
because that's where these

151
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:12,773
recipes came from.

152
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:14,607
So to revel in that, you don't

153
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,910
want to tumble into nostalgia.

154
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:21,414
The potential for awkwardness
and offense is enormous.

155
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:22,482
I want to be careful.

156
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,684
I'm not saying that's what
I want the south to be.

157
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,085
I'm saying that's what people

158
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:26,687
come to the south looking for.

159
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:28,421
Right.

160
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:32,258
They come to the south looking
for the past preserved

161
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:38,097
but the reality is
something different.

162
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,832
I want it to
progress and change.

163
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,100
I want to document the change

164
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,136
along the way and
celebrate that change.

165
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,606
The burden of race is upon
us and we must shake it.

166
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:54,607
That can make us better.

167
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,185
I'm a Yankee, so for me, it's

168
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,621
kind of shocking
to see this flag.

169
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:05,124
It means a lot of things
to a lot of people.

170
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,292
First and foremost meaning I'm

171
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:11,464
not a Yankee and I don't
much care what you think.

172
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,132
There's no doubt that much of

173
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,701
Mississippi history is ugly,

174
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:17,470
from slavery which was pretty
much the backbone, the

175
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,638
foundation of industry here from

176
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,244
the get-go, to Jim crow,
lynchings to church burnings.

177
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,146
14-year-old Emmett till, killed

178
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:30,817
for talking sass to a
white lady in 1955.

179
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:34,987
The assassination of
Medgar Evers in 1963.

180
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,489
The murders of civil rights

181
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,226
workers James Cheney, Michael

182
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,361
Schweren and Michael
Goodman in 1964.

183
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:47,333
They had to send in 30,000

the food was, white people

416
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,202
started coming which led to a

It was under water.

433
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,532
You had to be crazy to come and

434
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,733
you had to have enough money to

435
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:58,937

some sort of gamblers.

That spirit still
infuses the place.

437
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,742

438
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,577
sophisticated because they
all come from elsewhere.

439
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,879
You know, you go from the delta

440
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,382

441
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,417

442
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,418

458
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,985
flow of work, well, I gave up

459

460

hell out of Mississippi.

510
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,711
And there were a lot of reasons

He's been running this place,
senator's place, for 11.

529
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,989
What's the difference between
soul food and Southern,

530
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,558
traditional Southern food?

531
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,159
It depends on the culture and

532
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
what neighborhood you were in.

533
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:46,465
If you were in the black
neighborhood, it became soul.

534
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,333
We probably put a little bit

535
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:50,602
more of the throwaway in our

536
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,405
cooking, the pig feet, the pig

537
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,974
tail, the neck bones and
all of that's fatty.

538
00:22:55,975 --> 00:23:03,975
Now you're making me hungry.

539
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,353
So Greens... collard Greens.

540
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,821
Have some of that, for sure.

541
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:10,922
Is that fried okra there?

542
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,959
I'll have a little of that.

543
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,194
Might need more than one
plate at this rate.

544
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:19,164
Let me get some Mac and cheese.

545
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:22,100
What's that, Lima beans?

546
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:22,869
The red bean.

547
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,503
Oh, man, that looks
kind of good, too.

548
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,337
Yeah, little bit of that.

549
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,206
Neck bones floating
around somewhere?

550
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:28,441
Okay.

551
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:30,175
Yeah, I'll have some of those.

552
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,043
Little rice and gravy
on there, yeah.

553
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:35,881
Thanks.

554
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,183
And oh, a piece of
fried chicken there.

555
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:41,319
If you got a thigh,
that would be great.

556
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,688
Okra's perfect.

557
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:44,289
Yeah, it is.

558
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,624
Man, that's good.

559
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,626
Now here in the south, if you

560
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:50,896
want to, you can throw
your fork away and...

561
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:55,534
I'll be working on that.

562
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:59,404
We forgive you and don't
hold it against you.

563
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:03,141
Could eat this okra
all day long, man.

564
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:03,576
It's good.

565
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:05,911
I don't know what you
think about those Greens.

566
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:08,079
They're nice.

567
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,015
That's tasty.

568
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,182
This is the way people get the

569
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,251
credit for Southern
cooking as we know it.

570
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:13,820
I do.

571
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:16,254
You think the right
people get the credit?

572
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,255
People know.

573
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,423
People know who's behind this

574
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:19,491
food, whether it's called soul

575
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:22,861
food or whether it's
called country cooking.

576
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:27,032
How is the detail, the mindset
of the delta, different

577
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:28,166
than the rest of the state?

578
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:33,404
Nobody else can compare with us.

579
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,773
They have no one who can sit on

580
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:39,611
top of you and tell you they

581
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:43,348
represent dockery plantation
where the blues were born.

582
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,283
There's no one else that can

583
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:49,287
tell you his district is the

584
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:55,694
home of B.B. King, where
Jared Butler was born.

585
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,228
Or the staples singers.

586
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,130
When we talk about the heritage

587
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,298
and the culture and what comes

588
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,101
out of the delta, that's all

589
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:06,805
within this district
that I represent.

590
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:14,806
So Mississippi delta
has that pride.

591
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:21,486
46 miles southeast is
greenwood, a town with a lot of

592
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:25,791
history, most of it of
the not good variety.

593
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,560
Known unfortunately as much for

594
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,095
Tom Brady's infamous speech

595
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,429
after brown versus the board of

596
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,998
education as anything else,

597
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:36,467
fairly or not, it's
hard to get past that.

598
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,503
During all the years of cruelty

599
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:41,573
and struggle from 1933 on,

600
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:44,409
through it all, and until today,

601
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,680
this place, Lusco's, was
a beloved institution.

602
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,181
Once a grocery store it turned

603
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:53,685
restaurant to the moneyed class,

604
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:54,986
served them in discreet quarters

605
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,755
in the pack where one could

606
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:57,756
enjoy an alcoholic beverage in

607
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,257
what was then a dry state.

608
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,861
Still going after all
these years, unchanged.

609
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:03,029
Why?

610
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:08,466
This place is like a rel
quarter of indiscretions past,

611
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,101
you know?

612
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:10,969
But maybe to really tell the

613
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,437
story of this place, you have to

614
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:15,040
start with a story of its most

615
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,541
famous employee, Booker Wright.

616
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,611
He had been working at Lusco's

617
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:24,783
as a waiter since he
was 14 years old.

618
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,017
I'll be glad to tell you what

619
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:26,986
they're going to serve tonight.

620
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:31,723
In 1965, NBC news came to
town, making a documentary on

621
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,558
race relations.

622
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,660
Booker's entertaining recitation

623
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:37,062
of the menu at Lusco's was

624
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:38,229
famous around town so they asked

625
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:45,237
him to do his usual
routine for the camera.

626
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,074
But at the end of his usual

627
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,241
litany is where he dropped the

628
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:55,546
truth bomb that
nobody was ready for.

629
00:26:55,547 --> 00:27:00,853
Right here.

630
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:08,661
You have to smile.

631
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:10,729
If you don't, what's
wrong with you?

632
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,198
The meaner the man be,
the more you smile.

633
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:16,768
Although you're
crying on the inside.

634
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,203
You don't look for no tips.

635
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,537
Yes, sir, thank you.

636
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,272
What did you say?

637
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:21,941
Thank you, sir.

638
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:23,441
That's what you have to go

639
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:29,114
through here but
remember, keep smiling.

640
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:33,618
Telling the truth was still
risky business in 1966

641
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:34,786
Mississippi and Booker Wright

642
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,756
was not rewarded for his candor.

643
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,958
It was not a good
experience for him.

644
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,359
It did not make him a star.

645
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:48,433
Not within the white community
but even though black

646
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,467
power was first chanted here,

647
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:50,568
that was less important to the

648
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,437
black community here than what

649
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:52,138
Booker said on the NBC news.

650
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:55,640
Yeah.

651
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:58,543
The private dining rooms
at Lusco's is still here.

652
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:02,247
The menu, much the same.

653
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,949
Steaks, fish.

654
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,216
The famous broiled shrimp.

655
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,118
The Lusco special salad with the

656
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,954
house Italian vinaigrette

657
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:14,926
dressing and a healthy dose
of anchovie, onion rings.

658
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:15,994
Salad makes me happy.

659
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,929
Me, too.

660
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,598
Mostly anchovies make me happy.

661
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,833
Yeah, yeah, love those.

662
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:26,237
Catfish for Mr. Edge, the
famous pompano for me.

663
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,338
It's kind of the Mark of

664
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,507
being a great restaurant in the

665
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,176
delta if you have pompano.

666
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,078
Big damn fish.

667
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,813
No way I'm finishing this.

668
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:37,749
Sitting here, the booth, the

669
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,084
curtains, the whole ring bell

670
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:42,687
for service thing, it
seems lost in time.

671
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,455
We got a long ugly history

672
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,656
but that's one of the things I

673
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,792
love about this place, you can't

674
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:48,193
deny the burden of the past.

675
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:48,761
It gets on your shoulder.

676
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:51,129
It's right there.

677
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:57,769
America chooses to deny its
problems in many ways.

678
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,206
It declares itself a
post-racial society.

679
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:19,117
Oxford, Mississippi is a
lovely, eccentric island, a

680
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,227
magnet for writers, thinkers and

681
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:23,862
oddballs, drawn perhaps by its

682
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,864
rich literary tradition as the

683
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:29,500
home of one of our greatest
authors, William Faulkner.

684
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:33,571
Faulkner was a Mississippi
native, a former postman, an

685
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:34,572
outdoorsman and eventual winner

686
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:39,077
of the Nobel prize in literature

687
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:42,881
and two Pulitzer
prizes for fiction.

688
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:43,850
He never graduated high school.

689
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:46,051
This was his house, Roanoke.

690
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:48,186
Faulkner wrote such American

691
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:48,988
classics as the sound and the

692
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:52,223
fury, as I lay dying, light in

693
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:55,593
August and many of his works
took place in a fictional

694
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:56,694
county, a place very much like

695
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,930
this place, in Mississippi.

696
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:02,500
This is where Faulkner started
his writing career, in

697
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,269
this room here.

698
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,737
For the past ten years, bill

699
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:10,675
Griffith has been curator
at Faulkner’s estate.

700
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,844
After he won the Nobel prize,

701
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:17,715
on the wall here is an outline
of one of his novels.

702
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,350
That was his greatest book.

703
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,920
Faulkner thought that
was his masterpiece.

704
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:24,122
Jack Pendarvis is the author

705
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,858
of your body is changing, the
mysterious secret of the

706
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,126
valuable treasure and awesome as

707
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,028
well as a staff writer for the

708
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,630
game-changing animated
series adventure time.

709
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:36,534
All works of which
I am a huge fan.

710
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,568
He wrote right on the wall?

711
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,470
He wrote on it.

712
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:40,071
It's his man-cave.

713
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,606
It's his version.

714
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:42,974
He said houses in Mississippi

715
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,375
who have a family business have

716
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,743
one room dedicated to the family

717
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:48,379
business and this family's
business is writing.

718
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,048
From as early as 1919 through

719
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,583
the early '60s, Faulkner wrote

720
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,552
extensively about the
post-civil war south.

721
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,821
He was the first author to do

722
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:58,289
so, at a time when most writers

723
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:02,627
were writing about anything but.

724
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:06,097
He always said that he wrote
about a south torn between

725
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:07,298
itself, torn between the old

726
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:11,002
ways, the old traditional
ways and modern.

727
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:13,504
He said he would break
the code and he did.

728
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,240
But?

729
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,842
He did.

730
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,345
Yet he had those hobbies and

731
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:21,013
interests that were definitely

732
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:25,316
of a gentry class
and gentry nature.

733
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,152
His portrait.

734
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,252
Great example.

735
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:27,753
And his writing habit.

736
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:29,454
That's a great example.

737
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:31,856
You do get to a certain level

738
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,358
of success and all of a sudden,

739
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,826
this seems like a good idea and

740
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,862
it's never a good
idea at that age.

741
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:38,197
At any age.

742
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:41,266
Exactly.

743
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,868
Was he politically
active at all?

744
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,503
He was a middle of
the road democrat.

745
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:48,006
That's what he said.

746
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,508
He said you have to bring
black education up with white

747
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,343
education and since the state of

748
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,544
Mississippi will not invest in

749
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:57,815
black education it's up
to its citizens to do so.

750
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,217
He said that segregation wasn't

751
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,718
about being right or wrong.

752
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:03,221
He said any sane, sober
southerner knows that it's

753
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:03,455
wrong.

754
00:32:03,456 --> 00:32:06,224
It's about wanting
to change or not.

755
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:09,294
But people don't want
to give up power.

756
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,196
Fear is still alive and
well in Mississippi.

757
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,563
I think racism is one of those

758
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,465
great things in the world that

759
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,866
you'll never solve and that's

760
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:22,507
why Faulkner wrote about it.

761
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:26,978
Writers as I know from looking
in my own dark heart,

762
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:27,713
are generally terrible people.

763
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:28,714
Put ten of them together and

764
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:32,750
it's like putting your head
in a bag full of snakes.

765
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,419
I meet a bunch of them above

766
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,921
city grocery, John currant's
place on the square.

767
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,756
There's the brilliant author Tom

768
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:43,894
Franklin and his wife, the
poet Beth Ann Fennely.

769
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,431
Grisham writers in residence,

770
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:54,432
Megan Abbott, Pendarvis, a
senior writer for ESPN,

771
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,943
novelist, Ace Atkins.

772
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:02,713
Poet, Derek Harell is
originally from Milwaukee.

773
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:08,619
Crime novelist Billy
Boyle from Brooklyn.

774
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,954
Downstairs, currant's restaurant

775
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:13,124
city grocery cranks out
many delicious things.

776
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:16,227
The man known as big bad chef,

777
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,628
aka Johnny snack, is sending

778
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,297
some of those goodies upstairs

779
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:20,531
as there's nothing professional

780
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:26,737
writers like more
than free food.

781
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:27,872
Usually you put five writers

782
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:32,210
in a room, it's an ugly hell
broth of envy, hatred...

783
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:32,978
We all hate Tommy.

784
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:35,446
That goes without saying.

785
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:39,317
I hate me worst of all.

786
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:42,320
The writers are really
supportive of each other.

787
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:43,888
For writers to argue would be

788
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,757
like arguing over
a piece of dirt.

789
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,159
What are we fighting about?

790
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,128
The stakes are so low, why would

791
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:53,098
you be a jerk about it?

792
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,099
If Mississippi were a country

793
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,268
and there were a national hero,

794
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:00,004
dead or alive, by consensus,

795
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:00,972
state-wide, who would
the statue be of?

796
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:01,473
Elvis.

797
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:07,078
Really?

798
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,146
It wouldn't even be him.

799
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:10,981
It should be B.B. King.

800
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:11,350
Yeah.

801
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:11,983
But it would be Elvis.

802
00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:14,419
It would be Elvis.

803
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,354
Mississippi I you know, the

804
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,355
joke is that it's not a state,

805
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:20,358
it's a club, that it's so small

806
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:21,859
that everybody knows everybody.

807
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,862
In the middle of Mississippi,

808
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:31,202
Oxford is an oasis of thought

809
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:34,205
and literature and feeling.

810
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,206
The velvet ditch.

811
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:36,774
Why the velvet ditch?

812
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,943
It's pretty freaking
comfortable.

813
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:41,846
You don't care much
about getting out.

814
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:42,148
Right?

815
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:42,514
Right?

816
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:43,382
Am I right?

817
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:45,049
No one here seems too
bitter about that.

818
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,651
It's a place that needs help

819
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:47,952
but it's a really great place.

820
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:49,255
We're never leaving.

821
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:11,242
Is there a distinctive
barbecue style in the state of

822
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:11,543
Mississippi?

823
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:12,743
No.

824
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,912
Not that we can really
discern at all.

825
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,682
And it's part of the reason
that we wanted to do this.

826
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,350
We got our hands on this place

827
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,853
and sort of been puzzled for
years of what Mississippi

828
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:23,555
barbecue is all about.

829
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:27,658
The more I dug into it, the
less and less I could find.

830
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,394
So what we wanted to do is sort

831
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:32,062
of take a look at barbecue that

832
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,831
surrounds us and see if we could

833
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:39,170
sort of Frankenstein barbecue.

834
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:43,040
Isn't really any fixed idea
of Mississippi barbecue and

835
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:46,076
other than this place, Lamar

836
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,079
lounge, John currant's not for

837
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,048
profit bar/restaurant, there's

838
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:55,052
no other pit-smoked barbecue
in the entire state.

839
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:59,390
A 175 pound pig will
feed many mouths.

840
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,226
About 250 people eat here a day.

841
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:04,629
This is a not for
profit establishment?

842
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:04,963
Yeah.

843
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:05,697
Is that right?

844
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:07,265
Yeah, it sure is.

845
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:11,569
What sort of communist
socialist are you up to?

846
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:11,970
What's going on?

847
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:13,738
This is the state
of Mississippi.

848
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,105
Just a feel-good type of guy.

849
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:20,144
Me, too.

850
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,446
I've been here only a week and

851
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:24,282
my sentences are starting to

852
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,251
change already, because there's

853
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:26,751
not just a physical rhythm to

854
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,420
the speech, but the way I'm
organizing my thoughts is

855
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,089
starting to change.

856
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,091
Some of the Oxford writers from

857
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,426
last night managed to make it

858
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,262
out of bed, heads pounding no

859
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:39,464
doubt, filled with the shame and

860
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:42,333
self-loathing surely
familiar for writers.

861
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:45,236
But like such greats of the past

862
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:50,107
as Malcolm Lowery, F. Scott
Fitzgerald, they too have

863
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,276
learned that more alcohol first

864
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:55,346
thing will often make you
feel better about the world.

865
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:59,317
Particularly if accompanied
by freshly baked cornbread,

866
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:00,951
biscuits, pulled pork off that

867
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:05,790
whole hog, sweet jerk
chicken and brisket.

868
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:09,960
Hell, I feel better already.

869
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:10,961
The Mississippi I perceived

870
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,797
is not the Mississippi
I had in my head.

871
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:15,800
I was surprised how
sold I was off the bat.

872
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:18,769
If you want to write,
come to Oxford.

873
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,605
You think that's true?

874
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:21,507
Apparently, yes.

875
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:25,543
Like that line you can't throw
a rock without hitting a

876
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:25,811
writer.

877
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:29,146
Do me a favor, throw it hard.

878
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:33,484
It's easy to look at
Mississippi and go that just

879
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:34,719
happens down there
so we're good.

880
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,321
Our hands are clean.

881
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,623
It's a totally
misperceived place.

882
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,991
When I came, I fell in
love with the place.

883
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,493
I never thought that I would.

884
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:43,661
There's something to it but you

885
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:49,500
can't put your finger
on what it is.

886
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,037
What it is can be found in
the dark spaces across the

887
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:56,140
tracks and on the
other side of town.

888
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:59,910
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.

889
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,347
Welcome to the lounge
right by the cemetery.

890
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:10,348
♪

891
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:30,668
What is a juke joint?

892
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,770
You heard reference to them,
no doubt, but what is it?

893
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,938
I guess the first thing you've

894
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:39,309
got to know is it's
pronounced juk joint.

895
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,414
And this one is a real good one.

896
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:47,785
Scholars suggested juk came from

897
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:50,655
enslaved Africans and it meant

898
00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:57,294
wicked or disorderly, to
dance, or a place of shelter.

899
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:02,199
Juke joints started in the
plantation community rooms

900
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:02,668
during slavery times.

901
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:03,834
They went on to become the

902
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:05,970
small, private African-American

903
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:07,304
bars, clubs and lounges.

904
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,974
First in rural areas, then in

905
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:12,477
towns and cities where workers

906
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,679
could dance, drink, party and

907
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,681
gamble as respite from the hard

908
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:18,883
labor of sharecropping, tenant

909
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:21,619
farming, house service
and segregation.

910
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,220
They were often condemned by

911
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:29,393
church leaders as
houses of the devil.

912
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,829
William runs this place, as he

913
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,833
has since 1963, and
he makes the rules.

914
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:42,808
How long has this
been in business?

915
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,476
How did you get
into this business?

916
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:46,911
Something I like to do.

917
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:49,246
Everybody come in and enjoy
themselves, no problem.

918
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,882
Please explain this policy.

919
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:58,188
No hats backwards and
no .pants hanging down.

920
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,625
If you don't like the
rules, don't come.

921
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,192
No rap music.

922
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:08,933
Give me a headache.

923
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:11,001
I love blues.

924
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,369
Good R&B?

925
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,204
That's right.

926
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:15,205
But no rap?

927
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:19,877
If Kanye West wants to rent out

928
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,378
the place you'll rent it to him?

929
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:27,552
I'll rent it to him.

930
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:27,953
Thank you, sir.

931
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:29,954
I love your place and
thank you for having us.

932
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:31,722
Got to come back again.

933
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:32,890
I surely will.

934
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:35,192
I'll find somebody to
get naked with you.

935
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:38,863
Uh-oh.

936
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:46,864
Okay, you can kick it back off.

937
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,943
Thursday night is family
night at Po monkeys.

938
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:55,412
Mostly locals, mixed bag.

939
00:41:55,413 --> 00:42:03,413
The music is classic
R&B and predisco soul.

940
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:04,656
Attitude, loose.

941
00:42:04,657 --> 00:42:07,725
Just familiarize with those
rules and there won't be a

942
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:13,130
problem.

943
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:16,400
In the cities of the north

944
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,434
where I come from, in some ways

945
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:21,639
we've been able to buy
ourselves free from our past.

946
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,909
New arrivals pour in with no

947
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,845
member of the ugly
parts of our history.

948
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:30,414
We can afford the
luxury of the new.

949
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:33,117
We can live in comfortable

950
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:36,286
bubbles, our apartments
high in the sky.

951
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,323
In many way, more separate
than at anytime in history.

952
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:43,961
But for Mississippi, the
past is right there to see.

953
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:48,132
Still present, and coming to
terms with it, not through

954
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:53,304
abstract discussion, but the
daily business of life.
