00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:47,379
church has less relevancy.

185
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,717
For the unforgiven and
the unforgiveable.

186
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,418
For those on whom the catholic

187
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:58,891
saints have turned their
backs, there is Santa Muerte.

188
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,393
This is a place and Santa Muerte

189
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,462
is a Saint that
accepts everybody.

190
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:07,734
Death to my enemies written
on a votive candle.

191
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,068
Let's face it, we have all

192
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:16,075
prayed for that at one
point or another.

193
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:16,710
Topito is a poor neighborhood,

194
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:19,746
for sure, and a tough one.

195
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:27,747
A center of commerce both
above-board and not.

196
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,561
Perhaps a breakfast
beverage first.

197
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,797
A michelada.

198
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,132
One giant beer with lemon, chili

199
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,602
powder, salt and magi sauce.

200
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,772
That's a sizeable
morning beverage.

201
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:50,609
My companion, blogger and
chronicler of the city, Jorge

202
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:50,811
Pedro.

203
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,344
Wow.

204
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:55,314
A whole season of the
walking dead for 25 cents.

205
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,951
You want to buy something,
Topito's got it.

206
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:02,321
Looking for some cheap
underwear, pirated copies of man

207
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,689
versus food seasons
one through five?

208
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,125
This is where you find them.

209
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,294
So this all seems
very wholesome.

210
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,863
Where can I buy a gun, some
heroin and a prostitute.

211
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,299
I was looking forward to that.

212
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,935
Let's say Topito
has many layers.

213
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:16,369
Right.

214
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,870
And we are in the surface.

215
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:18,605
Okay.

216
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:25,711
We are among movies,
clothing, families.

217
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,714
But I don't think it's... to ask

218
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,182
where can I get the gun.

219
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:38,183
Probably they will kill
you if you ask that.

220
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,128
You know the patron Saint
of hopeless cases.

221
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:42,996
Lost causes.

222
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:46,498
It's become very popular
in the last years.

223
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,868
A lot of good smells here, man.

224
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:54,506
A lot of good-looking food.

225
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,242
My happy place is
somewhere in here.

226
00:12:56,243 --> 00:13:00,312
Oh, there it is.

227
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:00,547
Yeah.

228
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:03,315
Beautiful.

229
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,351
Wherever there's bones and guts

230
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:09,922
simmering in broth, chances
are I'll be happy.

231
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:14,760
Writer, sociologist and
life-long resident of Topito,

232
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:17,529
Alphonso Hernandez, apparently
feels the same way.

233
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,065
Is this supposed to be
a bad neighborhood?

234
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:19,499
This is the best.

235
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,536
I love this neighborhood.

236
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:32,537
This is known for being the
lost souls neighborhood.

237
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:37,249
In Topito, there are no
angels but lost souls.

238
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:45,250
What's the saying?

239
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,801
Show your... to the devil?

240
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:56,736
To death.

241
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:58,570
The boil comes from cracked

242
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,773
hambones to release the marrow

243
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:07,146
which onion and pepper is added.

244
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:12,418
Thickened with stale bread
and leftover tortillas.

245
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,820
You make something
awesome out of nothing.

246
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:19,892
Grandmothers take advantage
of the bones of the pigs.

247
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:23,062
Any great old culture where
there's poverty, there's

248
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,331
something like this.

249
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,833
If you're watching this after

250
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,401
you do this, you really got to

251
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,471
wash your hands before you touch

252
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:38,410
your... that's a rookie mistake.

253
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:41,480
She's asking you if
you like the meal.

254
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:41,949
Yeah, it's good.

255
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:47,419
Delicious.

256
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,955
So this has been open 65 years?

257
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,523
All the members of the
crew are relatives.

258
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:55,827
Is there hope for social
change in this country?

259
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,130
Unfortunately, Mexico has

260
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:01,968
become the Topito of the world.

261
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,303
Topito, this is still the
emphasis of the Mexican.

262
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,173
Not a lot of upward
mobility here.

263
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,841
The rich get richer, the poor

264
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:15,948
get ground slowly
under the wheel.

265
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,683
Edwardo Garcia has hacked his

266
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,218
way up the ladder to become chef

267
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,087
owner of the city's
hottest restaurant.

268
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,022
I grew up in the states.

269
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:24,156
I was a migrant worker picking

270
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,624
fruits and vegetables as a kid.

271
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,359
My parents didn't earn a lot of

272
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,898
money, so I decided to work
rather than go to school.

273
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,136
The restaurant business as I
well know ain't no picnic.

274
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,339
In Mexico City, it's
particularly rough.

275
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,209
Mexico has a reputation where

276
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:49,481
we all know that the country's
run by corrupt politics.

277
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,084
You have to stand up
for what you believe.

278
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,852
If you don't, people
will run you over.

279
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:57,156
You won't last a minute.

280
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:02,594
I don't let people
bully me around.

281
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:10,595
Garcia runs Maximo bistro
with his wife, Gabriella.

282
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,838
Here's the extra crap you have

283
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,340
to deal with if you run the

284
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,707
hottest restaurant
in Mexico city.

285
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,010
In 2013, the spoiled daughter of

286
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,878
the head of Mexico's consumer

287
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,180
protection agency walks in and

288
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,850
demands a table when there's
unsurprisingly, no table

289
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:25,118
available.

290
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,686
When Garcia says sorry, no can

291
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,555
do, she pulls a you know who I

292
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,123
am and then calls daddy and gets

293
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:36,395
the health inspectors in
to shut the place down.

294
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,964
So your other customers
basically started taking

295
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,232
pictures with their cell phones?

296
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,368
Next thing you know, we have

297
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,403
the media outside
and this is Friday.

298
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,937
Right.

299
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,207
Sunday morning, we're front
page of one of the most

300
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,975
important newspapers in Mexico.

301
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,411
It was very embarrassing
to the government.

302
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,412
And it should be.

303
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,446
Because they got caught doing

304
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,048
what they do all the time but if

305
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,650
you were not the hottest
restaurant in town, you were

306
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,387
just running a cantina
a few blocks away...

307
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,754
I would have... they
would have closed you

308
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:08,260
down and that's that.

309
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,796
Right now, the defiant young

310
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:11,897
creative generation of chefs

311
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,765
like Edwardo are performing some

312
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:14,933
of the most exciting cooking

313
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,135
anywhere on earth, a mixing of

314
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:24,136
the very old and traditional
with the very new.

315
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,845
As a kid, one of the jobs

316
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:30,116
throughout the whole time that I

317
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,783
worked is how old
are you, I'm 18.

318
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:36,455
You've been 18 for three years.

319
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,125
Those are abilone.

320
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,659
I told you I love butter.

321
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,762
I use it even for some Mexican

322
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:44,963
dishes and then just roasted

323
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,833
chilies just to give it a
nice little kick for me.

324
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:48,801
They are finished with lemon

325
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,769
and of course, brown butter.

326
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,939
Beautiful.

327
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,107
Mm.

328
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:56,808
Very delicious.

329
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,978
Very Mexican, very French.

330
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:00,780
Brown butter, awesome.

331
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:01,947
Makes everything better.

332
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,883
Of course.

333
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,152
I think the most important thing

334
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:07,686
about Mexican cuisine in general

335
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:13,525
if it's traditional,
it's the ingredients.

336
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:17,963
Successling pig topped
with grandma's salsa.

337
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:18,398
An instant classic.

338
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:19,798
Have at it.

339
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,000
You do it like the Mexican way.

340
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:28,307
Pick it up and go.

341
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:28,841
Wow.

342
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,543
Pretty hard to imagine
anything better than that.

343
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,180
You're stuck with this
dish forever, man.

344
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,582
It's going to be like Mick

345
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,650
Jagger 50 years from now
singing "satisfaction."

346
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:39,918
There's no getting
away from it, man.

347
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,320
This is so good.

348
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:42,921
This is a classic.

349
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,358
But even now with all his
success, Garcia is still

350
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,327
fighting a struggle most
Mexicans are all too familiar

351
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,197
with.

352
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:55,033
What happened that day
happens every day.

353
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,268
And the promise always is we're

354
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,338
going to shut you down,
you don't know who I am.

355
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,207
And for me, I would rather close

356
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,210
my restaurant than
live like that.

357
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,577
If you close my restaurant, I

358
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,213
will go across the street, I

359
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,880
will go to another state or I

360
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,750
will go to another country, and

361
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,988
I still will make a
good restaurant.

362
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:37,909
Under former president Felipe
Calderon, Mexico launched

363
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,746
a concerted war on drugs.

364
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:41,980
Ostensibly against the notorious

365
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:46,151
and seemingly
untouchable cartels.

366
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,319
Absolutely no one can say with

367
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,758
any credibility, by the way,
that Mexico's war or our

368
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,726
trillion dollar war has had any

369
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,428
effect in diminishing the flow

370
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,400
of drugs into our country.

371
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,769
One very brave journalist has

372
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,604
uncovered exactly how deep the

373
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,005
rot of corruption and dirty

374
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,341
money has penetrated into every

375
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:17,342
level of Mexican institutions.

376
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,686
My grandmother, how we used

377
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:24,756
to drink is never with
lemon, it was with orange.

378
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,292
It is not what a lot of

379
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,794
people wanted to hear,
much less see published.

380
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:36,134
Today, Anibelle Hernandez
lives under guard in a secret

381
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:36,403
location.

382
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:40,672
The threat, very, very
real and very explicit.

383
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,508
You think there was ever a

384
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,643
minute when the Calderon war on

385
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:45,211
drugs, was it ever genuine?

386
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:48,480
No.

387
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,715
Calderon start the war against

388
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:55,687
the drug cartels, he just

389
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,489
followed that instruction but he

390
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,160
didn't really do anything new.

391
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,329
He just did it worse.

392
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,664
Since the beginning, the plan

393
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,666
was protect the cartel and fight

394
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:12,070
against the enemies
of this cartel.

395
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:17,042
Of the seven major Mexican

396
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,511
cartels, the Cineloa cartel is

397
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:20,246
considered the most powerful

398
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:24,683
with the farthest reaching
and most pervasive tentacles

399
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,251
extending deep into every corner

400
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:30,188
of government, banking
and private industry.

401
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:34,225
Its rivals, the Tijuana cartel,

402
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:39,230
the Gulf cartel, the Juarez

403
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:45,203
cartel, la Familia Micharcana.

404
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,339
The cartels are responsible for

405
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,407
importing roughly three quarters

406
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:54,946
of all illegal
narcotics to America.

407
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,682
In your work, you uncovered what

408
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,384
had to be some very embarrassing

409
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:01,219
and incriminating associations

410
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,390
and connections between very

411
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:09,361
high elected officials,
the presidents and entire

412
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:12,531
administrations, and acts
of incredible criminality.

413
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,401
How did that change your life?

414
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:18,370
When I started to make this

415
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:24,075
investigation in 2005, I really

416
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,145
understand that it would
be very dangerous.

417
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:30,416
I have to say that it wasn't

418
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:34,753
really a surprise for me what

419
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,889
happened after I
published my book.

420
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,658
What I didn't expect is that the

421
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,594
threats came from the
federal government.

422
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,664
She says that one of her
sources warned her that the

423
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,433
biggest threat was from within,

424
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:50,602
that one of the most highly
placed, most senior law

425
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:54,640
enforcement officials in
Mexico had ordered her killed.

426
00:22:54,641 --> 00:23:02,448
Because in my book, I put his
name and also showed some

427
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,082
documents that proves that he

428
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,118
was involved, he was on the
payroll of this cartel.

429
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,654
What happened to this man?

430
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:12,257
Right now, he's very happy

431
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:19,297
drinking rum, I think, building
many enterprises, fake

432
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,799
enterprises, laundry his money.

433
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,602
To me, a banker who launders

434
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,103
money, he's got a family, he's

435
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,605
got a reputation, he gives money

436
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:27,939
to charity, his neighbors think

437
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,808
he's great, his kids think he's

438
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,943
wonderful, he's got
something to lose.

439
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,712
So I wouldn't be
prosecuting drug dealers.

440
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,280
I would be prosecuting bankers.

441
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:43,281
The name of my book is what

442
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,791
it is because the leaders of

443
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:52,130
these cartels know,
they are also this.

444
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,166
The politicians and bankers and

445
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,702
the businessmen, the people have

446
00:23:56,703 --> 00:24:00,171
to know who are these
people by name.

447
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,073
You have been a
journalist for how long?

448
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:02,542
20.

449
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,175
20 years.

450
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:03,876
20 years.

451
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:07,846
Your father was killed,
kidnapped and killed in 2000?

452
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:12,250
My father was a businessman.

453
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,419
In that year, many gangs used to

454
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,924
kidnap businessmen
just for money.

455
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:21,860
So when we went to the police

456
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,428
and asked them to investigate,

457
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:27,032
they said well, if you pay us,

458
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:30,035
we will make the investigation.

459
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:33,872
So as family, we decide to pay

460
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:37,008
because you cannot
buy the justice.

461
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,911
Since that, I really tried
to fight against corruption.

462
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,914
That's why I'm doing what I do,

463
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,350
because I think that corruption

464
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:48,053
is the worst problem in Mexico.

465
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:51,857
The drug cartels are maybe the

466
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:55,060
worst face of that problem, but

467
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:56,862
the problem in the deep
is the corruption.

468
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,697
The corruption is the mother of

469
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,098
all our problems in Mexico.

470
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:03,935
It should be pointed out that
88 journalists, how many

471
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,637
journalists have been
killed in this country?

472
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:06,372
90 now.

473
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:08,740
90 journalists have now been

474
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,308
killed or disappeared
over the last few years.

475
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:13,378
Yeah.

476
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,314
You can kill a journalist
and get away with it.

477
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:19,651
Why are you still here?

478
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:24,122
I have lost many
things in my life.

479
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:30,061
My father was the most
important person in my life.

480
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:30,730
I already lost everything.

481
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:33,632
I don't have any life anymore.

482
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:37,502
I don't have a social life.

483
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,237
I don't have a sentimental life.

484
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:39,939
I don't have anything.

485
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,175
I just have my work
and my family.

486
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:49,080
And my work of a journalist
is everything for me.

487
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,916
I really believe that good
journalists can change the

488
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:54,119
world.

489
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,421
I have received many offers to

490
00:25:56,422 --> 00:26:00,358
go outside to France, to
Sweden and other countries.

491
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,693
I don't want to leave.

492
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:02,461
It's my choice.

493
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:06,933
My choice is fight.

494
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:24,482
I came to Ahawka for mescal.

495
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:28,620
I like mescal more and more

496
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,521
these days and this guy, Ron

497
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,224
Cooper, finds and sells some of

498
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,294
the best mescal in the world.

499
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:44,295
We're at the Zappatec
ruins of Monte Alba.

500
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,906
In pre-conquest Mexico, there

501
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:53,011
were gods and goddesses of
intoxication and ecstasy.

502
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:55,546
The touch of a lover, the smell

503
00:26:55,547 --> 00:27:00,752
of a flower, the a-ha of an

504
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:04,322
idea, all had gods and goddesses

505
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:08,994
that took responsibility
for those things.

506
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:11,362
All of your mescals come from

507
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,832
different villages and
only that village?

508
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,734
And only one maker
in that village.

509
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:18,536
We call ourself single village

510
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:21,372
mescal because most mescals are

511
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,374
made with a blend of different

512
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,609
villages all put together.

513
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:29,014
No one goes home and has a
cocktail in these Indian

514
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:29,281
villages.

515
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:37,282
They wait until there's
a special occasion.

516
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:43,695
Every birth, death, confirmation,
baptism, there's a

517
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:43,930
fiesta.

518
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:46,698
A wedding is eight days.

519
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,066
You invite 200 people.

520
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,468
You feed them breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

521
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:54,973
You have a band every day.

522
00:27:54,974 --> 00:28:00,278
And then they really consume.

523
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:06,651
Don't drink yet.

524
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:14,652
For mother earth
and her ancestors.

525
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:20,131
That's extraordinary.

526
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:23,134
Back in the day, it was cheap

527
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,770
stuff with a worm in it and

528
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:25,571
there were rumors that if you

529
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:30,842
ate the worm, you would
start tripping, there was a

530
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,944
hallucinogenic component
to that stuff.

531
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,245
Is there a particular
kind of high?

532
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,114
Is this an enlightening high?

533
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,282
Is this a good high?

534
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,416
The high is humorous.

535
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,851
There are funny thoughts dancing

536
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,186
around the back of your head.

537
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:43,188
Happy, witty thoughts.

538
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,422
Yes.

539
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:47,192
Ancient, indigenous traditions
of ingredients define

540
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:55,166
not only the mescal
but also the food.

541
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,534
One of the main reasons

542
00:28:56,535 --> 00:29:03,274
people visit our city is to eat.

543
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:09,314
This is Alejandro Romedo,
one of Mexico's best chefs.

544
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,448
He started cooking young.

545
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,716
When he was 12, his mother died

546
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:17,222
and it fell on him to raise
and feed his five siblings.

547
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:22,493
This is what we call...
Today he draws much of his

548
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,830
inspiration from Wahawka's
central market.

549
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:26,832
Probably America's most beloved

550
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:27,866
food is what they think
is Mexican food.

551
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,468
Yes.

552
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,804
And I think most Americans'

553
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:36,641
view of Mexican food is beans,

554
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:39,010
fried tortilla, melted
cheese, some chicken.

555
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,979
Yes.

556
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,413
In fact, in particular when

557
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,816
talking about Wahawka, this is a

558
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,751
deep, really
sophisticated cuisine.

559
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:49,754
That's correct.

560
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:53,691
Wahawka has different
microclimates all over our

561
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:53,993
territory.

562
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:55,326
That gives us this enormous

563
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:59,730
amount of surprises,
produce, fruits, chilis.

564
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,532
Like 500,000 varieties of corn.

565
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:09,407
This is where the good... grows.

566
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,742
This lady here is
always making the best.

567
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:12,578
Tender.

568
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:12,945
Yes.

569
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:17,048
Tender, tasty.

570
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:17,683
Crunch.

571
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:21,853
Cabbage and cilantro.

572
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,588
Oh, unbelievably good.

573
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:31,589
So tasty.

574
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:33,866
Mm.

575
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,533
Deep.

576
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:35,801
It's good.

577
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:37,702
I'll finish this.

578
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:41,873
This is just too damn good.

579
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:43,909
People have this barbecue
especially on Sundays.

580
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,410
It's a tradition.

581
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:52,411
So tasty.

582
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:56,654
All this is full of chilis.

583
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:59,790
People think that Mexican food

584
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,593
is spicy because of
all the chili we use.

585
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,795
We go for flavor,
not for the spices.

586
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,998
What most people miss is
how really deep and really

587
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,600
sophisticated the
sauces here can be.

588
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,170
Like Lyon is to France, wahawka

589
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,139
is to Mexico, in my experience.

590
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,240
You're right.

591
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,342
Also in my experience.

592
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:19,110
Not kissing your ass here.

593
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:23,248
I was just in Lyon.

594
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,682
This is Vicky's place.

595
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:27,318
She has been cooking up
traditional Wahawkan dishes in

596
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,455
the market for 30 years.

597
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,290
Whoa, that's awesome.

598
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:35,160
Oh, man.

599
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:37,262
So the guy working, first of

600
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:39,931
all, a lot of what you
see now are metal.

601
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,933
That's old school,
super old school.

602
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:47,939
That's the way they did
back on the Clay Kamal.

603
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,775
I'm looking there, he's doing

604
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,278
tortillas and doing one of my

605
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,015
favorite things, zucchini
flour with string cheese.

606
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,016
So pretty to see.

607
00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:02,820
His cooking is focused, his

608
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:10,821
passion have very
old, very deep roots.

609
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:18,569
Since you are 6, 7, 8, you

610
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,505
have the responsibility to help

611
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:22,173
water the plantation, milk the

612
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,541
cows and help my mom when she

613
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,476
was making tortillas like that,

614
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:26,978
she would give me directions and

615
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,247
say okay, roll the chilis, roll

616
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:32,417
the tomatoes, I will tell you
how to prepare the salsa.

617
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:34,019
It was the beginning of my

618
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,154
profession, learning from the

619
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:37,855
knowledge of how a tomato should

620
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:40,858
taste like when you cut it
directly from the plant.

621
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:41,427
The way it should taste.

622
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:46,831
That's right.

623
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,033
Oh, man.

624
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:48,234
Happy.

625
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:51,936
This is what I should do.

626
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,004
Try it first like this.

627
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,505
Just grab a hunk.

628
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:54,740
Yes.

629
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,607
Put salsa.

630
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:58,576
Yeah.

631
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:02,180
I haven't been anywhere in
Mexico where the cooking is

632
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:02,781
better than here.

633
00:33:02,782 --> 00:33:07,253
This is the way to share our
culture, through our food.

634
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:26,537
The quiet little town of Teo

635
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:29,574
de Kline El beye is outside of

636
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:30,608
wahawka, a town where the crafts

637
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,279
and traditions of prehispanic
Mexico are celebrated and

638
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:40,551
packaged for consumption.

639
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:43,421
Abigail Mendosa and her sister

640
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,323
are Zapotec, original people

641
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:48,993
from Mexico before the
Spanish, before the Aztecs.

642
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:52,297
This is her restaurant, where

643
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:55,966
Abigail has been grinding corn

644
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,602
by hand, making food like this,

645
00:33:57,603 --> 00:34:00,438
the ridiculously faithful,

646
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,273
time-consuming traditional way

647
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:06,244
she was taught to make these

648
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:06,845
things and the way she's been

649
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:10,148
making them since she
was 6 years old.

650
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:13,651
Look at her hands, by the way.

651
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,286
Small, surprisingly delicate,

652
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:17,788
given all the hard work, all the

653
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,157
pushing, kneading, grinding,

654
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:21,792
stone against stone
over the years.

655
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,594
Then look at her forearms.

656
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:24,296
The power there.

657
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:32,297
It's impressive and beautiful.

658
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:35,640
Every time you enter the

659
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,508
house, in wahawka, especially in

660
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:41,512
the small villages, they always

661
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:42,980
offer you a shot of mescal.

662
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:48,853
Mm, so good.

663
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,988
A molee and chicken dish, this

664
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,890
sauce like a lot of the old

665
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,660
school sauces made by masters

666
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,128
like Abigail use 35 different

667
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,396
types of chili peppers and take

668
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:03,301
more than two weeks to make.

669
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:06,904
Do you think that until
recently, until guys like you,

670
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:09,340
that Mexicans were not looking

671
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,309
back at their own food culture,

672
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,643
they were looking elsewhere?

673
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,379
What was going on?

674
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,547
We were conquerers.

675
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,749
We are were also a culture that

676
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,885
was conquered first by the

677
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,688
Aztecs and then conquered by the

678
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:24,590
Spaniards so we were always

679
00:35:24,591 --> 00:35:27,192
taught everything that was
good and excellent has to be

680
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:27,459
imported.

681
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,327
Right.

682
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:29,727
What we have here, it
was just not good.

683
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:33,063
Right.

684
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:37,368
Another zapotecan classic, chili

685
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,204
agua, a simpler dish of cow and

686
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:41,172
pork brains cooked with chili,

687
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,874
tomatoes and yorba Santa.

688
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,576
As a cook, the main thing

689
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,946
was to develop a little
bit my cuisine here.

690
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:54,752
There was this space where
nobody tried to innovate.

691
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:57,087
Still using the same techniques,

692
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,623
the same ingredient, the same

693
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:04,362
flavors, herbs, et cetera, but

694
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:11,436
developing them a little bit.

695
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:16,307
I mean, that's as
old-school as it gets.

696
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:19,777
A final dish, this one, this

697
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:27,778
is something that you do not
find anywhere as Mexico.

698
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,793
The quoi yet night.

699
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:43,794
The central square of Wahaka.

700
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,606
But even tonight there's plenty

701
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,609
of evidence of the struggle, the

702
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:59,584
discontent boiling just
under the surface.

703
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:01,786
The graffiti and painting of

704
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:09,787
this street artist captures
that spirit of protest.

705
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,298
♪

706
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:16,367
Tie last supper, for sure.

707
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,936
Last supper by Mexican.

708
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,538
Who are these people?

709
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:24,008
These are most powerful
people in Mexico.

710
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:27,445
People that is driving Mexico.

711
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,847
This is the president right now.

712
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:30,616
This is Calderon.

713
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:31,016
Right.

714
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:32,017
The last president.

715
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:32,718
The last president.

716
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:35,152
That guy is like
the economy guy.

717
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:35,454
Right.

718
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:39,524
Who's moving the
economy in Mexico.

719
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:42,960
And this is the army.

720
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,795
This is a prostitute.

721
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:48,132
This represent because
they are like prostitutes.

722
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,800
Right.

723
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:50,968
You know?

724
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,703
And narco traffic.

725
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:52,938
Oh.

726
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:55,573
He is like the god in Mexico.

727
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,207
You know?

728
00:37:56,208 --> 00:38:00,144
Because he is, like,
over... all of it.

729
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:00,479
Yeah.

730
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,647
So this is the way Mexico works?

731
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:03,148
Yeah.

732
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:09,654
For me, the most problem in
Mexico is the corruption.

733
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:14,392
Mexico can be a dangerous
place for journalists, for

734
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:15,327
politicians, for police.

735
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:18,028
Is it a dangerous
place for artists in.

736
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:18,263
Yeah.

737
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:20,898
I think so a little bit because

738
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,900
you do not agree with the

739
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:23,569
government, you are like enemy.

740
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:27,373
Right.

741
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:45,956
In 1936, the town 50 miles

742
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:50,595
from Mexico City was
visited by Malcolm Lowry.

743
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:54,799
The tormented self loathing
brilliant and hopelessly

744
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,233
alcoholic author.

745
00:38:56,234 --> 00:39:00,471
His life work under the
volcano was set here.

746
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,272
It is widely believed to be one

747
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:06,243
of the great novels
of the 20th century.

748
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:10,815
Lowry saw symbolism and
evil everywhere here.

749
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:15,553
In the deep areas, the looming

750
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:23,554
volcano that towered overhead.

751
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:30,267
Writer, poet, Javier Cecilia,

752
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:34,071
has reason to see evil, too.

753
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:38,275
On march 28th, 2011, narcos

754
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:42,079
kidnapped and murdered his son

755
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,417
and six other equally
blameless victims.

756
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,518
Cecilia found himself to march

757
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,253
to Mexico City to demand an end

758
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,456
to the increasingly futile

759
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:54,091
so-called war on drugs that was

760
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:58,328
mindlessly grinding up so many

761
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:06,329
victims in the crossfire
and in the margins.

762
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:21,118
In "Under the volcano," the evil

763
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,290
that's coming is
fascism, Naziism.

764
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:32,430
When's the heart of the
infernal machine today?

765
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:48,713
What does he want to say?

766
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:52,718
What does he want
people to hear?

767
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,939
Can he think of one place on

768
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,674
earth where the good guys are

769
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,576
winning and where you are not

770
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:26,577
ground under the
wheels of the machine?

771
00:41:54,646 --> 00:42:02,646
Have you written a poem since
the death of your son?

772
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:23,240
As I have come to know in my
own life, drugs, even drug

773
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:26,476
addiction, can be a
survivable event.

774
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,912
Death is not.

775
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:32,283
Death is final.
