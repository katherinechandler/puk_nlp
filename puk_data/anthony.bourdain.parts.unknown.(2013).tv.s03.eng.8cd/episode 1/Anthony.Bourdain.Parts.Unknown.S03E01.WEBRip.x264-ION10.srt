There used to be a

There were two very divided

golden temple, the Sikh
equivalent of the Vatican.

94
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,060
Sikhs are fundamentally against

any caste system, believers in

96
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,264

are just as fundamentally

98
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:23,903

00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,973

The sound is extraordinary.

124
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,327
We have a feeling that
everyone should serve to other

Walking me through it
all Tod Tod today.

127
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,672
For a religion so concerned with

128
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:44,677
tolerance, where does the
tradition come from?

129
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,948
Powerful people,
hard-working people.

130
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,517
Every Sikh you have seen, when

131
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,854
we get baptized, you must
protect yourself, you must

132
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,956
protect others and you must

133
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:02,896
protect your country so
that makes us what we are.

134
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,721
Morning.

135
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:32,992
The smoke from countless burning

136
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:40,993
fields covers the
city in a thick haze.

137
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,625
The ancient art evolved from

138
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,661
Indian wrestling techniques that

139
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,431
date back to the
fifth century B.C.

140
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,434
Ready, start!

141
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,769
Training is rigid.

142
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:24,770
This is not just a sport,
but a way of life.

143
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:29,281
Wrestlers live and train
together and have strict rules

144
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,549
of diet and personal conduct.

145
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:38,550
No smoking, no drinking,
no contact with women.

146
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,006
I took high school wrestling so

147
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,707
that I could get
out of gym class.

148
00:12:55,708 --> 00:13:03,708
I was a dirty, dirty fighter.

149
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,990
It's an all too natural segue

150
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:15,161
between the aggressive posturing

151
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,898
of opposing bodies and this.

152
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,267
The entire border between India

153
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:29,268
and Pakistan has
only one crossing.

154
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:32,212
Here.

155
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:34,013
Every sunset the border is

156
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:40,386
officially closed with this
bit of national theater.

157
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,022
Wearing nearly duplicate
uniforms, the Indian military

158
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:48,861
and Pakistani rangers partake in

159
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:52,364
a game of theatrical contempt.

160
00:13:52,365 --> 00:14:00,365
Clearly it's a popular show.

161
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,575
So where are we?

162
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,711
We are right next to Pakistan.

163
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,414
India and Pakistan were once

164
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,549
one country, ripped apart in one

165
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,553
of the hastiest, ill-considered
partitions imaginable.

166
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,754
Beyond there, no more fence?

167
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,723
No more fences.

168
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:19,558
So once you get past there,
you can go straight into

169
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,060
Pakistan if you want?

170
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,895
The problem is, the thing is,

171
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:26,065
India is trying to stop people

172
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,401
from coming in, infiltrators,
drug dealers, terrorists.

173
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:34,473
He is working on a
documentary about the

174
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,342
India/Pakistan border.

175
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:36,842
No one wants to go to Pakistan.

176
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:37,577
No one wants to?

177
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:39,946
In their right mind,
to go into Pakistan.

178
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,847
That's a fairly
decisive statement.

179
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:42,915
So they put up the fence but the

180
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,450
fence is on the Indian side.

181
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,918
Yeah.

182
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,453
It's 115 meters from the border.

183
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,755
So beyond that fence,
still Indian farmland.

184
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,190
Yes.

185
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,292
So people who live over
here can farm over there.

186
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,094
Farm over there.

187
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,829
The Punjab is a fertile region
in an otherwise very dry

188
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,498
country.

189
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,801
This is India's bread basket.

190
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:06,205
With over a billion people
currently residing in India,

191
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:10,042
every inch of fertile Punjabi
soil has great value.

192
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,477
These are people who own land

193
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,612
over there, then they put the

194
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:17,283
fence, suddenly your
life became difficult.

195
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,550
Exactly.

196
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,119
They can only grow some kind of

197
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,787
crops and they can't farm more

198
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:22,955
than eight hours in a day.

199
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,457
How long does it take
to get back and forth?

200
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,993
The border security force

201
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,027
manage these gates so they have

202
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:36,028
times when they can
enter and come out.

203
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,572
How much farther can we go
before they start to get

204
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:44,743
worried?

205
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:45,645
I think [ Inaudible ].

206
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:47,646
When India and Pakistan were

207
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:52,651
separated, the attempt was
to try to draw a line across

208
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,020
religious lines.

209
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,753
Exactly.

210
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,422
Drained by the colossal task

211
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,657
of fighting two world wars, in

212
00:15:58,658 --> 00:15:59,691
1947 Great Britain decided to

213
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,595
end their nearly 200 year rule

214
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,998
over India in an attempt to

215
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,933
prevent an inevitable civil war

216
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,170
between Hindus, Muslims and

217
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,706
Sikhs, the British commissioner
drew up a new border.

218
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,843
He was given two months.

219
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:21,680
Two months to create a
new country, basically.

220
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,017
People died because
of the displaced men.

221
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:29,388
Unofficially they say
two million people.

222
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,924
In one of the largest
exchanges of populations in

223
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:37,363
history, many millions of
people fled their homes.

224
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,598
Almost immediately, religious

225
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,268
violence broke out
on a mass scale.

226
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,271
This is exactly what the
partition had been intended to

227
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,039
avoid.

228
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,308
Do people here still have
families over there?

229
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:49,909
They do.

230
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,878
When the line was drawn, there

231
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,713
were religious
split into halves.

232
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,082
There are some houses where you

233
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,650
enter from India and
exit from Pakistan.

234
00:16:58,651 --> 00:16:59,885
Really.

235
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:00,053
Wow.

236
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:03,622
This part of Punjab and that

237
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,224
part of Punjab were once the

238
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,394
same so the cultures
are very similar.

239
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,096
It's a popular
metaphor for India.

240
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:11,997
Pakistan is twins
separated at birth.

241
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,065
We were never twins.

242
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,000
It was one country.

243
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,401
You could say dismembered.

244
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:16,735
If you cut a body in two, they

245
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,570
are not going to become twins.

246
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:22,641
Right.

247
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:23,675
It's sad, you know?

248
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:24,411
You can see them.

249
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:27,579
They are doing the same
work as you are doing.

250
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,014
They dress the same.

251
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:34,086
They look the same.

252
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,755
But you can't talk to them.

253
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,691
It is an ongoing struggle, an

254
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,992
enduring cause of paranoia,

255
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,929
visible all across the region.

256
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,765
Two nations with atomic arsenals

257
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,467
who have shown if nothing else,

258
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:56,468
a terrifying willingness
to use them.

259
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,200

a warrior class.

so much but still eaters.

Checking off my list of
things to do in the Punjab, I

got to score some
animal protein.

It's time.

299

I've been going all Morrisey for

300
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,699
two days now and
frankly, that's enough.

301
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:15,700
I need chicken.

Where am I?

00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:23,749
It's very famous for chicken.

305
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,251
When we are talking must-haves,
tandori chicken is

306
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,987
just that.

307
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,389

Oh, man, it's delicious.

This type of
establishment, dhaba?

311
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,334
This is the most
successful business here.

312
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:46,405
Anyone who open a dhaba
tomorrow, it will be like this.

313
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:49,007
But if you're going to have
chicken it better be good.

Yeah.

00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:09,608
self-absorbed, immune to my
surroundings.

371
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:10,209
But as my brightly colored

372
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:10,877
little train heads up into the

373
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:12,544
hills from Kalka station, known

374
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,946
as the gateway to the Himalayas,

375
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:22,947
my world view starts to improve.

376
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:32,330
The naturally bright colors of

377
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:36,835
India start to pleasurably
saturate my brain.

378
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:40,606
The view of the windows,
ridiculously deep valleys,

379
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:48,607
hundred-year-old Bridges,
it's, well, breath-taking.

380
00:25:56,322 --> 00:26:03,795
My fellow passengers, too,
are irresistibly chargming.

381
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,697
The school kids cheer in unison

382
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:13,698
every time we pass through
one of the tunnels.

383
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,517
Hip hip hooray!

384
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:30,789
I had pretty much forgotten
about my hunger until the

385
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:35,060
whistle stopped.

386
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:35,862
Two of these.

387
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:39,631
This place is named for a
colonel, the British engineer

388
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:43,468
tasked with building the line.

389
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,303
The station and the adjacent

390
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,505
tunnel bearing his name are
rumored to be haunted.

391
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:55,506
It's delicious.

392
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,548
Already behind schedule and

393
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:05,549
plagued by cost overruns,
Barog screwed up.

394
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,493
When he realized the two ends of

395
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:12,998
this tunnel didn't meet in
the middle, he shot himself.

396
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,833
It's the kind of personal

397
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,334
accountability I would like
to see more of, frankly.

398
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:24,109
Or is that just me?

399
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,712
All my snarkiness fades as one

400
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:27,713
can't help but reflect on what

401
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:29,414
it took to dig, drag, blast and

402
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:32,617
tunnel one's way up this
route back in the day.

403
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,920
Back in the beginning, making

404
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,521
the trip required a somewhat

405
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,588
uncomfortable three-day trek up

406
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,927
the mountain by foot or horse or

407
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:47,132
hand-carried pelanguin.

408
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:50,035
The stats are impressive.

409
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:57,075
The climb of around 5,000 feet,

410
00:27:57,076 --> 00:28:01,713
over 100 tunnels, more than 800

411
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,281
Bridges, an engineering feat, a

412
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:10,088
job that when you consider
the time, defies imagining.

413
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:15,060
In the building of this
railroad, many died.

414
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:19,031
Many, many died.

415
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:18,389
When you look at that
painting, when you stand out

416
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:24,362
front of the garden and look out

417
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:28,566
at the view, can you
picture the way it was?

418
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:35,040
I have been to many places
where it reminded me of what

419
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,207
it's like to be when the British

420
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:40,745
came and settled there.

421
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:47,986
I have ventured to such places.

422
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:53,859
Fond memories of British rule,
maybe not what you would

423
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,326
expect to hear.

424
00:29:55,327 --> 00:30:00,031
But Reggie's family
was different.

425
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:04,535
Indian royalty with
palaces, the 1% of the 1%.

426
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,538
So life for Reggie as a young

427
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,706
boy was relative to the millions

428
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:16,707
and millions of others
his age, enchanted.

429
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:26,357
Shimla is from a time before
partition, when nearly the

430
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,727
entire ruling class of British
India would move to hill

431
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:37,728
stations in the hotter months.

432
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:42,707
Shimla was once known as the

433
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,276
queen of all hill stations.

434
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:51,449
Here, the colonials created
England in miniature.

435
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,154
Complete with Tudor
architecture, Rose gardens,

436
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:59,991
afternoon tea.

437
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:07,992
My grandfather
entertained hugely.

438
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:16,134
Garden parties, fancy dress
balls, elephant hunts.

439
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:25,850
The remnants of British
rule can still be seen.

440
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:30,855
And felt.

441
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:35,826
This is particularly
true of one house.

442
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,829
Chapsley.

443
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,666
My family was very fortunate

444
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:44,169
that they were able to buy this

445
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,836
house, because it
was a famous house.

446
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,772
The house was purchased by

447
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:53,711
Reggie's grandfather,
the last maharajah.

448
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:58,616
The Brits really left
beautiful buildings.

449
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,852
From a distance, it looks
much the same as it must have

450
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:09,360
when the maharajah slept here.

451
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:17,361
Check out the tub.

452
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,879
Locked in a constant battle

453
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,049
against time and nature, barbed

454
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,683
wire does little to keep

455
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:40,684
Shimla's ever encroaching
monkey population at bay.

456
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,601
Stripped of their wealth and

457
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:51,936
their kingdoms, the one-time

458
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,504
royals all across India have had

459
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,240
to either sell their estates or

460
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,242
like Reggie, turn them into

461
00:32:57,243 --> 00:33:05,243
hotels and guest houses
in order to hold on.

462
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:13,091
Ring a buzzer and a
servant appears.

463
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,525
They bring you hot water bottles

464
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:19,897
at night, put them
under the covers.

465
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:27,898
Butlers keep popping
in, build a nice fire.

466
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:34,212
A great facet of my childhood
was how my grandfather

467
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:34,513
entertained.

468
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,447
His table came to be known as

469
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,782
perhaps the most famous in

470
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:45,783
northern India because he
was a conoisseur of food.

471
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,294
Tonight, dinner at Chapslee,

472
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:54,732
an elaborate Anglo-Indian
menu from Reggie's childhood.

473
00:33:54,733 --> 00:34:02,407
I will put on my apron first.

474
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:06,144
My fellow guests, two
of Reggie's friends.

475
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:13,084
A historian on the subject
of Shimla and the barrister.

476
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,485
So much history here.

477
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:17,322
While I take a dim view of

478
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:18,423
colonialization, it's very hard

479
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:21,426
to resist the charms
of a house like this.

480
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:24,429
That's quite
understandable, actually.

481
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,698
You've got 100 years of very,

482
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,468
very intense history funneled
into a very small place.

483
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:38,469
This house used to house
the secretary of state.

484
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:48,179
This is eggs Florentine.

485
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,657
Oh, that's good.

486
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,159
This was a small town.

487
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:00,030
Small town with a very,
very big government.

488
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:06,737
It has the distinction of

489
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:07,673
surprisingly, it was the capital

490
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:08,973
of Burma during the war days.

491
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,675
You have this tiny little

492
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:11,809
village up on the hill connected

493
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,381
to the rest of the world by a

494
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:20,518
narrow mountain path and a rule,

495
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,387
approximately a fifth of the

496
00:35:21,388 --> 00:35:22,887
human race for eight
months every year.

497
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:28,693
In today's context it would
almost seem bizarre.

498
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:31,596
Mulligitawny soup.

499
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,198
A classic example of what we

500
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,266
think of as Indian food in
the west but not at all.

501
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,834
This was originally a soup made

502
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,436
by Indian chefs to accommodate

503
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:39,570
British tastes, is that correct?

504
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:47,345
It was something what you
would call halfway between a

505
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:53,518
soup and a broth.

506
00:35:53,519 --> 00:36:00,625
Basically, meat cooked
in its own fat.

507
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:01,959
It's a misnomer.

508
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,865
This meat is not
actually mutton.

509
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:08,966
Here, back before the rail

510
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,901
line, it would be
a difficult trip.

511
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:11,136
Yes.

512
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:14,104
But once they were up and
running, there were many

513
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,606
servants to look after
your every need.

514
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:20,278
You had a fireplace, a
hearth in every room.

515
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:28,279
And people on the regular
payroll whose only job was to

516
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:35,626
Is this man would go on the

517
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:40,298
ground and the common
folk would get real.

518
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,099
Normally they would not supposed

519
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,301
to look in the direction.

520
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:43,735
It was bad manners.

521
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:45,303
Right.

522
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:49,974
It wasn't easy for the
people who built it.

523
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:52,142
It was India that paid the bill

524
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:58,816
for all this grandeur
for all this show.

525
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,985
They did it at our expense
and with our money.

526
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,854
At the end of the meal,
there's coffee, Brandy and

527
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:04,975
cigars in the sitting radio.

528
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:14,292
As one does, or once did.

529
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:22,172
Did you enjoy your time?

530
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,108
Very much so.

531
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:27,945
A lot of his are in this house.

532
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:29,647
And one can be forgiven for

533
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,682
briefly forgetting what it took

534
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:37,522
to build this lost kingdom.

535
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:43,429
And how much the world
has changed around it.

536
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:13,057
The monkey temple is
overrun by its namesakes.

537
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:15,426
Twisting up further into the

538
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:16,395
Himalayas, I find myself at a

539
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:19,864
place known as the
land of the gods.

540
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,098
Nearly every village credited

541
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:29,099
with having its own deity.

542
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,842
Getting there, you might well

543
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,011
have an opportunity to
meet one of those deities.

544
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:36,046
As you tear around narrow

545
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:39,016
guardrail free mountain roads,

546
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:43,588
overlooking terrifying dropoffs.

547
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:45,356
I can do heights.

548
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:48,426
I've done a number of jumping

549
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:51,529
out of the planes a
number of times.

550
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:56,401
But looking over precipices
like that one, ew.

551
00:38:56,402 --> 00:39:02,206
If my knees could vomit
with terror, they would be.

552
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,442
They would be vomiting
with terror right now.

553
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:06,777
They should have little
underwear stops on this road

554
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,045
where you can get a fresh pair.

555
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:14,952
Every couple of miles it's
like oh, that was scary.

556
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:18,222
Overloaded buses, water trucks

557
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:21,392
with brake pads, aggressive
truck drivers come whaling

558
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:22,927
around the corner at anytime.

559
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:25,963
And they do.

560
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:26,932
About every two minutes.

561
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:34,933
Squeeze your cheeks tight
and close your eyes.

562
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,579
The remote locations of these

563
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:46,584
isolated mountain villages have

564
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:49,987
kept old traditions alive.

565
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,757
Villa village fairs serve as an

566
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:55,860
opportunity for families who
live very far apart to get

567
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:59,163
together, play game, eat and

568
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:06,170
participate in religious rites
honoring local deities.

569
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,638
Quite a ride getting here.

570
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,106
Yeah.

571
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:09,440
How did you enjoy that road?

572
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:12,042
White knuckles.

573
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,944
Meet Hashim.

574
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:21,945
He runs motorcycle tours
through these parts.

575
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:28,493
You're traveling almost 1,000
kilometers on the trip.

576
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:30,995
So vegetable curry?

577
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:35,466
Yogurt based curry, quite
typical in these parts.

578
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:36,134
Vegetables again?

579
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:38,869
Surprisingly, not a problem.

580
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,738
That's good, huh?

581
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,138
This is one of the few places in

582
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,473
the world I could eat vegetarian

583
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:44,408
every day and still be happy.

584
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,811
Most of the people in this
community are farmers?

585
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,145
Farmers.

586
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,246
Agricultural?

587
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:49,681
Yeah.

588
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:50,715
What are they growing?

589
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:55,185
A lot of corn, potatoes, peas.

590
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:58,355
And weed.

591
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,257
People grow marijuana?

592
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,258
Yes, loads.

593
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:01,893
For export or personal use?

594
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:02,494
Everything.

595
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:04,562
A mix of everything.

596
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,931
So you think you want to
go check out the fair?

597
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,966
Yeah, let's take a walk through
town, see what's going

598
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:14,338
on.

599
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:20,344
Families come together
and socialize.

600
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:20,979
People are busy in their farms.

601
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:21,713
They're not going to walk down

602
00:41:21,714 --> 00:41:24,014
and socialize with people.

603
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,584
But this, you know, because it's

604
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:28,886
Autumn, everyone is done
with all the agriculture.

605
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:31,956
Now they're just baring
down for winter.

606
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:37,862
A lot of romance in the air.

607
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:45,863
I've been to Mumbai, this is

608
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:49,373
a part of India that's
different than any other part.

609
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:57,374
It's fascinating and beautiful.

610
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,117
Oh, yeah.

611
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:08,118
Sweet.

612
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:16,667
♪

613
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:24,668
Whoa, it's moving.

614
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:34,344
♪

615
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,258
End of the road.
