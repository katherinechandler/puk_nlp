for us, for me and for him, here

189
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:54,700
is a place where many
people have suffered.

190
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,269
There is still one kind of Karma

191
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,138
of this old history
here, you know?

192
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:07,139
So what is the real pellorinio?

193
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,451
We are.

194
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:17,790
We are.

195
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:42,141
I don't like pina coladas

196
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,809
but I like walking in the rain.

197
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,876
I like wandering through markets

198
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,479
as much as the next guy, but

199
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,817
what I really like
are neuro toxins.

200
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,220
In Japan, they call it fugu.

201
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:58,424
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's eyes,

202
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,692
ovaries and internal organs are

203
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,494
packed with varying amounts of

204
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,929
toxins and some people will tell

205
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,397
you the toxin present in the

206
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,166
blowfish is 1200 times more

207
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,236
potent than cyanide and they
will tell you how if it's

208
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,403
consumed, you remain conscious

209
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,871
while your muscles gradually

210
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,340
become paralyzed and death, like

211
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:17,943
a slow-moving freight train,
moves closer and closer.

212
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,945
And whatever you do, just make

213
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:24,416
sure you cut out that liver.

214
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:29,688
I say bull... So we're
eating blowfish.

216
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:30,357
Yes.

217
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:31,423
It's an adventure.

218
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,960
Like the Japanese,
they like the poisons?

219
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,096
No I know, I know, yeah.

220
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,930
They remove the
liver and the skin?

221
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,032
Supposed to be removed properly.

222
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,434
Properly, right.

223
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,936
I saw a "Simpsons"
episode, I think.

224
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,106
This guy make it great.

225
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:52,611
Poisonous blowfish
will take a recipe.

226
00:16:52,612 --> 00:17:00,612
Add coriander, coconut
milk, cover and simmer.

227
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,623
I am confident in this
cook I don't know.

228
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:10,962
And in this man, my host and
aficionado of this dish.

229
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,598
Smelling good.

230
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,500
Bon appetit.

231
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:22,308
Thank you.

232
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,076
This is a lot of pepper, huh?

233
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:24,744
Oh, yeah.

234
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,078
Good pepper.

235
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,413
Nice and spicy.

236
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:27,914
I can't feel my legs.

237
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:33,252
Is that a bad thing?

238
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,087
Bel is an artist, after all.

239
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,923
A very famous one.

240
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,159
So he knows about neurotoxins.

241
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,260
He comes from a long tradition

242
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:48,100
of artists who have found
inspiration in Bahia.

243
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,137
Is there something about
Salvador you think that's

244
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,738
conducive to an
artistic sensibility?

245
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,208
There is so much color
here and music.

246
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,043
The light here is beautiful.

247
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:59,278
The light is really special.

248
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,713
Just the colors of the
city are amazing.

249
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,315
The colors of the people are

250
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,617
amazing, and the way they move.

251
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,052
They move.

252
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,053
I don't know, when I first

253
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,787
came here, I thought everybody

254
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:12,224
in this city looks like they

255
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:20,225
just got or they're on their
way to go...

256
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,205
So this was the central

257
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,306
market back before supermarkets,

258
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,475
this is where everybody did
their shopping, right?

259
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,511
Oh, yes.

260
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,045
This is the real Brazil here.

261
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:34,414
The real Bahia.

262
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:38,650
Right.

263
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:43,989
This place is fantastic.

264
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,494
They sell oil and stuff,
this kind of oil, palm oil.

265
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,761
Oh, yeah.

266
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:50,896
Whoever you want to call it.

267
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,531
I love the dende oil.

268
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:53,732
It takes some getting used to.

269
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,067
The first time I was here, you

270
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:01,072
eat it, you... like a mink
for hours afterwards.

271
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:01,674
Now, no problems.

272
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,509
I've been eating this all week.

273
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,010
Love it.

274
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:12,011
You spend time in Brazil
you develop resistance.

275
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,355
There you go.

276
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,789
Hope you like spicy.

277
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,725
He's a Brazilian guy.

278
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:26,726
He's got to like spicy.

279
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:27,934
A little cachaca.

280
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:33,239
Oh, yes.

281
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,208
That will set you right.

282
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:44,209
That will protect you
from the poison.

283
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,226
We're coming up to the world

284
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,427
cup and I know a lot of people

285
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,796
will be reading about
crime and all that.

286
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,765
How do you think it's going
to go, the world cup?

287
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,900
Disaster or it's going
to somehow work out?

288
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,669
I think it will be a success.

289
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,136
You think it will be a success.

290
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,072
I'm sure of it.

291
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,274
Salvador is one of the host

292
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:10,576
cities for the 2014 world cup.

293
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,811
A huge stadium has recently been

294
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,681
completed, but a lot of people

295
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,783
are worried, concerned,
if Brazil is ready.

296
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:21,420
I have been told thousands
of prostitutes are studying

297
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,088
tourist-appropriate languages in

298
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:23,856
preparation, so probably a lot

299
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:25,424
of people are going to get laid,

300
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,958
a lot of people are going to get

301
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,026
robbed, a lot of people are

302
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:31,363
going to get laid and robbed.

303
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,632
Have you ever been
here in carnival?

304
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:37,168
No.

305
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,770
The world cup is that carnival.

306
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,439
That works out, right?

307
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,940
That's not a slaughterfest.

308
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,710
It's a breakfast.

309
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:45,211
Right.

310
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:46,445
Things happen but it works.

311
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:52,017
Salvador in particular is
a place where... may I?

312
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:52,352
Thank you.

313
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:54,853
No matter what,
people should come.

314
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,822
Even people who are afraid to

315
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,458
travel, who say oh,
well, but I hear.

316
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,328
No, you know what,
live your life, man.

317
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,162
You should not miss a place like

318
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:04,964
this, because there aren't a lot

319
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:10,969
of places in the world that
even come close to this.

320
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:17,809
Where we are today, I invited
you to have this dish.

321
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,313
We are not born to die.

322
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:24,983
I'm pretty sure Mr. Muffin
stuff over here is suddenly

323
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:28,019
going to jump on me,
start clawing my face.

324
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,188
The poison was
active, she's dead.

325
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:33,224
I didn't think of that.

326
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,594
We call you canary.

327
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:36,329
We are not born for dying.

328
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,866
No.

329
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:55,674
The bay of all saints, a
vast natural harbor allowed

330
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:56,775
Salvador to prosper.

331
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:57,843
Tucked along its shore, if you

332
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,277
look hard enough, you'll find a

333
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:07,278
small grouping of shacks
roofed in corrugated tin.

334
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,622
This is where a local
fishermen's association brings

335
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,924
their catch to sell to
wholesalers, then relax after a

336
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:16,094
long day on the water.

337
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:21,032
Catch of the day, the
prized big red snapper.

338
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,202
Rub with sea salt, lemon, olive

339
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,171
oil, grill over charcoal.

340
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:30,308
Enjoy view.

341
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:36,949
So everybody here is fishermen?

342
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,652
Meet Maloca, a very special guy.

343
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,788
He's been working as our head of

344
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,289
security and as for reasons that

345
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,658
are immediately obvious, he

346
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:50,361
enjoys respect and
reputation on the streets.

347
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,663
But he also comes out of this

348
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,164
neighborhood and these
guys are his friends.

349
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,801
How's business now?

350
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:56,636
Lot of fish out there?

351
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:59,806
Fishing business good?

352
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,056
Lunch wouldn't be complete

353
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,858
without a delicious spicy salsa

354
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,928
of garlic, tomato,
onions and peppers.

355
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:27,232
On the side, some deep
fried little smelts.

356
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,701
Don't forget the beer and
the cachaca and enjoy.

357
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,037
That will work.

358
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,740
Looks like a big grouper.

359
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:42,741
It's a big redfish.

360
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:48,386
I have to advise you
that... it's spicy.

361
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,855
What do they drink,
beer or cachaca?

362
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:57,856
Both.

363
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:09,241
Still working?

364
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:20,111
He work more than all of us.

365
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:24,455
They use a line or net?

366
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,957
A line.

367
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,226
My secret is just the hand

368
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:32,731
around a piece of wood like
that and take like that.

369
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,966
They don't cut the hands?

370
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:38,303

The magic ingredient, cachaca.

That's basically the distilled

When millions of Africans

were taken by force to Brazil,

the traditions, the musical

446
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,139
roots they had, instruments they

447
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,809
played, their gods and
their food came with them.

448
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,378
In the days of slavery, you

449
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,513
would hide that stuff, whether

450
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:35,586
it was your religion or
your self-defense skills.

451
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:39,257
So tell me about kapuara.

452
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:40,992
It was a kind of martial art

453
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:42,393
but in the beginning of the

454
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,495
century, it became more like a

455
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:52,496
game and the music
instruments were associated.

456
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:01,412
No hats, right?

457
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,114
Why no hands?

458
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:05,183
We use the hands in
just a few movements.

459
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,018
Where did that come from and

460
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:07,886
why do you think that became...

461
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:12,957
Some people say that this
is inspired by the animal

462
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:13,225
movements.

463
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:16,194
In a recent study observing
the comparative destructive

464
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:17,862
power between kicks from various

465
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:22,900
martial arts, of karate, muy

466
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:26,971
Thai and tie Kwan Doe, capuara

467
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,639
packed the most
ferocious impact.

468
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,874
The leaders knew this and made

469
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:35,213
it illegal for much
of Brazil's history.

470
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:38,816
Today, it's taught in
classrooms and on stages.

471
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,252
Originally it was a
male-dominated activity.

472
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,221
When did that change?

473
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:48,559
Since the '60s.

474
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,794
We start in the beginning of the

475
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:53,564
'80s and nowadays, we have
hundreds of women practice.

476
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,501
What was it like in the
beginning, the very first women

477
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:58,069
who did it?

478
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,306
Mothers or fathers or
the family... right.

479
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:03,674
Sad that capuara is not for

480
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:07,912
women, why do you
decide to do this.

481
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,580
Afro Brazilian cuisine is the

482
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:10,948
result of many, many years of

483
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:14,252
cooks experimenting with African

484
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,586
and Portuguese dishes combined

485
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,088
with local ingredients like

486
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,757
seafood, chilies, coconut milk.

487
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,692
This is Angelica's house.

491
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:27,199
Wow.

492
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,766

493
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:34,639
Looks very good.

494
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,609
How has being a master of
capuara, how has that changed

495
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,944
the rest of your life?

496
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:42,847
I think changed it a lot.

497
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:47,152
Women in general, they
don't learn to fight.

498
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:49,720
Learning how to be involved in

499
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,389
real fights, game and fight at

500
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,224
the same time, we became more

501
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:57,995
prepared to be involved in
symbolic fight and in our

502
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,997
society, the women, they are not

503
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:07,998
so well prepared like men.

504
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,847
It was purely African in the
beginning, and now it's

505
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,350
Afro-Brazilian form,
is that correct?

506
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,018
All the instruments are
African instruments.

507
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,020
Right.

508
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:23,589
They're singing.

509
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,490
A lot of singing,
and it's important.

510
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,891
Yeah.

511
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:27,159
Yeah.

512
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,998
In Portuguese, but we in
capuara, we start to include

513
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:38,703
music from multi-cultural
African cultural traditions

514
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:45,243
including lyrics in
African language.

515
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,077
All the things that we look

516
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:51,081
at as Brazilian from outside

517
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,052
looking in, the cuisine, samba,

518
00:35:55,053 --> 00:36:00,391
all of these things are
very African in origin.

519
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:03,361
This is kind of where
that all started, yes?

520
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:05,363
I mean, I don't want to
say it's the real Brazil.

521
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:07,265
Everyone looks at Rio as the

522
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:10,368
postcard Brazil, but here
it's really, you feel it.

523
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,938
Those things.

524
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,773
It has to do with this big

525
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:19,944
concentration of Africans
since the beginning.

526
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:26,552
It's different.

527
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,521
If you, say, found yourself

528
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:38,188
in Brazil and had a chance to

529
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,524
hire a boat, head for the beach

530
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:45,162
with a bunch of new friends,
bring along a skilled

531
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:50,167
mixologist, expertly trained in

532
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:53,237
the arts of drink making,
why wouldn't you?

533
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,705
Charge across the water, headed

534
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,308
for a nice, quiet island.

535
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:00,311
Order up some sun to come out

536
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:07,151
from some dark clouds
right about now.

537
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:10,421
Sometimes cliches are
cliches for a reason.

538
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,390
Because they're good ideas to

539
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:14,224
start with, which is why people

540
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:22,225
keep looking for them and
doing them over and over.

541
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:57,602
In a perfect world upon
reaching said enchanted island,

542
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:59,370
you jump into the warm Atlantic

543
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:00,538
water, and if you could, you

544
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:01,972
would have a classic soundtrack

545
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:09,973
to this adventure, like
samba, for instance.

546
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,549
Splash around for a while, maybe

547
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:16,887
enjoy a nice cold beer or two.

548
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,723
You truly have not taken a

549
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:26,130
beach until a man has set
up the Caporina station.

550
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:33,571
Then you know the lz is secure.

551
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,773
I love nature.

552
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:43,748
Oh what's going on here?

553
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:46,851
Capoirina.

554
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:47,085
Please.

555
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:48,986
Sweet.

556
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,421
This alone is an argument for

557
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:57,762
the greatness of this country.

558
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,930
And what goes great with
drinks on the beach?

559
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:07,931
How about some barbecue?

560
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,320
Please, don't eat me.

561
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,455
Look in your heart.

562
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:25,356
Don't eat me.

563
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:25,624
Oh, no.

564
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:33,397
Not my head.

565
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:36,233
To complete the picture,
make a large fish.

566
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:36,802
Maybe some crab.

567
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:42,339
You know, anytime you get your

568
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,709
Chinese, Brazilians and Italians

569
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,076
all agreeing on something, it's

570
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,978
really clear it's a good idea.

571
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:51,982
Everybody agrees this complic
complicated creature with

572
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,183
troublesome shells
is worth the work.

573
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,519
Tear off the little limbs.

574
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,487
We'll get to you a little
later, my friends.

575
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:57,488
Rip out the tail.

576
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,724
These are the lungs
you don't want them.

577
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:03,894
Now you've got all this
nice fat in there.

578
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:04,496
Oh, yeah.

579
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:06,531
Now we're getting to the claw.

580
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:08,165
Look at that.

581
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:15,506
Let's poke him out of there.

582
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:15,774
Oh, yeah.

583
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:17,775
That little melon of goodness.

584
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:22,913
Like a celestial nibble.

585
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,782
When people started demanding

586
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:30,087
boneless stuff like chicken
without a bone or crab meat

587
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,388
without the actual crab.

588
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:32,389
Or lazy lobster.

589
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,224
That was the beginning of the

590
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,626
erosion of our society
as we know it.

591
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:36,761
If you're not willing to work

592
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:38,529
for a payoff like this, how do

593
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,099
you expect us to, like, fight Al

594
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,870
qaeda if you can't suck
the meat out of a crab?

595
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:47,071
Character builder.

596
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:52,242
And delicious.

597
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,479
And if your perfect day
really did happen, you would

598
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:03,220
probably let yourself
be swept away.

599
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:06,924
By liquor and good food and gin

600
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:10,795
clear water, all all around you,

601
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:12,963
Brazilians casually fondle each

602
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:17,736
other, get all dozy
and fall asleep.
