1
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:10,810
My great fear is a
fear of failing.

2
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,312
And that's Hawaiian because I

3
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:15,115
was born that way because
that's expectation.

4
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:17,650
You're Hawaiian, you're
going to be less.

5
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,386
You're Hawaiian, you're
going to feel more.

6
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:19,887
It's old.

7
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:20,221
It's in you.

8
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:21,689
It's part of your identity.

9
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:29,462
But when I navigate a voyage, I

10
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,630
know when the storm comes, it's

11
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:35,001
going to take you to the bone.

12
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:38,738
And if the storm keeps coming,
you've got to stand up.

13
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,740
That's just what
you've got to do.

14
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,410
It's this zone where you learn
to make fear your best friend.

15
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:47,414
You hold it really close to you
and you open up the door to

16
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:49,217
believing that you can make it.

17
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:58,258

this beautiful world ♪

18
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:05,098

♪ sha la la la la la la

25
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,468
Hawaii is America.

26
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:46,306
As American as anything
could possibly be.

27
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,342
Yet also never shed what was
there before in the layers and

28
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,512
layers that have come since.

29
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:58,551
It's a wonderful tricky
conflicted mutant in lack of a

30
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,421
better word you'd have
to call paradise.

31
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,856
No man's paradise.

32
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,426
Paradises don't exist.

33
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,927
Paradise is kind
of in your head.

34
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:08,428
Wait a minute.

35
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,862
You look at your window here.

36
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,832
You look at those hills, those

37
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:18,838
mountains, all that
green, that blue sky.

38
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,240
The clear sea.

39
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,675
It sure looks like
paradise to me.

40
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:23,743
This guy knows.

41
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,547
He's been everywhere.

42
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,583
He's Paul Theru.

43
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,019
He's a legendary travel writer.

44
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,354
Of the all the places he's been,

45
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:37,757
all the places he's seen, he
chose Hawaii to live and he's

46
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:41,194
lived here for 25 years.

47
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,129
Does it matter
that it's America?

48
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,265
It's the big thing
that it's America.

49
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:48,701
It has elements of
the third world.

50
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,738
The nicest elements of the third

51
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,307
world which is the
self-respect, the pride.

52
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,043
Things that don't work at all.

53
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,878
And then it's USA.

54
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,547
Where we are now.

55
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:01,814
There's PTA meetings here.

56
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:07,420
They get together and watch the
super bowl and it's the most

57
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:15,061
main street USA you will find.

58
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,765
Town is a neighborhood spot in
the district and as Hawaii is

59
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:23,270
the only state in the union that
allows fishermen to sell to

60
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:27,574
restaurants, the pan-roasted
mahi-mahi is pretty damn good.

61
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,942
It's not a particularly
welcoming or friendly part of

62
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,411
the world.

63
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,513
Contrary to the sort
of the aloha myth.

64
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,248
No, that's right.

65
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,417
But no island is.

66
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,251
Nantucket isn't.

67
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,953
The island of Hawaii isn't.

68
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:48,954
An island that, want
foreigners there?

69
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,432
Sicily.

70
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,434
Did anyone come to an island
with a good intention?

71
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:59,339
No, never in this new world.

72
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,342
Best case in the world,
bring syphilis.

73
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:02,643
Pretty much.

74
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:03,043
At the very least.

75
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:03,444
Yes.

76
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:06,145
Captain cook put his sailors

77
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:10,883
ashore just to look
northwest of here.

78
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,851
The first.

79
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,120
Hawaii killed its first tourist.

80
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:18,458
Philippines killed their first
tourist but people on the

81
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,726
islands born on the islands.

82
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,381
View anyone who comes
ashore with suspicion.

83
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,636
What defines a Hawaiian?

84
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:33,906
Maybe should go back in our
imaginations to could have been

85
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:34,574
2,000 years ago.

86
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:37,910
The Tahitians had this voyage

87
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:44,484
way before any other culture
was exploring the deep seas.

88
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,818
Somehow, someplace in the south

89
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:53,760
pacific, single most
isolated in the planet.

90
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,428
Fast forward to captain cook and

91
00:04:55,429 --> 00:05:00,900
get a glimpse, very
productive people.

92
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:01,834
They're industrious, healthy.

93
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,370
For the arts.

94
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:06,005
That was a large population,
more than half of what we have

95
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,273
in Hawaii today.

96
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,542
Fully sustainable, because
there was no other choice.

97
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:14,080
So over time, the native
Hawaiian population goes to

98
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:14,348
22,000.

99
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:18,184
It's the same story.

100
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:22,288
Introduced, the inability to
deal with it, people die.

101
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,191
1926, public school system would

102
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,394
outlaw language and the practice

103
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,729
of culture in public schools.

104
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,064
So extinctions well paid.

105
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:39,105
Between captain cook's
arrival in 1778 and today,

106
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,641
disease wiped out most
of the population.

107
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,241
Missionaries came.

108
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:46,913
A booming sugar and pineapple
plantation industry.

109
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:50,817
Influx of immigrants in Okinawa,

110
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:53,553
China, and the Philippines,
the overthrow.

111
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,956
And the U.S. takeover of
the Hawaiian government.

112
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:57,957
World war ii.

113
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,194
And finally, statehood.

114
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,303
The geographical realities of
being thousands of miles from,

115
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,641
well, anywhere else, has
given Hawaii to some degree,

116
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:16,409
protection from the forces that

117
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,680
eradicated so many other south
pacific cultures entirely.

118
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:24,917
In fact, they've arguably been
holding back the inevitable

119
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,386
better than just about anyone.

120
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,426
What Hawaii looks like today
depends which island you're

121
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:34,961
standing on and to some extent,

122
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,096
the reputation of the locals.

123
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:42,301
The Hawaiian islands
are not a monolith.

124
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,003
Islands, that's plural and we're

125
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:48,775
talking eight very different
islands with very different

126
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:49,109
identities.

127
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,279
It's been over a century since
the waves of immigrants began

128
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,182
and things got all mixed up
in the best possible way.

129
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,016
There's layers.

130
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:00,553
And a simple question like, who

131
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,791
is Hawaiian gets you
all kinds of answers.

132
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,728
The neighborhood of Kalihi is

133
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,531
far from what most know and most

134
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,533
specific kind the last 40 years.

135
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,234
It's the blue collar town.

136
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,236
They all come here.

137
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,370
Breakfast, lunch.

138
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:18,971
Every day.

139
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:25,512
I'm joined by two local chefs,
Mark Maguchi of mission,

140
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,680
known by some as the gooch.

141
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,817
Second generation
Japanese and Andrew.

142
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,920
He's first generation Vietnamese
American or would that be

143
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:34,721
Vietnamese Hawaiian?

144
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:37,724
As you'll see, it
gets complicated.

145
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,158
I actually cooked on the east

146
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,392
coast for three years and people

147
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,062
would always be like,
are you from Hawaii?

148
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:43,830
You're Hawaiian?

149
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:48,735
I said, no.

150
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:49,002
Japanese.

151
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:50,436
But Hawaiian?

152
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:55,742
No, I realized like, here in
Hawaii, we identify ourselves

153
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,210
ethnically versus
geographically.

154
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,513
No way we would call
ourselves Hawaiians.

155
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:06,919
We would get our asses
kicked by a Hawaiian.

156
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,854
Who is Hawaiian?

157
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,856
A native of the land.

158
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,057
In your blood.

159
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:14,594
You come from a lineage of
native Hawaiian people.

160
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,762
What's here?

161
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:20,600
I feel like Hawaiian
in a sense, you know.

162
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,601
It's my place.

163
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,435
But culturally, that's
a different story.

164
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,037
You say you're not Hawaiian.

165
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,205
No.

166
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:32,378
What's your feeling about
so you're Hawaiian.

167
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:40,379
I'm born and raised,
going to die 808.

168
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:49,729
Aka mob, mainly Japanese
husband, and daughter, who I

169
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,433
guess would be Japanese,
Okinawan/Hawaiian and

170
00:08:54,434 --> 00:09:00,339
son-in-law, Robert, who
is of course, Mexican.

171
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:00,741
That's pretty.

172
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:03,075
Ooh, look at that.

173
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,946
That looks good.

174
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:12,852
Now we are talking.

175
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,520
That's awesome.

176
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:18,791
I just caught local food.

177
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:23,262
When I look at this
table, it's just Hawaii.

178
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:27,366
Got Portuguese, Japanese.

179
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,602
Okinawa Okinawan, world war ii.

180
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:29,937
I don't know.

181
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:30,937
Korea?

182
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:37,443
Korean, Japanese, Hawaiian.

183
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:37,778
Awesomeness.

184
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,180
The food is bone deep Hawaiian
stuff, which is to say

185
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,682
delicious mash-up, okay.

186
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:43,850
Take taco rice.

187
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:51,851
It's a dish created in Okinawa
to approximate Tex-Mex

188
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:58,297
appropriated by younger
generations of Okinawan and

189
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,633
Japanese found its
way back to Hawaii.

190
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,368
Got that?

191
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:05,471
Identify, my best friends
were native Hawaiian.

192
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:09,909
Helped me to realize the
pride of being from Hawaii,

193
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,577
understanding the
Hawaiian culture.

194
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,145
Living it.

195
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:13,913
Possibly Japanese.

196
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:17,684
There's still a
movement to sovereign.

197
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,819
There's strong movement.

198
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,657
So if fighting broke out,
which side are you on?

199
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,860
You don't have to
think about that.

200
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,762
I would joke about it.

201
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,699
If like, me and Hawaii.

202
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,335
I am back and uncle Sam and were

203
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,838
like, no, native Hawaiian only,
I'm like, everybody needs to

204
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:39,039
cook.

205
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,172
I'm a cook.

206
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,141
I have worth!

207
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,719
This is Ninoa Thompson.

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,720
In 1976 with similarly heroic
Hawaiians, he did a difficult

209
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,361
important thing.

210
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,931
Before 1972, it was generally

211
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:08,367
assumed even insisted upon
that Hawaii had been settled

212
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:12,204
originally by some random
savages who maybe drifted over

213
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:20,205
accidentally from south America.

214
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,387
Couldn't have been ancient
Polynesians across thousands of

215
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,623
miles of open water.

216
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:32,491
No dreams.

217
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,625
No hope.

218
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,306
Can't see.

219
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,971
They were set out to prove
that's what did happen.

220
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:48,440
There were those in the
community that loved this,

221
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:55,748
prayed for it.

222
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,316
It was powerful.

223
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:01,420
It changed everything.

224
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:06,125
The hokulaia.

225
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,426
A kind of craft believed to have

226
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:13,265
been used in those times
and only using primitive

227
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,967
contemporaneous navigational

228
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,203
tools sailed to Tahiti and back.

229
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:22,108
The trip that helped spark a
Hawaiian renaissance, a rebirth

230
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,877
of pride and interest in
traditional Hawaiian culture and

231
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:25,145
identity.

232
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:33,146
The success was monumental.

233
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,292
Changed the view of ancestors as

234
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:45,798
extraordinarily skilled
and so we come from them.

235
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,001
Thomas is a water man
who continues to sail.

236
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,371
Native Hawaii, his roots go
back in the valley 200 years.

237
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,507
My grandfather was born here.

238
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,392
So I grew up.

239
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:06,552
Spent many years learning
techniques from a master.

240
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:13,492
Now the small
Micronesian island.

241
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:17,163
He was put to be trained and
learning the wind and the water

242
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:25,164
and the zone, he was sailing.

243
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,710
The canoe make me sick, my
grandfather threw me into the

244
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:32,945
ocean to go inside the wave.

245
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:36,382
When I go inside the
wave, I become the wave.

246
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,919
When I become the
wave, now I navigate.

247
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,420
I approached him.

248
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,023
Said to me, too old?

249
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:48,360
You want someone to
know everything.

250
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,695
Send his son.

251
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,530
He said I'll teach you enough to

252
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:57,970
find the island you seek, but
I can't teach you the magic.

253
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:04,043
Why do you think it was
important to do such a thing?

254
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:08,247
The same story you'll see
everywhere in terms of the

255
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:08,881
indigenous people.

256
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,650
My father's mother, nearly pure

257
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,153
Hawaiian, chooses not to teach

258
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,223
her children language or
culture or genealogy.

259
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,224
Where do you come?

260
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,758
Who's your family?

261
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,562
What's your name, and that could
have been 100 generations.

262
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,298
What the voyage did was a
reconnection back to feeling

263
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:31,470
wholesome about who you are,
because knowing where you come

264
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:39,471
from and who are your ancestors.

265
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:40,980
This this wasn't.

266
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,582
It was symbolic.

267
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,816
A bumper sticker,
t-shirt emerged.

268
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,922
I'm proud to be Hawaiian.

269
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,289
1987, first language.

270
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,857
Mandatory in schools.

271
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:52,992
Has to be taught.

272
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:56,128
Private schools won't have
attendance if you don't teach

273
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:56,695
Hawaiian.

274
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,430
Now Hawaiian identity
into everything.

275
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:02,302
It has to be recognized
in everything.

276
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,476
That is powerful.

277
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:18,477
What I mentioned to people, is
in Ooahu, that I was going

278
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:25,824
Moliki, a lot were surprised.

279
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,827
They said the Malachi dudes were

280
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:33,799
mean, unfriendly, tough as iron
and quick to get pissed off.

281
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,602
As it turned out, that
was not my experience.

282
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:47,046
We like to brag that we
don't have traffic lights.

283
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,147
We only have traffic.

284
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,248
Nice.

285
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:54,086
Walter Naki is a skilled
fisherman and today, we head out

286
00:15:54,087 --> 00:16:00,892
for some octopus.

287
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:05,031
It's not the friendly island.

288
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:07,533
Supposed to be the most
unfriendly island.

289
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:12,571
Traditionally, we're
here very freely.

290
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:20,572
Now, unfreely is where you
go try to come and fix it.

291
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:29,114
That's when it
becomes unfriendly.

292
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,191
We had a lot still in tact.

293
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:32,724
Still?

294
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,760
Yes.

295
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,695
But there is always other
people that want to come.

296
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:40,432
Unsurprisingly, fishing rights
is an issue around here.

297
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,069
Don't come over here sport
fishing the wrong place if you

298
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:48,240
know what's good for you.

299
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:52,411
So this is the area.

300
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:52,712
Okay, ready?

301
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:53,346
Let's go.

302
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,697
We are here, man.

303
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:15,302
Culture.

304
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:17,903
We keep the feeling there, make

305
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,406
them feel, not going
to take no more.

306
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:25,777
Come right up, stick them.

307
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:30,316
Final step, stun the struggling
creature with a sharp

308
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:36,655
blow from the mallet or if you
want to go old school, fight

309
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,624
them right in the bray.

310
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,628
In my case, it took repeated

311
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:48,434
crunching for the
chicklet sized organ.

312
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:52,271
This one died eventually, likely

313
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:58,778
by exhaustion as anything
else, I suspected.

314
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,969
Hawaiian renaissance.

315
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,472
This is what really
set things off.

316
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,808
Beginning in 1941 continuing
into the '70s and beyond, the

317
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:36,982
U.S. Navy been using the
beautiful neighborhood island of

318
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:44,490
Kaloa as a bombing range.

319
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,325
People have never been happy

320
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,594
about it but emboldened by times

321
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,329
and recent events, a group of

322
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,165
young activists decided
to take a stand.

323
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,768
In 1976, there were a number of
attempted occupations of the

324
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,104
island in protest
of the bombing.

325
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,507
None more successful
than Walter.

326
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,909
He and fellow activist, Richard

327
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,778
Sawyer, sat on the island
and refused to leave.

328
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,779
Back over there.

329
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,851
Managing to evade pursuers just
over a month before finally

330
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:16,955
being arrested in jail.

331
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,390
The first here.

332
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,759
They emerged, of course, heroes.

333
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,195
And these protests went on to

334
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,297
inspire many others to
enjoy the movement.

335
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,434
Still alive when they happen.

336
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,468
I want to see.

337
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:35,741
And em body the independent
spirit and desire for Hawaiian

338
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,910
sovereignty that today
resonates across generations.

339
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,191
Welcome to supposedly the most
unwelcoming place in Hawaii.

340
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:08,908
♪

341
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:11,443
My name is Hanuhanu.

342
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,911
Nice to meet you.

343
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:13,912
Please come inside.

344
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:17,283
Aloha.

345
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:25,284
This is a shared community
space with a sacred history.

346
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:31,997
Hano Hano is the caretaker of
the fish pond and here is the

347
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,932
famous Walter Ritty.

348
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,535
Everyone knows how valuable
this is because we can see what

349
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,270
happened to the
rest of the island.

350
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,939
Essentially an old
school fish farm.

351
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,341
800 years old.

352
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,609
800 years old.

353
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:49,648
Modernizing one old idea and
an ancient idea simple as

354
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:50,849
feeding your community.

355
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,151
This, the island you're on, this

356
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,287
place could feed over a million
people back in the day.

357
00:20:55,288 --> 00:21:00,692
You hear the word again
and again on Molki.

358
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:01,627
I know.

359
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:05,331
Means land and translates
to that which feeds you.

360
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:13,332
Springs, mountains, rivers.

361
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,811
Fresh water from the
fast moving oceans met.

362
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,680
Early, sustainable
clean fish farms.

363
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,148
Something in modern times, we're

364
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:27,486
still struggling to figure out.

365
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,354
People think about us.

366
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:31,923
The true story, we have a place
of abundance and trying to

367
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:32,658
protect it.

368
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:36,194
Trying to protect all of these
things we've been trying to

369
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,864
protect for the last 30 years
and it's getting harder and

370
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:39,098
harder.

371
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:43,869
Every single one of these
Hawaiians over here, get enough

372
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,004
evidence that the state of
Hawaii, the department of

373
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,675
natural resources have
done a terrible job.

374
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,209
We're not even
looking for blame.

375
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,178
We're looking for an
agreement for today.

376
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,113
Right.

377
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,783
We all are going to be pono.

378
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,918
We're all going to be
righteous and good.

379
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,921
Our planet is in such bad shape

380
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:07,292
that being environmental,
being green is trending.

381
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,060
That's how Hawaiians
have always been.

382
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,296
Who gets to be Hawaiian?

383
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:14,533
Is it the question,
who is Hawaiian?

384
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,368
You can be Hawaiian.

385
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,036
Come on.

386
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,372
Don't now.

387
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:20,873
I have to be born here.

388
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:21,607
This is a different story.

389
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,375
I can give you the
best explanation.

390
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,412
You cannot be our blood.

391
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:32,418
You cannot be kanapa.

392
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,085
Hawaii is our nationality.

393
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,554
It matters so much, if you love

394
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,956
this place and you don't want to

395
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:44,630
develop it, destroy, abuse
it, we're on the same team.

396
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:50,235
If you, in this place as a
money-making vehicle for

397
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,903
yourself, we enemies.

398
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,408
Right, and it doesn't matter
what race, religion, what sex.

399
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:59,745
If you love this place and the

400
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:01,680
way we love it and our ancestors

401
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,983
loved it, oh, we can be more
than friends but we can be

402
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:05,584
family.

403
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:07,419
I'm going to aloha you.

404
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,254
Beautifully put.

405
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:09,422
Wow.

406
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:10,255
That's it.

407
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,208
Right on, bro.

408
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:26,772
Slow roasted pig,
grilled kala fish.

409
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:27,006
Cooked.

410
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:31,610
And of course, octopus.

411
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,545
Known as squid luau.

412
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,481
Fresh poi.

413
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:36,047
You've got to have it fresh.

414
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:36,715
Believe me.

415
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,617
Makes all the difference
in the world.

416
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:44,690
Fresh water snails called I
believe hihi vine harvested from

417
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:50,161
streams way up in the mountains.

418
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,397
Up in the mountain.

419
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:52,632
Squid.

420
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:53,799
That's octopus?

421
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,869
Oh.>up in the mountain.

422
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,070
Squid.

423
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,471
That's octopus?

424
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:58,971
Oh.>up in the mountain.

425
00:23:58,971 --> 00:23:59,171
Squid.

426
00:23:59,171 --> 00:23:59,572
That's octopus?

427
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:00,072
Oh. Up in the mountain.

428
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:00,306
Squid.

429
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:00,707
That's octopus?

430
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:00,873
Oh.

431
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:01,941
I recognize you.

432
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:09,348
♪

433
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:25,731
When somebody steals this, it's
easy for us to say, you're

434
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:27,265
stealing our stuff.

435
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:27,500
Right?

436
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:31,837
But all of this stuff is
dependent on what healthy

437
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,672
environment and Eco-system is.

438
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:37,375
Let me ask you just because
I'm a bit of a dick.

439
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,746
I have to ask.

440
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:41,412
All right.

441
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,849
So we have like 12 more beers.

442
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,554
And I pull out some nice suvi.

443
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:50,622
I would eat them.

444
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:54,425
Look, I would eat them.

445
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:58,096
That doesn't mean it's
what I feed my children.

446
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:01,199
Our culture made everything
we did the best of the best.

447
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:09,040
Hawaiians are the only one
that turned into poi.

448
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,476
We're doing the best.

449
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:17,448
Introduce Christianity to us,
we're going to do the best.

450
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,717
Our Christianity is
better than yours.

451
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,786
I love it.

452
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,821
So disappointed, no way live up

453
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:28,293
to your reputation, mean,
inward looking, hostile.

454
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:28,595
Admit it.

455
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:29,327
It's a calculated strategy.

456
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:32,430
It is.

457
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:36,467
And the message, if you're
watching this show, I hope your

458
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,436
heart is swelling
with admiration.

459
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,906
The bottom line,
don't come here.

460
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,208
Yeah!

461
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:20,311
The ocean is all around
for thousands of miles.

462
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,480
A humbling feeling knowing at

463
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:23,882
all times the ground upon which

464
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:26,451
you live and breathe is but a

465
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:29,120
tiny speck in the
middle of all this.

466
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:34,292
So in Hawaii, the water, man,
is an important distinct.

467
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,462
It expresses the shared
consensus you're able to handle

468
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:41,166
yourself in the ocean no
matter what it throws at you.

469
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:45,971
It implies you're capable
of almost mythical things.

470
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,874
The ability to live in the
water, handle many moves above

471
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:53,979
or below the surface.

472
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,648
Meet uncle Ross.

473
00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:01,987
A canoe-surfing legend and
generally accepting ambassador

474
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:03,655
of the aloha spirit.

475
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:07,525
He's offered to share the truly
ancient Hawaiian space found

476
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,129
only on the face of
a crashing wave.

477
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:32,851
Surfing, a life connected to
the ocean, just spending time

478
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:34,052
with family and friends on the

479
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:39,524
beach, some of the
cornerstones of Hawaiian life.

480
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,927
This is decent.

481
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:48,466
Tony, that's Kiola.

482
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,768
How are you?

483
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,737
Kiave.

484
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:52,204
Megan.

485
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:52,871
Hello.

486
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:55,306
Those are my two daughters.

487
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:58,609
This is my wife, Felicia.

488
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,445
Hi, how are you?

489
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,113
Come say hi.

490
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:02,881
Milton.

491
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:05,817
This is Milton.

492
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,953
How does everybody
know each other here?

493
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:09,955
We live on an island.

494
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:10,956
Everybody knows everybody.

495
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:13,825
Why do I even ask?

496
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:17,228
I think I met uncle
Ross through the water.

497
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,297
Surfing, we became like family.

498
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:23,134
He's like my dad.

499
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,502
My ohana.

500
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:30,508
Each and every weekend, Ross
can be found here with his

501
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:35,513
ohana, extended
family and friends.

502
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,414
Beautiful day.

503
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,183
Even when it's storming,
it's nice on the beach.

504
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,017
Yeah.

505
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:39,318
Yeah.

506
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:42,754
And we'll stay here until
that thing goes down.

507
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,756
Hits the horizon.

508
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:48,994
When the sun hits the horizon,
it's time to go home.

509
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:52,430
Maui is an island as beautiful
as it gets and sure,

510
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:55,533
it's got share of
portion-controlled cruise line

511
00:28:55,534 --> 00:29:02,207
entertainments, doled out
and digestible bites and

512
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:08,479
complementary Mai Tais but a
beloved institution like tasty

513
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,881
crust.

514
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:11,883
Local a place as
you're likely to find.

515
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:15,787
Daniel Akitahito will explain.

516
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:18,556
This is a situation I
can order for you.

517
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:21,292
I think we'll hook you up
with the local flavor.

518
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,293
Okay, I trust.

519
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:25,663
Raised on the big island,
he's a journalist.

520
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,665
First Hawaiian editor of a major

521
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,836
surf publication and founder of
the local contrast magazine.

522
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:34,973
Local culture is very much so
trying to point a finger at

523
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:39,644
anybody coming going,
hey, you don't belong.

524
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:43,048
Therein kind of lies a little
conflict we have of being a

525
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,015
modern day Hawaiian.

526
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:47,152
And I still think that's
something we forget about these

527
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:52,991
days is how educated and how
accepting our ancestors were.

528
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:56,561
It was always built on
incluesivity, aloha.

529
00:29:56,562 --> 00:30:00,899
Aloha is giving without
expecting anything in return.

530
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:06,938
You've got a Hawaiian
culture part of

531
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:11,176
populated the islands and the
local part of the plantation

532
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:11,510
lifestyle.

533
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:15,180
The Japanese, the Chinese, the

534
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,916
Koreans, Filipinos, Portuguese.

535
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:20,685
All can be explained
what's on your plate.

536
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,288
This is a prime example.

537
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,957
Behold.

538
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:29,560
The most identifiable and
essential feature of the plate

539
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,695
lunch is this.

540
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:37,202
A big scoop or two of white
rice and potato Mac salad.

541
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:40,438
There is nothing more Hawaiian

542
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:45,043
with protein or this hamburger
steak, like Patty drowned in

543
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:50,748
dark sinister
stinky shiny gravy.

544
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:54,319
Or voodoo nori with sesame seed.

545
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,486
That looks beautiful.

546
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,223
That's going to work.

547
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:58,756
All right.

548
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,658
Sit this right on
top of the rice.

549
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:01,060
Yep.

550
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:05,563
Get some of that
salad on there too.

551
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:13,564
Get the gravey on.

552
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:16,107
They're fundamentally local.

553
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:20,946
This food, the most delicious,
let's be honest, delicious.

554
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:23,081
This is not healthy eating.

555
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:26,517
We're kind of paying the price
for it right now in the

556
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:29,487
health of the state.

557
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,088
Which is terrible.

558
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:34,025
As I take a bite of a hamburger.

559
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:35,760
As I said, just so good.

560
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:40,031
If you really want to do Hawaii
right, you've got to get

561
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,432
that.

562
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:46,771
That's a power that Hawaii has
is that if you show aloha and

563
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:50,942
you give without asking, the Ina

564
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:55,546
is going to recognize it and
shower its blessings upon you.

565
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:58,483
So you think traditional
Hawaiian culture and lifestyle

566
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:02,120
has a chance against
the modern world?

567
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:02,787
I think so.

568
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:07,358
The beautiful part about my
ancestors is they realized there

569
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,362
was a limited number of
resources where they lived, so

570
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:14,799
they observed nature to the best

571
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
possible they could to figure

572
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,202
out what were the cycles and how

573
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:20,738
do we preserve this resource?

574
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,908
Hawaiian culture can teach the
whole world something that it

575
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,577
needs to know, that we
all live on an island.

576
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:30,848
And we are all part of
the same community.

577
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:35,954
Let's all show aloha to the Ina
and everybody else as well.

578
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:56,041
An extraordinary man
lives in this house.

579
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,675
Chef Gordon.

580
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,178
Long time resident on Maui.

581
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,112
Legendary talent manager.

582
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:06,584
Maybe you know some of the
people whose careers he's looked

583
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:07,753
after.

584
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:10,221
Alice Cooper.

585
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:10,456
Blondie.

586
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:11,222
Pink Floyd.

587
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:16,761
He was years ahead of
the chef explosion.

588
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,763
Shepherding emeril
through his career.

589
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:21,366
Great chefs like Roger.

590
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:26,037
Close to holiness
the Dalai lama.

591
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,139
Basically done everything with
everybody in every place.

592
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,141
I first got here 40 years ago.

593
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,043
I put one foot on the island and

594
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:34,212
I knew I was living here
the rest of my life.

595
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:37,815
Do you ever look out there
and it's wallpaper?

596
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,950
I say it out loud.

597
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:40,951
First words in the morning.

598
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,489
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

599
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:44,923
Every day.

600
00:33:44,924 --> 00:33:48,593
Chef is famously one of the
most generous and enthusiastic

601
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,928
of hosts, a more stand-up loyal

602
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,764
guy you could barely imagine
and no wonder they call the

603
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:57,902
documentary based on his
life "super Mitch."

604
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,071
That's how he's known
around the world.

605
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:04,609
Here, he's known that guy
who throws great parties.

606
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,413
Prep starts early.

607
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:16,087
With chef's friend, Julio, a
Maui-born and bred rancher with

608
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,588
help from Sheldon.

609
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:21,592
Middle of the night, in a
traditional emu is done filled

610
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,827
with lava rocks.

611
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:25,530
The fire allowed to burn down to

612
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,432
coals before the pig wrapped in

613
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:32,370
combination of banana leaves
and tea leaves is dropped in.

614
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:36,607
Okay, you guys ready
for the unveiling?

615
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:36,875
Hold on.

616
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:42,313
12 hours later, you dig it up
and well, it's party time.

617
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:45,616
What you've been saying is
you've been drinking steadily

618
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:46,317
since 5:00 this morning.

619
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:49,255
I didn't say, it didn't
come out of my mouth.

620
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,525
Behold.

621
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:58,229
The magnificence.

622
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,833
It's a very important
part of your childhood.

623
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,069
Dun dun.

624
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,237
Wow.

625
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:05,571
Look at that.

626
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:07,138
You just lift the
bones out by hand.

627
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:07,373
Yep.

628
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:10,808
Ready?

629
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,577
Just dump them in into a bucket.

630
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:13,122
Awesome.

631
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:18,316
Wow.

632
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:22,253
Wow.

633
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:25,691
That's pretty much the
way I want to end up.

634
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,326
Pour me into a pot.

635
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:31,762
There's lots to do and
everyone pitches in to help.

636
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,764
It's an extended, all day affair

637
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:38,035
of prepping, chopping,
dicing, slicing, mixing.

638
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,171
Of course there is some
sampling along the way.

639
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,340
Like this wild pig sausage that

640
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:46,110
someone was nice enough
to stop by with.

641
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:49,747
Sheldon works up a
potato-Mac salad.

642
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:50,515
One more type.

643
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:53,251
Hit me one more time.

644
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:59,790
Julio carves up unicorn fish
he caught earlier in the day.

645
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,959
A couple of fresh red snappers

646
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,362
are stuffed before being
thrown in the oven.

647
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:08,633
There is Po I pounded
fresh out back.

648
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,201
Somewhere, somewhere pig's foot

649
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:15,540
soup is happily bubbling away.

650
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:18,709
Why do I want to do this?

651
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,145
There is chili pepper water used

652
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,748
for dipping or taken as a shot

653
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:29,654
for boner medicine or whatever.

654
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:30,821
Oh, yeah.

655
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,890
There is also spam noodles.

656
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:38,296
There is no party without spam.

657
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:41,499
By dinner time the beerks wine

658
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,302
and festive beverages have
been flowing for hours.

659
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:47,905
Moods have been adjusted in
a completely natural way

660
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:50,841
indigenous to the
islands, of course.

661
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,912
How about Julio and the pig?

662
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,780
Oh, man.

663
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:57,815
I have cooked a lot of things.

664
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:01,286
I ain't never seen one poured.

665
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:02,653
Into a pot neatly.

666
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,589
It's what I love.

667
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,357
This is what we
do on the island.

668
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,693
This is what it's about.

669
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,695
Always bring the
family, the kids.

670
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:15,366
You rarely ever see a party
where there aren't kids.

671
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:19,003
Ohana means the... family.

672
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:22,206
Extended family.

673
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:27,445
Like you are now ohana
to everybody here.

674
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:30,981
So we can borrow money from you.

675
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:37,555
As happens, I have come to
find out things end up in the

676
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:40,124
most natural kind of happens
why, songs and dancing.

677
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:40,625
♪

678
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:53,471
This is Willie K. And that's
his daughter Lisette.

679
00:37:53,472 --> 00:38:00,044
It's pretty damn captivating.

680
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:00,545
♪

681
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:17,528
It's getting near
the ender for me.

682
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:20,230
I look over at sheep and see a

683
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,433
happy man surrounded by friends,

684
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:25,971
his family really... his ohana.

685
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:40,017
To be Hawaiian to me, there
needs to be a sense of

686
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:41,586
connection to a place.

687
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:45,556
Some sense of
responsibility for it.

688
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:49,226
It's about being honest to a
place, honest to what you love

689
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:51,396
and honest to what you value is

690
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:54,965
a road that's constantly trying
to be more and more informer

691
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:55,266
presidented.

692
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:59,604
I don't know sometimes
how to be fully honest.

693
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:00,204
I don't know enough.

694
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:03,408
What I love about the
oceans, that's my path way.

695
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:11,409
I go on the oceans to
seek that sense of truth.

696
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:28,265
They said I can see
whales, like close up.

697
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:30,968
I had reasons for optimism.

698
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,837
All week I had been staring out

699
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:35,573
to see watching lump back whales

700
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,642
spouting and frolicking
out of the ocean.

701
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:41,412
Are things compared to other
parts of the word, are

702
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,180
conservation of efforts as far

703
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,015
as marine mammal miss if general

704
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:46,584
but whales this
particular going well?

705
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:49,086
That's the one thing
on the planet that is.

706
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:53,157
They are talking about taking
humpbacks off the endangered

707
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:54,091
species list.

708
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,927
It's good to hear they have
recovered but it may make it

709
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,130
ease stairway the add to
the whaling list again.

710
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:04,802
It's mating season in Hawaii
for nearly 10,000 humpback

711
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:08,105
whales that migrate from
southeast Alaska each year.

712
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,441
Dr. Joe Mobli of the university

713
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:13,878
of Hawaii dedicated his career
to studying these whales.

714
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:19,784
I guess the song is supposed
to be the most complex display

715
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:22,487
in the an ma kingdom.

716
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:26,657
When you are close you can feel
it through your whole body.

717
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:31,962
180 db, really loud.

718
