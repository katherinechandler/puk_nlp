1
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:23,123
Everything changes.

2
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:28,795
Nothing changes at all.

3
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:36,603
♪ I took a walk through
this beautiful world ♪

00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,105

♪ sha, la, la, la, la,

10
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:19,212
Drinking at 4:30 in the

11
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,048
afternoon, it's the perfect time

12
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,883
when the light is just right.

13
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:24,684
It's important.

14
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,986
Also it's not too crowded.

15
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,456
It's quiet.

16
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:35,128
A man can have a drink, a pint,

17
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:43,129
in a dignified fashion
free of care.

18
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,309
Ice, son?

19
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,977
No, thank you.

20
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:51,811
Here you go.

21
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,380
Thank you so much.

22
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:55,815
So you're on holiday?

23
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,150
Sort of.

24
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,587
It's your first time in Glasgow?

25
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:04,056
No, I've been in a
number of times before.

26
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,160
I haven't been in
this pub before.

27
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,196
Oldest in... 1510.

28
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,149
1510, amazing.

29
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:31,083
From my very first
time, it was Glasgow.

30
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,020
My favorite city in Scotland.

31
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,888
One of my favorite
cities on earth.

32
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,524
It was going to say one of my

33
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:41,761
favorite cities in Europe,
but is Glasgow Europe?

34
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,696
I don't think so.

35
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:50,237
It feels somehow
older than that.

36
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:53,373
To many outsiders, Glasgow is

37
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,808
seen as a hard scrabble, even

38
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,076
fearsome place, a place that

39
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,945
history has moved on from, but

40
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,248
there is definitely a sense here

41
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:05,552
that something different
is around the corner.

42
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,287
It'll be one of the most

43
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:10,723
important events in Scottish
and British history.

44
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,725
More than 4 million people will

45
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:13,726
decide whether Scotland should

46
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,896
stay in the U.K. Or become
an independent country.

47
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:21,234
Will Scotland stay or
will it leave the union?

48
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,835
Scottish independence could

49
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:26,072
Mark the beginning of the end of

50
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,240
the U.K. As we know it.

51
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:34,080
But in the end, 55% of Scotts

52
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,982
voted to stay in the union.

53
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:39,151
That left almost half the
population still hungry for

54
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,153
independence and with 17.5% of

55
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:45,425
teenagers voting yes, England

56
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:48,761
had its undies in a bunch over

57
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:55,968
the possibility of an
unraveling Scotland.

58
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:03,969
Glasgow is a gutsy city.

59
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,948
Different outlook.

60
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,817
New generation, but I still here

61
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:14,287
the cries of yesterday.

62
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:17,857
Why does the possibility of
independence have such a

63
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:22,795
powerful hold on Glasgow?

64
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:23,063
The past.

65
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,064
Glasgow has along endured among

66
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,166
other things a reputation for

67
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,402
being the most violent
area in the U.K.

68
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:35,742
It's a familiar cycle, amal gos

69
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,410
in many ways to what
we see elsewhere.

70
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,579
Hard times, unemployment, a

71
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,815
general sense of apathy that the

72
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,884
government can't or won't fix

73
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,819
what's broken, that in the

74
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,858
corridors of power of London,

75
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:55,895
they just don't give a
shit about Glasgow.

76
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,164
Especially Glasgow's east side.

77
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:02,402
Like most cities,
Glasgow is divided.

78
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,936
The river divides the north and

79
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,339
south sides, but the bigger more

80
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,776
tangible divide is
between east and west.

81
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,712
The west, things are
expected to be, well, nice.

82
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:16,516
Nice cars, nice families, all

83
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:20,953
the nice stuff that affluence
supposedly brings.

84
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,855
East side, that's where you grow

85
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:26,459
up hard, where things are
rougher, where you've got,

86
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,061
according to popular legend, to

87
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:34,701
fight to live every day.

88
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,970
In Scotland, if you're a

89
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,039
young boy in Scotland and you're

90
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,375
9 or 10 and you're coming home

91
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,043
from school a big guy beats you

92
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,714
up and you run home crying,
you know what she'll do?

93
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,882
She'll give you a cuddle and

94
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:53,920
then she'll tell you get
back there and get him.

95
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,889
Don't let anybody
ever do that to you.

96
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,591
That's what we do.

97
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:03,396
And it makes us dangerous

98
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,897
enemies, resourceful enemies,

99
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:09,836
but it also makes us
very loyal allies.

100
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:13,840
Detective John Karnish 38

101
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,308
years on the job, much of it is

102
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,744
murder police on the east side.

103
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:20,947
He's seen it all.

104
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:25,652
Confronted with violent
hooliganism, the traditional

105
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:28,821
approach has been to get out

106
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:32,925
there, bust some heads,
lock up some perpetrators.

107
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,762
But after decades of dealing

108
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:39,799
with generation after generation
of violence, he took a

109
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,332
controversial new tactic.

110
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,537
Along with a colleague, he

111
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,506
established a new unit called

112
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,774
the violence reduction effort

113
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:51,778
and focused their efforts on the

114
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:58,217
social problems he felt led
directly to violent crime.

115
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:03,289
As of 2014, Scotland is at a 40

116
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,124
year low of violent crime.

117
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:10,463
When in town, though,
he likes to come here.

118
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:15,334
Typical Scottish
fare, mother India.

119
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,471
For a curry served in spicy

120
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:23,309
gravy served with traditional
non-Scottish bread.

121
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,246
I know Glasgow is a
traditionally tough town.

122
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:31,518
I've always seen it as a
warm and welcoming place.

123
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,353
Do you think the town's
reputation is deserved or is

124
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,889
this a... nope.

125
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,325
I mean in terms of labeling the

126
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,695
violence, the fights
are the fights.

127
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:46,232
But statistically, if you don't

128
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,434
live or come from Glasgow, your

129
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,838
chances of being a victim of a

130
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:58,244
violent attack in Glasgow
is something like .000.

131
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:02,615
I've done a fair amount of
stupid behavior here, a fair

132
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,351
amount of drinking, a fair

133
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,252
amount of putting myself in the

134
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:09,556
sort of situations they advise

135
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:13,893
visitors to a new
town not to take.

136
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,795
I've never felt
uncomfortable here.

137
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,565
I could be wrong in that after a

138
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:22,201
few drinks I notice that I
don't understand anyone.

139
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,070
They could be making various

140
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:26,038
threats of violence to me at the

141
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:33,245
bar, and I could just
be smiling and nodding.

142
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,148
Indian food is, of course,

143
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,919
huge here as it is
everywhere in the U.K.

144
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,488
You could venture to guess that

145
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:46,759
the cold, damp weather causes

146
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,732
the heart to yearn for
food from spicy climates.

147
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:56,102
That whole takeover India thing.

148
00:08:56,103 --> 00:09:02,108
All I can say is pass this.

149
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:06,679
So how do you reduce violence?

150
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,348
I mean traditionally we
would just get more police.

151
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,417
Crack some skulls
and problem solved.

152
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,319
A good number of Americans

153
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,254
probably still believe
that very much.

154
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,957
We're very fond of
throwing people in prison.

155
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:18,991
To suggest otherwise would be

156
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,928
seen as coddling criminals.

157
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,831
Absolutely, and it
was the same here.

158
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:30,436
We started to think about
it entirely different ways.

159
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,171
Violence is a public
health issue.

160
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:39,211
We all have the
capacity for violence.

161
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,280
People at home learn
not to be violent.

162
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,316
Things that happen then will

163
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:44,984
effect their whole life course

164
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,385
about how they make decisions

165
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,487
about themselves and
how they judge risk.

166
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,456
No matter how good the police

167
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,825
service is, it will just contain

168
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:53,993
and manage the problem.

169
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,628
It won't make it better.

170
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,529
First of all, it's not what I

171
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,799
expect to hear from somebody who

172
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,535
spent 30 years with murder
police, busting heads with

173
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:11,243
people, that we should hug
these bastards more...

174
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:16,482
Yes, absolutely.

175
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,686
Everything you've said...
This is going to take a

176
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:19,987
generation.

177
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:24,056
They go, oh, politicians
don't have a generation.

178
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,559
They're worried about the
newscast on Monday at 6:00.

179
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,829
The headlines, absolutely.

180
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,934
We don't have it sorted here,
but we're on a journey.

181
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,769
So what's going right here?

182
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:44,110
This is one of the most
awesome cities anywhere.

183
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,079
People.

184
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,024
I say shit we can't
keep doing this.

185
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:01,695
Let's try something different.

186
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,653
Look, I don't want to give

187
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:35,654
you the impression that
Glasgow is an impoverished

188
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:43,836
wasteland filled
with violence and

189
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,071
hooligans.

190
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,839
Let's face it.

191
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,908
Detroit or New Orleans, most

192
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:56,909
American cities make this
town look like club med by

193
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,785
comparison.

194
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:05,191
Glasgow remains the
region's noble shit zone.

195
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:08,160
What I find most endearing in

196
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,162
this town is if you're a native,

197
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:16,702
you're probably an
expert at taking a piss.

198
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:21,607
Well, it's good to be
back at work again.

199
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:25,978
No one excels more at
deflating the pompous, making

200
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,115
fun of self-importance, turning

201
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:37,116
even the darkest tragedy
into comedy than them.

202
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:43,329
That is, if you can
understand the bastards.

203
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,131
This can be a challenge after a

204
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:48,901
couple of pints of heavy.

205
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:53,806
Glasgow has a reputation of
being a hard drinking, two

206
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:54,307
fisted town.

207
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:55,141
Yeah.

208
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:59,846
I've always found it to
be this very funny town.

209
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:03,315
Very dark humor.

210
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:08,354
If you say in America,
my father died.

211
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,822
People are immediately
sympathetic.

212
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:17,823
If you say it here, they say
what size was his shoes.

213
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,268
We have that.

214
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:29,675
Jamie Godley grew up on the
east end, married into an

215
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,077
organized crime dynasty, worked

216
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,414
as a bartender, became a very

217
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:43,355
famous playwright, author,
and stand-up comedian.

218
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,557
I thought I'd meet her here at a

219
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,893
very old-school institution.

220
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:49,695
She's working some goat
cheese thing with figs.

221
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:56,869
For me, Scottish oysters are
an irresistible impulse.

222
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,440
They are magnificent,
by the way.

223
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:05,978
What a lot of people abroad

224
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:11,383
don't understand is wine is the

225
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,052
backbone of the industry.

226
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,388
That still exists, Tony.

227
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:22,061
The age expectancy is still 55.

228
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,464
In Iraq, it is still 65.

229
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,466
Wow, that's still an
extraordinary thing.

230
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,401
Yeah, I know.

231
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,770
I think the fact that we are a

232
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,340
bit shit helps us because we

233
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,008
have the commonwealth games here

234
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,743
and I loved that everybody tried

235
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:42,481
not to shout in the street and

236
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:47,353
swear and sell stolen
goods in public.

237
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,422
I loved the operation of
let's be nice for a week.

238
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,290
I loved that.

239
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:57,363
Main course, Jamie goes
for the pan-fried grill.

240
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:05,364
I can't pass up the fabulously
loved dish, lobster

241
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,011
thermostat.

242
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,213
It is Scottish, as is the

243
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:17,449
cheese, eggs, everything really.

244
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,320
Do you have anything
to say on the diet?

245
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:25,624
The diet, it's
really interesting.

246
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:33,625
The healthwise as far as
heart problems right behind

247
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:36,303
Tonga.

248
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:43,209
When I was a kid, we ate fish,
butter beans, potatoes.

249
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,676
Then we would have liver and

250
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:48,747
onions and potatoes
and cabbage and peas.

251
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:53,519
Somewhere from the mid 70s

252
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,854
onwards, it just became crap.

253
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,324
Now you have a generation of

254
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,859
women who don't know how
to make a pot of soup.

255
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,929
To be a real housewife, you have

256
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,198
to be able to make
a pot of soup.

257
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,067
I can't make soup.

258
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,836
The joke is I'm
apparently good at sex.

259
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,172
Sex takes five minutes.

260
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,107
Soup takes five days.

261
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:23,108
My husband has never
asked for soup.

262
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:30,556
There's a terrific music
scene in Glasgow.

263
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,192
The pubs are among
the finest anywhere.

264
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,894
They say they have more fun at a

265
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:41,633
funeral than people in Eden
borough have at a wedding.

266
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:47,573
That does invite, from time to

267
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,608
time, a fair amount of
knuckle-headed behaviors.

268
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:53,745
If you're looking for a beer and

269
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,148
a beating, Glasgow will have it.

270
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,551
The toughness thing is no joke.

271
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:04,423
If you ever try to choke a small

272
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,458
one into unconsciousness, as I

273
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,096
have, long story, it is like

274
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:13,632
wrestling with an
angry fire plug.

275
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,566
Also it hurts.

276
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:22,567
Access to guns is
extremely difficult here.

277
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,515
The old country way.

278
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:30,649
One person at a time.

279
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,618
A stabbing might not get more

280
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:36,655
than a few lines down in a

281
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,958
column in the Glasgow papers,

282
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,428
because in this city, ordinary

283
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,364
stabbing is hardly news anymore.

284
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:49,000
Where violence is an affliction,
there must be a cure.

285
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,602
He began his career working as a

286
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:55,441
bouncer in some of the east
side's toughest drinking

287
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,110
establishments where he had

288
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,180
plenty of opportunities
to hone his skill.

289
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:05,717
Now he runs tactical edge.

290
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,886
Come at him with a knife, the

291
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,521
overwhelming likelihood is that

292
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,458
it will soon be hanging
out of your ass.

293
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,059
Generally these courses start

294
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,495
come at me with a knife and a

295
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:21,567
guy comes at you like
it is Friday 13th.

296
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,803
Nobody outside "Friday 13th" has

297
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,972
ever come at anybody like this.

298
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:31,643
If somebody does come, they're

299
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:35,481
rushing at you with multiple...

300
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:43,482
In a manic, frenzy of
slashing movements.

301
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,156
Yeah.

302
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,825
You tend to get these
repeated lines of attack.

303
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:52,198
If they're going for the

304
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,833
stomach, it is a sewing
machine kind of action.

305
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,403
Is your first order of
business deflecting or getting

306
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,404
the knife from them?

307
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,272
I'm going to either gain

308
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:05,010
control of the weapon or go to a

309
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:05,544
returning blade technique.

310
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,212
Right.

311
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:10,182
Show me.

312
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:10,683
Okay.

313
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:20,692
The thing about knife defense is

314
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:24,430
there's no magic bullet.

315
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,198
Any technique can fail.

316
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:30,702
Any technique can go wrong.

317
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,771
If there's multiple opponents,

318
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:37,543
that can get difficult as well.

319
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,878
Here, this sort of thing, yeah?

320
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:43,215
If we've got the knife held up

321
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,951
close, okay, yeah, pull hit.

322
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,053
Now I'm going to force this

323
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:53,892
thing back into your sternum
repeatedly like I'm a

324
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:54,227
woodpecker.

325
00:19:54,228 --> 00:20:02,228
Put your hands up, brute
force, forth, charge.

326
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:06,838
That's it.

327
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,339
Charge.

328
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:18,584
So ATM mugging, I'm going to pin

329
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,685
your hand to me so I own the

330
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,321
weapon and I'm going to slap
backwards into the groin.

331
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,256
I'm going to hit, come up, grab.

332
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:32,257
Now I'm going to introduce
point a with point B.

333
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,670
You're going to want to let go,

334
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:44,843
so bang, bang, bang, bang.

335
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,646
This is a little bit more
close and sort of vicious.

336
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:48,780
Everybody doesn't see it.

337
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,783
I've cleared the weapon.

338
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:59,784
Shift yourself, knee him in
the balls, straight under.

339
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,461
That was an education.

340
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:02,795
No problem.

341
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,764
I enjoyed that.

342
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:40,832
Last night in Glasgow I had

343
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,734
enough with the deeper issues.

344
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,336
Now I want to go no deeper than

345
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:52,337
the bottom of a bubbling
calduron of haggis.

346
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,881
A happy place from my past where

347
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,350
once I frolicked young and

348
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,620
carefree in the field
of fried arts.

349
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:06,958
The university cafe where I
learned at the foot of the

350
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:10,629
masters the Dao of hot
fat and crispy batter.

351
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,932
Yes, they do a deep-fried Mars

352
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,634
bar and deep-fried pizza.

353
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,536
Been there, done that.

354
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:22,874
They've been keeping the
tradition alive since 1918 and

355
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:30,875
it ain't about no Mars bar.

356
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:34,586
> I'm tempted to go completely

357
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:38,890
nuts for all the things I like,

358
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:42,961
like pies, beans, and chips.

359
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,063
Cheese beano, I don't know what

360
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:49,401
that is, but I kind of want it.

361
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:50,736
Ooh, sausage roll.

362
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,972
I do like a good sausage.

363
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:57,909
I order the fish and
chips and some haggis.

364
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:03,949
Haddock battered and floating, a

365
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,585
drift in a sea of life-giving

366
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:14,586
oil as it Bobs like Noah's
ark bringing life in all its

367
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,128
infinite variety.

368
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,664
In tube form in this case.

369
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,599
If you don't like chopped up

370
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,705
liver and lungs and all
that stuff, believe me.

371
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:34,706
The curry sauce sets you right.

372
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:41,487
Guy Fieri in a kilt,
but what the hey.

373
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:45,857
I'm pretty sure god
is against this.

374
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:53,799
Oh, yeah, definitely.

375
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,365
That's good.

376
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,668
Doesn't eat well with a fork.

377
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:02,307
You really have to pick this up.

378
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:03,056
So ashamed.

379
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:23,328
Oh, yeah.

380
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:26,865
Clean living.

381
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:34,866
That's really one of
life's great pleasures.

382
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,174
Don't let them tell
you otherwise.

383
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:39,611
They're lying about you, Mr.

384
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:40,679
Haggis.

385
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,183
There was no other reviled
food on earth than haggis.

386
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:49,588
It's ingredients are no
more unusual or bizarre or

387
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:53,191
unappetizing than any
hot dog you ever ate.

388
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,760
How many anal glands are
in a chicken nugget?

389
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:57,362
I don't know and I'm not

390
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,030
suggesting there are anal glands

391
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:04,069
in a chicken nugget, but would

392
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,303
you be surprised if there were?

393
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,273
Back to you, wolf.

394
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:32,263
Heading north out of
Glasgow, Scotland quickly

395
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,566
becomes something else.

396
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:38,069
A savagely beautiful harsh, but

397
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,740
absolutely mesmerizing landscape

398
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:42,974
that seems to have changed not

399
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,743
at all for thousands,
even millions of years.

400
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:49,648
And across loch Marie and only

401
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:51,983
accessible by boat, one of the

402
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:58,256
great isolated
estates, letter U.

403
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:01,860
It's the favorite retreat
of my friend, Adrian Gill.

404
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:05,496
More widely known as a Gill.

405
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,934
He's the much feared and widely

406
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,302
followed restaurant critic for

407
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:15,140
the "London Sunday times,"

408
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,843
author, traveler, and one of the

409
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:20,712
finest essayists of our time.

410
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,614
Letter U. As it stands today was

411
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,015
built as a shooting lodge.

412
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,451
Deer stalking like they do here

413
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,153
is something from another era,

414
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:34,125
but it persists in places like

415
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,628
this which both protect and
cull deer populations.

416
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:40,298
If you are, like us, of course,

417
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,969
two murderous aristocrats
looking to put venison on the

418
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,072
table, you need help,
professional help.

419
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,240
Stephen Miller has been working

420
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,142
here for eight seasons now, both

421
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,078
protecting the animals who live

422
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,480
on it and helping people like us

423
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,649
in the arduous and delicate task

424
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,020
of sneaking up on them.

425
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:05,657
We would as gentlemen of leisure

426
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:08,994
require a cook and Adrian has

427
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:13,164
recommended a well-suited woman

428
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:16,334
who excels at this
Scottish game cookery.

429
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,738
For dinner, it's grouse.

430
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:25,610
Shot, then hung until the
already funky game bird gets

431
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:26,012
pleasingly ripe.

432
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:27,578
The birds are rubbed inside and

433
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:35,086
out with salt and pepper, some

434
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,922
fresh thyme jammed
in the cavity.

435
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:38,356
Bread sauce is a must.

436
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:43,461
We don't do this in America,
but here it's essential.

437
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,364
Basically it's milk simmered

438
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,399
with flavoring agent like nutmeg

439
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,473
and bay leaf and then thickened
with raspings of bread.

440
00:27:55,474 --> 00:28:01,880
Grouse barded with bacon,
then roasted in the oven.

441
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:04,382
They are moved to rest.

442
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,652
Game stock is added and the

443
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:08,887
sauce reduced, topped with water

444
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:16,888
cross along side with
parsnips and beet root.

445
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:19,364
So explain what we're eating,

446
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,265
because this is as
classic as it gets?

447
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:21,499
This is specifically Scottish.

448
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,769
This is a grouse, which is the

449
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,472
only truly wild game
bird in Britain.

450
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:33,078
They're the most highly
prized as a sporting bird.

451
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,145
They're the most difficult to

452
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,646
shoot, but more importantly

453
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,448
they're the most prized to eat.

454
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,418
This bread sauce
thing, what is that?

455
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:43,588
Bread sauce, you have to
grow up here to love this.

456
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:47,092
It is like pottage.

457
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:47,426
It's soft.

458
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:53,431
It's a very old dish, but it
goes very well... grouse,

459
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:56,601
they're a very gamey meat.

460
00:28:56,602 --> 00:29:00,972
It's a very grown-up taste that

461
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:05,443
is slightly repellant, but

462
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,313
within that, it is
particularly Al alluring.

463
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:08,714
Right.

464
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:12,283
There is something also
sexual about it that people

465
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,284
don't often talk about.

466
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:16,154
Right, right.

467
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,222
So good.

468
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,791
I'm going to a
vegetarian school.

469
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:26,965
My parents sent me to a
vegetarian boarding school, and

470
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:29,901
for nine years, the year after I

471
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,069
left, I was a vegetarian.

472
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,974
Nine years as a vegetarian,
that's unthinkable to me.

473
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,708
Then I decided not to be.

474
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,410
I made the decision if I was

475
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,346
going to eat meat again, then I

476
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,381
had to be prepared to
do the whole business.

477
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,316
Right.

478
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,985
You've got to be accountable.

479
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,320
For all of it.

480
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,056
For all of it.

481
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:54,325
So I started with the fish and

482
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,327
getting the guts and gutting it.

483
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,595
You want to eat it?

484
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:58,663
Come and kill it.

485
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:02,567
You go, well, then I
have to do that as well.

486
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:09,007
When I started doing it,
it was like coming home.

487
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:17,008
And that's the thing
with being on the hill.

488
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,025
Until the 19th century, the

489
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:29,027
Scottish highlands were seen by

490
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:32,197
many as a mysterious, hostile,

491
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:34,065
and dangerous land, populated

492
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:37,702
when populated at all by scary

493
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:44,409
ass barbarians, tribes so
ferocious, so extravagant in

494
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,411
their violence and toughness

495
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:49,948
that even in the Roman legions

496
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,951
decided not to mess with them,

497
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,285
hoping to keep them out of the

498
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,387
way of civilized society.

499
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,223
Later hunting estates like this

500
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:05,230
were home to farmers who
scrounged a living by growing

501
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:05,497
potatoes.

502
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:13,104
The highland clans
later by newer money.

503
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,006
Today around half the land in

504
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:23,007
Scotland is owned by
fewer than 500 people.

505
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:30,922
It's seductive as well.

506
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,091
Who wouldn't do this,
if they could?

507
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:38,429
Enjoy this kind of rugged

508
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,299
solitude from a warm,
inviting 17th century lodge.

509
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:47,105
Play a little snooker, enjoy
a single malt or two, the

510
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:53,678
substantial game meal, maybe
another whiskey perhaps,

511
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,647
contemplate the mysteries of the

512
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,882
universe under the sky and then

513
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:04,322
to sleep in the arms of

514
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:06,624
Morpheus, then to rise in the

515
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:10,195
morning as bringer of death.

516
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:12,897
Stephen and Adrian keep calling

517
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:16,367
it the hill, but that ain't
no hill I've ever seen.

518
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,637
It's a behemoth, an endless

519
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:22,640
range of behemoths, one mountain

520
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:30,641
way giving away to a moor, then

521
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:37,688
another, then
another, then more.

522
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,824
It's a daunting hike.

523
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,326
The climb gradual, then steep.

524
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:46,731
The footing ranging from
rocky to spongy and wet.

525
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:47,398
Mile after mile.

526
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,535
Me trying to look cool, make it

527
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,003
seem like this is nothing

528
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:56,975
unusual, but really I'm dying.

529
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:16,361
We walked the
highlands for hours.

530
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:20,365
Our stalker Stephen finally
identifies a red stag of

531
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:23,268
suitable age and size, one ready

532
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,103
in parlance to be
taken off the hill.

533
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:27,938
Getting in a range without

534
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,974
scaring them off, however,
is another challenge.

535
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:32,410
We need to circle around the

536
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:33,744
mountain to close the distance.

537
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:41,745
There's not a lot I can do.

538
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:51,722
So we go slowly.

539
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:59,337
Just pretend we're
hikers at the moment.

540
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:00,071
