1
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:14,447
My grandparents teach that
there are some people who have

2
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,417
been in Madagascar before.

3
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:27,760
They were very little people and

4
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:33,234
they live in forests and they
respect their environment.

5
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:45,245
But then comes many people from

6
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,580
other countries, from Africa,

7
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,251
from Asia, from
Spain, from France.

8
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,593
Many of us don't
know the history.

Over the years I've let a lot
of extraordinary landscapes

20
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,477
recede into a blur
outside my windows.

21
00:02:57,478 --> 00:03:05,478
I've looked, maybe seen,
maybe noticed, then gone.

22
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,256
We all carry different
experiences inside us.

23
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:15,828
We see things
differently, don't we?

24
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:21,268
Madagascar, exotic unspoiled

25
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:29,269
paradise or microcosm
for the end of times.

26
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:42,655
Antananarivo, Tana for short,

27
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:48,995
Madagascar's crowded
chaotic capital city.

28
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,597
How are you doing, man?

29
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:51,498
Base camp.

30
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:59,499
That's quite a rain.

31
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:02,842
I don't know.

32
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,446
I'm not sure if I can be
in front of the camera.

33
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,447
Just ignore them.

34
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,316
I'm so used to
controlling everything.

35
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:17,317
Director of the film's pie,
the wrestler, black swan, and

36
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,160
sort of appropriate to
our location "Noah."

37
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:28,501
He asked me if he could go
along on a trip with us.

38
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,370
I said where do you want to go.

39
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,839
Madagascar, I knew
almost nothing about it.

40
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,074
I knew it was an animated film

41
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,310
I've seen a lot of
times in my car.

42
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,312
It is one of the more extreme

43
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,981
places that you hear about but

44
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,917
you know you'll never go to

45
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,654
unless something
weirdly summons you.

46
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:53,059
We're on an island in the
Indian ocean with this amazing

47
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,096
ethnic mix, an
incredible landscape.

48
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:05,097
What does it mean when an
ecosystem goes out of balance?

49
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,376
What is the blowback?

50
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:10,176
Here, you can see the blowback.

51
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,110
All of a sudden you don't have

52
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:16,182
soil anymore and you can't
grow anything anymore.

53
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,184
There we go.

54
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,620
There we go.

55
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,854
An important question.

56
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,023
You are a vegetarian.

57
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:24,891
Yes.

58
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:30,530
And it just sort of happened
with the release of "Noah."

59
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:38,531
In scripture he was a
vegetarian as was Adam and Eve.

60
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,339
Humans weren't given permission

61
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,042
to eat animals until
after the flood.

62
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,579
So we'll see who is doing
better after the end of days.

63
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,549
Little social experiment here.

64
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,217
Madagascar was settled best

65
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:59,218
we can tell around 700 A.D.
by people from what is know

66
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,397
Indonesia, later Africans.

67
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,766
In 1895 the French took it,

68
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:07,667
killed off a substantial number

69
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,736
of people in the process, and as

70
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:16,909
they do, left behind beautiful
buildings and the French

71
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,244
language.

72
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:21,614
When independence came in 1960,

73
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:27,620
it was sudden and
ill prepared for.

74
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:31,591
Continuing political
incompetence has left most of

75
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,460
Madagascar's 22 million people

76
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:39,699
living on less than $2 a day.

77
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,103
Do you know this place?

78
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,272
Yes.

79
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,174

80
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,843
out, before going tonight club.

81
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,846
First meal in country and
I suggested this place.

82
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:57,049
I thought it would be perfect

83
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,553
with Aaron being a
vegetarian and all.

84
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,891
This is what you call being
passive aggressive, I think.

85
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:08,160
So what's good here?

86
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,028
Pork.

87
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,632
Pork, my favorite vegetable.

88
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,534
Just the head of the pork.

89
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:21,808
It sounds good.

90
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:25,377
I'm not going to have it.

91
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,647
I'm going to go just
with vegetables.

92
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,215
You don't want to taste it?

93
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:37,216
I'm not going to taste
pig head, not today.

94
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,860
Always take it with beans.

95
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,731
Rossi the famous musician

96

of favor with the previous

101

Not enough education.

102
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,024
We are very rich.

103
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,027
We have oil, but our political

104
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:19,465
leaders most of the
time are crook.

105
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,701
How much does the environmental
issues matter to

106
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,203
the people or is it
just about survival?

107
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,473
They don't care.

life and death.

and burn agriculture that's

was first settled and the

188

Madagascar are gone.

This is the kind of bamboo
chute that the lemurs loved.

It's full of protein and
it's full of cyanide.

211

The cyanide not a
problem for them.

212
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,212
They can tolerate all
kinds of cyanide.

213
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,081

through in the poop.

fiberglass actually.

235
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:59,778

told would be here, it
is what suboptimal.
