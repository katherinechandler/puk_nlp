1
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:37,105
So we begin at the end.

2
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:45,745
After a wild week in Seoul,

3
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:52,085
there was, I believe,
something called... involved.

4
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:56,123
There were many strange and
delightful things to eat.

5
00:00:56,124 --> 00:01:04,124
Things might have spun
slightly out of control.

6
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,439
♪ I took a walk through
this beautiful world ♪

7
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,779
♪ felt the cool rain
on my shoulder ♪

8
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,950
♪ found something good in
this beautiful world ♪

9
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:31,951
♪ I felt the rain
getting colder ♪

10
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,397
♪ sha la la la sha la la la sha

11
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:41,033
♪ la la la la sha la la la la

12
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:47,640
♪ la ♪

13
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:53,580
the biggest difference between
Korean fried chicken and

14
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:59,552
American fried chicken... I
feel like chicken tonight.

15
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:05,692
Next, we'll be performing a
medially from flavor town.

16
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:08,595
Who is everybody here?

17
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,597
Come to me, come to me.

18
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:17,170
Powerful in a small girly way.

19
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,172
Whoops.

20
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:21,441
Oh, yeah.

21
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,376
You shouldn't be surprised I'm

22
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,513
in a happy place right now.

23
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:29,216
Maybe the best way to tell

24
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:32,619
this story is to
start at the end.

25
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,087
Like a dog returning to its own

26
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,058
vomit, I keep flashing
back to was it last night.

27
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,594
The night before, I smell fried

28
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:45,265
chicken on my clothes
so perhaps... hello.

29
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,399
We meet again.

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,037
Am I glowing with health and
pink, freshly scrubbed?

31
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,139
You look like a better
version of yourself.

32
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,941
Why is that?

33
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:59,279
Because I've lost about
eight pounds of dead skin.

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Koreans like the idea
of optimal cleanness.

35
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,724
We like to be the
most clean possible.

36
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,895
I'm okay frankly
with soap and water.

37
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:16,230
I like beer.

38
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:20,099
Let me see if I can pour
this properly for you.

39
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,734
There you go.

40
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,570
Do you know about this?

41
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,237
No.

42
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:27,073
The Koreans have many
eating traditions.

43
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:31,411
If you have a very big
production or big event, you

44
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,145
celebrate that in a proper way.

45
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,448
What are we celebrating?

46
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:40,920
We're celebrating the
end of this Korea show.

47
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,789
This is important.

48
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,792
This is the most important
thing you've ever done.

49
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,795
There's nothing
involved with salt.

50
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:53,099
I don't have to rub that
into my raw, thick skin.

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:00,473
I'm a broken man.

52
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,342
I seem beneath the shame and

53
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,977
a headache to be missing a few

54
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:12,118
layers of skin, as if I've
been rubbed somehow raw.

55
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,252
I believe in clean, really,
but this is beyond clean.

56
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,557
This is sanded,
stripped, filleted.

57
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:21,394
The beer is not helping.

58
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,129
Well, maybe it is.

59
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,332
I think I've had enough.

60
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:30,470
The gleeful embrace of mixing

61
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:36,309
whiskey, rice wine,
beer, and oys

62
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,813
oysters, it seems
to tempt the fates.

63
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:40,981
Ooh.

64
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:43,249
Ooh.

65
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:43,984
Yes.

66
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:45,818
Let me ask you one
more question.

67
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,853
Uh-huh.

68
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:50,923
What do you think about
Han now after your trip?

69
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,326
I'm brimming with Han.

70
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,495
I mean I could never actually

71
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,764
have a Han because
I'm not that Korean.

72
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:02,335
This is a genetic
over cellular thing.

73
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,103
I understand.

74
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:08,341
But it's something I feel
I can really relate to.

75
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:15,014
I'm definitely a revenge is a

You eat a lot of chicken.

You didn't eat all day, did you?

79
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,125
No, I did not love
myself this morning.

80
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:31,030
But you felt better
after your scrub down?

81
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:39,031

Yeah.

No escape, just embrace.

I'm acutely aware of my role as

big brother, my new friends

All right, guys.

Let's party.

Nice to meet you.

So correct me if I'm wrong here.

It is dried squid, m&ms,
and mixing your alcohols?

Yeah.

107
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:16,522
It seemed like a good
idea back at the office.

108

Next we'll be performing a
medley from "mama Mia."

109
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,279
We got a low score.

110
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,949
We only got 44.

Squid treats and m&ms?

117
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:01,474
Sure.

118
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:04,243
Makes perfect sense.

119
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,313
In fact, there were oysters
somewhere along the route.

120
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:10,082
A tale that becomes increasingly

121
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:16,756
worrying with our
alcohol intake.

122
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,691
Oysters, awesome.

123
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:19,359
Nice.

124
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,694
Competitive drinking
and shellfish.

125
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:25,431
Have you ever played in
Korean drinking games?

126
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:25,933
No.

127
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,667
Well, they have a lot of them.

128
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,301
It keeps the energy up and keeps

129
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:33,539
everyone kind of drinking.

130
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,010
Stop two.

131
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:38,545
All right.

132
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:43,149
We're going to play a
little game first.

133
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,352
Tony, we're going to let
you start the festivities.

134
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,621
You have to use a chop stick,

135
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,791
hit everything forward,
it's going to splash up.

136
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:52,292
What?

137
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:56,562
A strike or a push?

138
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:04,563
A push.

139
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:09,342
There's a lot of games.

140
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:12,979
We're not going to go through

141
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,613
them all because it would take

142
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,047
forever and we'd be
really, really drunk.

143
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,150
But this game is called
the bottle cap game.

144
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,385
We're going to pass this around

145
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,320
in a circle and you're going to

146
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:29,321
flick it as hard as you can.

147
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,402
No one wins or loses.

148
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:43,509
We all get drunk.

149
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:43,777
Very good.

150
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:49,548
That is brotastic.

151
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,451
Okay, this is chop sticking.

152
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:57,256
Don't play this game
with engineers.

153
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:01,527
Oh, don't hurt the man.

154
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,731
He's been hitting
those oysters hard.

155
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:12,732
See you in flavor town.

156
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,875
One, two, and three.

157
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:20,579
It's pretty good.

158
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,385
That's good.

159
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,387
We got to go somewhere else.

160
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,289
Yeah, we're going.

161
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,292
Let's hit the street, guys.

162
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,996
The idea that only an hour

163
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:40,432
earlier we sat like
gentlemen and had barbecue.

164
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:48,433
A rapidly fading memory.

165
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,350
Tony, how many bottles
can you drink?

166
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,252
We'll see.

167
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:00,586
Yes, I remember now.

168
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,321
Somewhere near the start of the

169
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,924
evening, the moment little

170
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,592
brother grabbed the reins of our

171
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:11,297

reality of work tomorrow.

Eat the egg, eat the egg

175
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,338

176
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,273
That's good.

177
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,041
It's good.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

This is being Korea, beer is

00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:32,218
a must as is apparently soju.

182
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:37,356
What seems to define Korea as I

183
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:41,627
know it is it anticipates
the future very, very well.

184
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:42,895
This is a country that's famous

185
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:47,633
for looking forward,
looking into the future.

186
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:51,804
Where does one go to see Korea's

187
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:59,805
past, and are these guys
sentimental about it at all?

188
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,336
Younger brother?

189
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:32,337
All right, younger brother.

190
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,954
My mission for purposes of

191
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,190
television is to ingraciousuate

192
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,926
myself with a total group of

193
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,727
strangers, insinuate myself into

194
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:54,300
their lives and insert myself

195
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,468
into an expression combining the

196
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,970
concepts of company and meal.

197
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:01,707
In Korean culture, this
would be a regular thing.

198
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,711
A one night corporate
retreat, if you will.

199
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,713
Which is how I ended up at my

200
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,883
appointment with the fates, a

201
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:16,488
barbecue joint popular
with the salary man.

202
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:21,560
How did I end up here?

203
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,329
Mr. Noh.

204
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,897
Tony.

205
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,565
I think they like me.

206
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,434
Do you drink soju?

207
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:29,402
I do.

208
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,626
This is Anthony Bourdain, CNN.

209
00:14:54,627 --> 00:15:00,467
Good night.

210
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:07,974
Notice the totally blissed
out happy look an my face.

211
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:12,111
Observe the bowl with nothing
left but fiery remnants.

212
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:20,112
Behold the magnificence
that is this dish.

213
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,061
Enough, enough.

214
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,863
That's good.

215
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,301
Geez.

216
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:35,868
Oh, man.

217
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:43,869
That's going to go
straight to my hips.

218
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:45,545
Yes.

219
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:49,581
Okay, okay.

220
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,717
Thank you.

221
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:59,718
This is a magical dish.

222
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:11,270
So most people are not
sentimental about their time in

223
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:15,041
the military.

224
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:23,042
Why do this?

225
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,387
Everybody serves in
the military, right?

226
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:36,388
It's mandatory in Korea.

227
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,564
Very happy.

228
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,299
You want the recipe about this?

229
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,035
I got the recipe now.

230
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:46,605
It's everything mama warned

231
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,706
you about, and it's got it all,

232
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:51,110
baby, and when the music is
over, your life will have

233
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:51,578
changed forever.

234
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:59,579
One, two, three.

235
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,759
Okay.

236
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:15,434
Okay.

237
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,136
Yes.

238
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:16,836
Yeah.

239
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:19,438
Dating back to famine years of

240
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,941
the Korean war, scrounging from

241
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,844
American military bases, it is a

242
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:32,118
classic example of necessity
feeding the mother of

243
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:32,452
deliciousness.

244
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:36,755
Hot dogs, baked beans, spam, and

245
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,957
noodles put together
with kimchee.

246
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,761
It became an enduring and
deeply loved classic.

247
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:46,498
Like I used to say to my first

248
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:54,005
girlfriend, how could something
so wrong be so right.

249
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,975
You got that right.

250
00:17:56,976 --> 00:18:04,976
No, no, no.

251
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,893
Wow!

252
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:15,195
No.

253
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:23,196
I tell you.

254
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:28,807
I'm sorry about that.

255
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:33,145
Sorry, man.

256
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:39,985
Regrettable incident.

257
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:40,687
Looks healthy.

258
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,354
Look at this thing.

259
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:46,358
Look at the color alone.

260
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:54,359
In go the noodles.

261
00:18:59,206 --> 00:18:59,739
Wow.

262
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,839
Yeah, baby.

263
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,907
Yeah, baby.

264
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:05,244
Come to me, come to me, my love.

265
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:09,548
Yes.

266
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:13,552
Little spam in there.

267
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,187
Good job, chef.

268
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,722
Good chefs.

269
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,591
Yes, yes, yes.

270
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,227
Thank you.

271
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:22,861
My pleasure.

272
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,630
Any time.

273
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:29,968
In a society reeling from
conflict and deprivation,

274
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,037
largely without meat and fresh

275
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:40,038
ingredients, this was
the gift of the G.I.

276
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:45,150
The Korean war lasted from 1950

277
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:50,055
to 1953, but in many
ways it never ended.

278
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,624
The country is split in half and

279
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,461
in a constant state of alert.

280
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:59,064
120 miles to the north, a crazy

281
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,433
dictator with an army, a bad

282
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,302
haircut, and a nuclear arsenal.

283
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,136
This we know.

284
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:09,975
But the war divided a country
and divided families.

285
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:14,580
Altered forever the
Korean character.

286
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:15,581
The chef's early experience

287
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:18,484
working the mess hall during his

288
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:21,453
mandatory military service led

289
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,855
directly to super stardom.

290
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,091
He beams his cooking show live

291
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,294
in more than 50,000 homes today

292
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,962
via something called
the Internet.

293
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,164
And he's not the only one.

294
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,934
There's competition.

295
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,436
Lots of it.

296
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:41,773
Broadcast eating, it's kind of a

297
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:45,611
phenomena in Korea, which is how

298
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:53,612
I wound up in a tent on
the outskirts of Seoul.

299
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,322
Right here?

300
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,023
All right.

301
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:58,658
Classic indigenous ingredients.

302
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,225
No spam.

303
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,727
Excellent.

304
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,994
Yes.

305
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,964
All right.

306
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,884
It's a slaughterfest.

307
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,986
I've gotten killed like 12

308
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,054
times already today, so I think

309
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,689
I'm going to hang it up.

310
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,991
All right, I'm ready
for some food.

311
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:36,495
In Korea, the food delivery
system is really good.

312
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,029
Really good.

313
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,500
A whole bunch of food
you can just order.

314
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,702
Order food while you're playing?

315
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:44,571
Yeah.

316
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:48,507
PC bomb sounds like a male

317
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:52,411
porn store, but this
one has a lounge.

318
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:57,449
Here in Seoul, given that
there's an entire strata of

319
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,052
professional gamers, more

320
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,555
sustainable food is, from
time to time, required.

321
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,123
No problem.

322
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:08,927
Anything you want right
to your console.

323
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:13,031
Real-life, does it
have any attraction?

324
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,065
Real life?

325
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,534
You know nongaming world.

326
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:16,902
People love it.

327
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,937
Professional gamers, people love

328
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,406
the professional gamers.

329
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:25,210
They get a lot of fame for that.

330
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,244
Right.

331
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:29,915
Oh, man.

332
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:30,617
This is too much.

333
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:33,485
You got to get the
sauce with the noodle.

334
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,220
Yep.

335
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:36,054
It's a black noodle.

336
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:36,889
It should be all black.

337
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:37,824
Tasty.

338
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,591
Good?

339
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:39,392
That'll work.

340
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:44,162
Some of the games you can
play while still eating.

341
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:45,296
One handed?

342
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,399
Basically, you eat a little

343
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,001
bit and then play the game, eat

344
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,070
a little bit, then
play the game.

345
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:56,442
The only game I've ever really
gotten serious about and

346
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:57,776
lived with a year... I spent a

347
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:01,146
lot of time and it
was GTA vice city.

348
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:04,450
In my opinion, it is a
little bit violent for me.

349
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:08,687
That's my personal opinion.

350
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:12,591
Look, there was a lot of
bleeding out in this game.

351
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,493
That's true.

352
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,128
Over the mountain and through

353
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,764
the woods to grandmother's house

354
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:22,701
we go, blowing some shit up on

355
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:30,702
the way and was it right
click, left click?

356
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:32,178
Okay.

357
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:39,451
I'm looking for the little
guys with the red over them.

358
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,722
Yeah.

359
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,458
That doesn't look good.

360
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,560
Oh, geez.

361
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:48,961
I'm respawning.

362
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:51,396
Yeah, respawning.

363
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,164
You could target.

364
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,233
You can pull long distance or

365
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:59,370
short distance depending
on where your target is.

366
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:05,844
I'm just learning
how to move here.

367
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:11,583
Oh, poor little red riding hood.

368
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:17,656
She's not good.

369
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:25,657
If I'm shooting
something, it's me.

370
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:26,699
Oh, no.

371
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:32,504
Little red riding hood,
you're bleeding out again.

372
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:34,372
Oops.

373
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,741
Didn't make it.

374
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:39,110
I don't see any bad guys.

375
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:47,111
Are these friends?

376
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:51,222
Oops.

377
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,559
Back in the old days before

378
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,426
time itself, spending 17 hours a

379
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,764
day at places like this was
frowned upon by family.

380
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:02,400
Now gaming has become a
respected and often lucrative

381
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,903
profession in Korea.

382
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:08,574
Simon has pretty much retired
from gaming, per Se.

383
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:12,611
Instead he makes a living
advising rising stars in the

384
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:12,912
industry.

385
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:14,445
You do this for a living?

386
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:14,814
Yeah.

387
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,247
How many hours a day?

388
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,049
The professional gamers, they

389
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,819
spend all day playing this game.

390
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,188
They wake up, play
a game, practice.

391
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,256
Have lunch, practice again, have

392
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,258
dinner, and go to sleep.

393
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:32,063
Today the game is one of
those multiplayer kill fests

394
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:40,064
where mighty avatar post
a range of abilities.

395
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,473
There we go.

396
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,075
This is all about love.

397
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,110
Really cute.

398
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,678
Little girl.

399
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,315
That's me?

400
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:53,418
Oh, geez.

401
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,988
Can we choose another
avatar maybe?

402
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,424
Something more killy?

403
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,126
I don't know if I'm going to

404
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:06,832
strike fear into my enemies.

405
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,533
Little girl comes around the

406
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:11,169
corner having a big
fireball on your head.

407
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,806
I'll try to keep up with
you for a few minutes.

408
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:21,546
Press W to go forward and
press right and left clicked

409
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:21,814
together.

410
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:23,615
Right key on the mouse.

411
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,152
Forward is W.

412
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28,219
Yeah.

413
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,488
E shift and left together.

414
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:34,025
Shift and then...
Left together, yeah.

415
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:38,496
Then space, right click, left

416
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:39,998
shift with left click together.

417
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:40,900
Brutal.

418
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:42,634
How long did it take you to

419
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:46,037
figure out how to move
around in this world?

420
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,138
About ten minutes.

421
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,175
Ten minutes, yeah.

422
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:53,511
Okay, me and Simon are going

423
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:56,014
up against these kids and I'm

424
00:26:56,015 --> 00:27:01,319
expecting to pistol whip some

425
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,726
bitches unless time has
once again passed me by.

426
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:12,530
The life of a professional video

427
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,766
gamer is a concept that's
not easy for me to grasp.

428
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,868
These young nerd
lingers are famous.

429
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,236
They have TV shows where they

430
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,505
compete and are making
actual cash money.

431
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:23,108
They have sponsors
and super fans.

432
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:27,245
They probably even get
laid off this shit?

433
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,280
And that explains how little red

434
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,616
riding hood ended up bleeding

435
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:35,020
out on the cold,
hard, virtual floor.

436
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,255
Should we start the game?

437
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,556
Sure.

438
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,526
Okay, where's our opponents?

439
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,138
I'm going to fire your ass.

440
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:56,942
Don't say anything
about Wayne Newton.

441
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:59,544
He's the man.

442
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,412
He's early 90s west coast.

443
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,749
I'm a west coast guy.

444
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,452
I'm not entirely convinced
that Korean food is healthy.

445
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:11,757
Have you always been a food guy?

446
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:14,459
I'm very happy here.

447
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,227
Last one?

448
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:16,896
Yeah.

449
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,329
Is this drinks that goes with

450
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,932
food or is this food
that goes with drinks?

451
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:26,271
The culture is you have to

452
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,273
have something that goes
well with that drink.

453
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:32,010
We should probably be
drinking that, right?

454
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,946
Yes.

455
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:38,349
Have you had soju before?

456
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,287
How often can you come to
a place like this a week?

457
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:49,294
Would you come every day?

458
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,162
Sure.

459
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,765
I like to recommend
the soup of death.

460
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:58,469
It's a soup, but the main
ingredient in that is silk

461
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,805
worms.

462
00:28:58,805 --> 00:28:59,305
That okay?

463
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:03,708
Yeah, sure.

464
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:03,943
Oh.

465
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:04,510
Nice?

466
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,011
Oh, yeah.

467
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:10,982
Eating bugs, that
is so last network.

468
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,483
How do you like the soup?

469
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,684
The soup is awesome.

470
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:21,685
I'm going to go home and
have Benisans tonight.

471
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,000
Get the [ Muted ] out of my
soup and make me a sweater.

472
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,836
Even Koreans don't eat this

473
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:32,503
all the time, but I guess this

474
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,572
country makes you feel like if

475
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,876
you can't eat this,
then you're not Korean.

476
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:40,846
What were you born?

477
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:41,213
In New York.

478
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,081
In New York.

479
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:42,581
Yes.

480
00:29:42,582 --> 00:29:46,184
And were there until
until roughly 21.

481
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:53,391
I grew up on the streets
and new York city.

482
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:56,561
It was automatically
you're a chink.

483
00:29:56,562 --> 00:30:01,032
I'm Korean and I'm
proud to be Korean.

484
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:05,770
Mark is what's called a
Korean who has lived abroad.

485
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,539
More and more people are, like

486
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,410
Mark, moving back home for
the ever more numerous

487
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:12,744
opportunities.

488
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:16,181
When I came here, it
just felt right for me.

489
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,016
I'm here.

490
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:19,517
These are my peoples.

491
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:22,187
This has what I've been missing.

492
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:25,123
I was considered an
outsider in my own country.

493
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:27,758
I had like this thing going on

494
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,230
because I was like am I not
Korean enough if I don't do

495
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,132
this, if I don't drink this, if

496
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,400
I don't eat this, but there was

497
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,435
a sense of I want to learn this

498
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:42,473
if that makes me
feel more Korean.

499
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,109
Nice.

500
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,744
Is this so hard to walk in and

501
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,447
eat delicious food and get
hammered in the street?

502
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,250
Being Korean is pretty awesome.

503
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:56,254
Last one.

504
00:30:56,255 --> 00:31:02,928
Yeah.

505
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:08,299
Nighttime in Seoul and
everywhere you go it seems, food

506
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,434
and drink.

507
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:11,069
This is what they call kind of

508
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,806
like a pub, if pubs could
operate in the street.

509
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,309
You can have drinks, and well, I

510
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,512
guess you could
call it, pub food.

511
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:26,151
We're about to go eat
some really, really good.

512
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:28,519
Welcome to Seoul.

513
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:28,854
Let's do this.

514
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:33,691
My new friend Mark helped

515
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:38,296
popularize western style
hip hop in Korea.

516
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:41,933
An event that led me to
eating silk worms in a tent.

517
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,902
So where are we?

518
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,145
Do I have the position correct?

519
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,881
Are you complaining
about your hours?

520
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:01,552
Number one selling liquor
in the whole world.

521
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:04,655
Prostitutes so many times.

522
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,692
Get many my mouth
and stay there.

523
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:11,829
She's already dead.

524
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:19,830
Come on.

525
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:25,410
I'm getting this weird
sense of deja vu.

526
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:27,012
Haven't we been in a fish market

527
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:28,546
in Seoul at some point?

528
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:33,518
Maybe a slight... what should
we toast to this time?

529
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:41,519
To a triumphant return to Korea?

530
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:47,198
There's something I've been
craving since I got off the

531
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:47,533
plane.

532
00:32:47,534 --> 00:32:51,936
The snacks that accompany
your meal in Korea.

533
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:57,242
This is one of the most
exciting things about Korean

534
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:57,743
food.

535
00:32:57,744 --> 00:33:01,579
Doesn't that make you
want to drink more soju?

536
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,049
Is that a hint or something?

537
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:08,086
I know the formality of it all.

538
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:11,922
The appetizers, yes, I
remember these guys.

539
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:16,794
Bringing back memories.

540
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:20,531
Here we go.

541
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,733
So this is spicy stew.

542
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,602
I need it to burn.

543
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:29,774
It has everything under
the sun seafood wise.

544
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:32,877
You can find crab,
all kinds of fish.

545
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,113
Fishermen stews all
over the world.

546
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:35,881
Exactly.

547
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:38,483
This bowl for me, that's the

548
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:40,985
perfect example of
Koreans in general.

549
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,253
We love being together in a

550
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:48,726
space, huddled around a
bubbling pot of something.

551
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,428
This is good.

552
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:53,798
You are failing your duties
as a young assistant.

553
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:57,102
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

554
00:33:57,103 --> 00:34:01,506
We don't have to drink
it immediately, do we?

555
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:04,342
Face planting.

556
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:06,611
Koreans, they just want each

557
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:09,247
other to drink as
much as possible.

558
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:12,617
Peer pressure drinking
is kind of a big deal.

559
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,153
May I have another glass please?

560
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:19,657
Korean drinking etiquette 101.

561
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,792
You never pour your own drink.

562
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:26,131
Younger pours for the older
and you never drink alone.

563
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:31,969
How come all the Korean
guys are so tormented?

564
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,840
They're carrying around
an unseen weight.

565
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,476
Every single Korean person is

566
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,778
born with this thing called Han,

567
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,481
which is a deep
sorrow and anger.

568
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:47,986
It has nothing to do with your

569
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:51,823
upbringing.

570
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,057
Han, my favorite Korean word.

571
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:55,326
Generally speaking, it is a

572
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:58,196
mixture of endurance, yearning,

573
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:02,333
sorrow, regret, bitterness,

574
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:05,803
spite, hatred, and to bide your

575
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:10,175
time until revenge can
at last be exacted.

576
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:14,212
Revenge is a very, very sweet

577
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:18,749
tasting thing for Koreans
because there's been so much

578
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,351
wrong that's happened to us.

579
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:21,419
What about little Timmy

580
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:28,025
master who is made fun
of you in second grade?

581
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:32,197
Is there vengeance
coming their way?

582
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:38,569
I want them to actually
love Korean food now.

583
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,039
Doesn't sound anywhere close
to personal suffering.

584
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,010
Well, that's my personal story.

585
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:48,045
I would think electric
nipple clamps.

586
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:53,184
They slowly bled the
reason that Koreans are

587
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,919
able to just not wallow in that

588
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,058
is because of this other
emotion called Chung.

589
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,128
It is a deep fondness that you

590
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,264
have for your other Koreans, and

591
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:09,033
people all focus on Haun and I

592
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,769
know, like, Haun, yes,
yes, yes, it exists.

593
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,137
No one is denying that.

594
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,640
We all have it.

595
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,041
But Chung, no one talks about

596
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,244
that and it's equally strong.

597
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:19,745
Okay.

598
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:21,546
I believe you.

599
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:23,381
I don't think you believe
me about this Chung thing.

600
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:24,915
No, I believe you.

601
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:28,152
Like I like the
whole idea of Han.

602
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:29,987
I totally get that as an engine.

603
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:30,756
I like that.

604
00:36:30,757 --> 00:36:32,590
I like that dark side.

605
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:34,492
The fact that this word exists

606
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:37,595
is sort of awesome because a
negative emotion has been

607
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:41,599
converted into a number of
very, very, very positive

608
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:41,933
developments.

609
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:42,934
Absolutely.

610
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:45,570
Koreans are, you know, this

611
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,904
amazing group of people that

612
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,172
don't curse and eat amazing

613
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:50,275
food, and we like to
drink and have fun.

614
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:54,612
Oh, stop sucking up.

615
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:55,746
So, to the Han.

616
00:36:55,747 --> 00:37:00,685
We need to make a serious toast.

617
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,086
We're you a nuclear and amazing.

618
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:02,821
That describes me.

619
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:03,921
I'm not drinking this.

620
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:11,922
No, you don't have to drink it.

621
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:17,335
My relentlessly cheerful
friend and colleague Nari.

622
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,136
She loves Korea and all things

623
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,505
Korea and wants nothing more

624
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:23,808
than to make everybody love
it as much as she does.

625
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,810
That's why she brought me here

626
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:28,946
to the Garak fish market where

627
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,482
you find the kinds of
casual joints that I love.

628
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:35,320
I will have, let me
see, perhaps the fish.

629
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:38,523
I want some enchana and spicy

630
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:41,492
stuff and we'll start
off by drinking.

631
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:41,727
Yes.

632
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:44,061
I'm getting a weird
sense of deja vu.

633
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:47,965
Like haven't we been at
a fish market in Seoul.

634
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:48,834
Walk down memory Lane.

635
00:37:48,835 --> 00:37:50,802
At some previous life.

636
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:05,015
The past, the
present, the future.

637
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,184
In Korea they all
bleed together.

638
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,186
If you're there for the whole

639
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:11,188
ride, one explains the other.

640
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:19,189
Drop in in the middle, and
it makes no sense at all.

641
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:29,006
Korean culture, as far as I can

642
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:33,344
tell, is defined by the drive to

643
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:37,748
succeed, a churning engine
fueled by decades of Han, a

644
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:42,052
remarkable ability and
remarkable willingness to

645
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:42,721
anticipate the future.

646
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:48,393
It reaches back across time
and binding millennials and

647
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:54,632
generations long since passed.

648
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,734
Last time I was here I was

649
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:57,868
working for another channel, the

650
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,069
bacon channel, the competitive

651
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,073
eating channel, what was
that old show called?

652
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,042
It was so long ago.

653
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:06,377
Back then I was dragged around

654
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:11,248
in Nari's powerful
wake, as I recall.

655
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,618
That was nearly a decade ago.

656
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,319
Things have changed since then.

657
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,722
I've changed and I'm guessing

658
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:23,961
Nari's changed, and Korea,
Korea has certainly changed.

659
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,295
The Korean war ended more than

660
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,467
half a century ago, but in
some ways it's still going.

661
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,502
The north and south have been on

662
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,938
perpetual war
footing ever since.

663
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:37,141
It's a psychological
and physical scar.

664
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:40,077
Korea is literally split in

665
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:45,650
half, but that's not
what this show is about.

666
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:46,751
There aren't many comparisons to

667
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,587
South Korea's stratospheric
rise over the last decade.

668
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:51,088
One of the poorest countries as

669
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:55,292
recently as '60s, today it
claims one of the world's

670
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,294
fastest growing economies.

671
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:00,698
The government has been
extremely shrewd and forward

672
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:02,433
thinking about selling the world

673
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,335
all things Korean, underwriting,

674
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,939
encouraging, financing and
supporting the export of

675
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,942
intangibles, things like music,

676
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,211
movies, TV show, food, the whole

677
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,781
Korean sensibility, and the

678
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,649
world is responding, learning to

679
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,453
love what Koreans
have always loved.

680
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:26,491
The heart of Korea is Seoul,
capital city, a bustling

681
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:27,492
Metropolis.

682
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,827
Futuristic in look
and character.

683
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,896
Population 25 million.

684
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:32,831
Look at that.

685
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:36,233
They have a selfie stick.

686
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,669
Everybody is taking
pictures of their food.

687
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,904
They feel right at home.

688
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:44,842
In October 2014 I
went back to Korea.

689
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:46,844
This is what I saw.

690
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:50,180
This makes me so happy.

691
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:54,418
The kimchi, make room
for the noodles.

692
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,654
Oh, that's good.

693
00:40:56,655 --> 00:41:00,024
Should be no surprise that
I'm in a happy place now.

694
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,892
Oh, yeah.

695
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,494
First night back.

696
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:04,562
Back to the market.

697

Unrecognizable and
invariably and inevitably
