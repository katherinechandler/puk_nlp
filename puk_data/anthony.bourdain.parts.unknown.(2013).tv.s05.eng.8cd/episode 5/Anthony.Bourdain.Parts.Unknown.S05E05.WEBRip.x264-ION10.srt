1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,642
And vacation over as he... we
headed home to our regular

2
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:14,047
beds, our daily lives of school
and homework and ordinary

3
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:14,282
things.

4
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:18,651
Maybe my little brother, maybe I

5
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,387
would wake up and look out the

6
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:25,892
window at the night sky and
suddenly it would fill with

7
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:30,463
stars and golden mist, and we'd

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,732
pretend for a second we were

9
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,836
somehow deep inside the milky

10
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:44,611
way, a million winking lights,

11
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:49,182
but we knew where
we really were.

12
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,683
We were almost home.

00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:56,856
♪ I took a walk through
this beautiful world ♪

00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,426

21
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:41,968
O enchanted land of my
childhood, a cultural petry dish

22
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,705
from which regularly
issues forth greatness.

23
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:50,477
New Jersey, in case you didn't
know it, has got beaches,

24
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,212
beautiful beaches, and they're

25
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:57,350
not all crawling with raging
trolls with reality shows.

26
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,921
I grew up summering on those
beaches and they're awesome.

27
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:09,196
Jersey's got farmland,
beautiful bedroom communities.

28
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:14,667
Even the refineries, the endless

29
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:19,906
clover leaves of turnpikes and

30
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,708
expressways somehow beautiful.

31
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:29,709
To know Jersey is to love her.

32
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,689
Ft. Lee, you may
have heard of it.

33
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,459
Some of governor Christie's

34
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,129
minions allegedly conspired
to jam up traffic a few days.

35
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,198
It's a town with a joky history

36
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:51,204
of corruption, it's also
where my beloved Hiram's is.

37
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:54,707
Opened since 1932 and unchanged

38
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,643
since, my dad started bringing

39
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,545
me and my younger brother here

40
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,147
in the 50s and they
still honor tradition.

41
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:06,553
Sometimes I just the
need that old flavor.

42
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,121
It seems like a chew food.

43
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,991
Basically my dad
would take me here.

44
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,927
It is a great point of pride and

45
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,229
satisfaction and I've convinced

46
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,400
my daughter this is the
finest hot dogs in the land.

47
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,067
She gets very excited to come

48
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:25,171
out here, which makes me happy.

49
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:25,639
Thank you.

50
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,306
Thank you.

51
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:26,839
This is heat.

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,343
The toothpicks are
just like 1958.

53
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,246
Some things just
shouldn't change.

54
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:38,851
My dad used to love relishing
that I loved this stuff.

55
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:45,592
Look at that beauty.

56
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,959
Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,365
I come here to feed my soul, the

58
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,602
cultural wellspring
that's new Jersey.

59
00:03:55,603 --> 00:04:00,473
It's the antidote to
every other place.

60
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,608
The place is perfect.

61
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:07,947
The dogs are amazing.

62
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:11,017
There are not a lot of people in

63
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:19,018
this world courageous
enough to not change.

64
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:29,469
Down the shore, yeah, we
actually talk like that.

65
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,173
It was what we did,
go down the shore.

66
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,377
Not just our family from Bergen

67
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:41,213
county near the bridge, but
families and working-class

68
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,984
families from all over who
packed up the kids in the

69
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:52,158
station wagon for the
intermable trip to long island.

70
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,993
There was always drama.

71
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:57,430
Once we were over the bridge,

72
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,332
the excitement would ratchet up.

73
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:06,506
Ship bottom, then surf city,
love ladies, ticking off the

74
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:14,013
town names until finally,
finally, Barnegat light.

75
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,114
New.

76
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,416
These are all new.

77
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:16,949
That's original.

78
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,018
Yeah, definitely.

79
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,521
I think I know who lived
there at one point.

80
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,922
That's definitely old school.

81
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,223
Let's face it.

82
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,593
It's been how many years?

83
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:30,029
40... 400, I think.

84
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,564
Jesus, we're old.

85
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,700
The lighthouse.

86
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,736
Definitely remember going
to that lighthouse a lot.

87
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:40,206
Definitely the good old days.

88
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,541
I want some fried clam strips.

89
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,208
Absolutely.

90
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,812
Our options are limited,
shall we say, but holy crap.

91
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:50,417
This place is filling up.

92
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:53,420
I think it's because
it's the only place.

93
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:55,121
Who lives out here year round?

94
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,056
We're about to see every
single one of them.

95
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:00,326
Let's be honest.

96
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,762
When we came here in the sum
summers, I was the bad one.

97
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:03,730
Yes, yes.

98
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:08,300
Your recollection is correct.

99
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,770
I didn't smoke dope for
the first time here.

100
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,906
I was looking for dope, but as a

101
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,508
12-year-old it was
hard to come by.

102
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:22,081
I remember you vaguely walking
off with some sort of

103
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:22,349
cute girl.

104
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,850
First kiss.

105
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:24,451
This is good.

106
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:25,852
It is good.

107
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:29,021
I realize now I
hitchhiked regularly.

108
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:29,922
Yeah.

109
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,024
Mom, dad, I'm going to go to

110
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:38,330
ship bottom tonight
with some friends.

111
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,331
How are you getting there?

112
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:39,633
Hitchhiking.

113
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:39,833
Okay.

114
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,634
Have fun.

115
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,537
That's how you got places here.

116
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,673
Summertime.

117
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,941
You know that sound?

118
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:54,180
Just out of the water, eared
pressed up against the beach

119
00:06:54,181 --> 00:07:00,853
blanket, the squeak of bare
feet on sand nearby, classics

120
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,457
illustrated comics waited
for me back at the house.

121
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:10,129
I'd play with my little plastic
army men in the dunes and

122
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,131
there's a smell of beach
grass in the dunes.

123
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,467
You remember it?

124
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:15,468
I still crave it.

125
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,036
I love it.

126
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:21,841
And on special occasions
clams in drawn butter.

127
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:26,412
I remember this place with
nothing but fondness.

128
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,247
I can't remember a
single bad memory here.

129
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,350
People you knew from
last year we were here.

130
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,185
The parents didn't
need to be with you.

131
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,355
Have a campfire on
the beach at night.

132
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:43,329
All this stuff they wouldn't
let you do at home.

133
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,831
The beach would look different.

134
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:48,768
For a couple of days, the beach

135
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,270
would be this weird foamy surf.

136
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,238
Now we're talking.

137
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:56,509
Or there would be the jelly
fish delivery sometimes.

138
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:03,182
Infestation of
jelly fish, right.

139
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,919
I try to block that out.

140
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,522
Love the clam strips.

141
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:09,957
These are great.

142
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:10,790
These are awesome.

143
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,692
So far, so great.

144
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,293
I'm happy.

145
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:18,965
Battered piece of fish with
some good tartar sauce.

146
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:22,201
What were your
favorite activities?

147
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,304
Building a campfire
on the beach.

148
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:29,375
Firecrackers on the beach.

149
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:33,212
I have some firecrackers
in your car, by the way.

150
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:33,547
Just saying.

151
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:37,216
Set them off at the casino.

152
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:37,761
Perfect.

153
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:45,792
♪

154
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,465
It was paradise.

155
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,234
America's first dream vacation.

156
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,236
The beach as far as America was

157
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,337
concerned, meaning bathing suits

158
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:03,342
and swimming in the surf, was
pretty much invented here.

159
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,277
Atlantic city, rich or working

160
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,445
class, it was here for you.

161
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:10,282
Back then you dressed up
to walk the boardwalk.

162
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,954
It was capitalism at its
purist and most assertive.

163
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:20,793
It was a Democratic dream
designed from the beginning for

164
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:21,594
everybody.

165
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:28,768
Flashy, utilitarian, upright,
deeply, unapologetically,

166
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,002
corrupt.

167
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:32,538
In many ways its story a perfect

168
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:36,175
reflection of changing times.

169
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:43,349
Established in 1912, the second

170
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,889
floor had curtained alcoves
and a separate lady's lounge.

171
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,026
Vicky's dad was the chief
photographer for Atlantic city

172
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,863
from the 1930s to the 1960s.

173
00:09:56,864 --> 00:10:00,499
He saw it all and by
extension so did Vicky.

174
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,835
What was it like here as a kid?

175
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,737
It was fantastic.

176
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,805
Walking down the boardwalk in

177
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:10,910
the summertime was like
walking a carnival at midway.

178
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:14,080
There was still
remnants of the 20s.

179
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:14,847
Yeah.

180
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:20,052
Handle bar mustaches,
Victorian graphic art and

181
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,387
illustration was still very much

182
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:24,924
in evidence, even in my
time here in the early 60s.

183
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,158
The boardwalk was over six miles

184
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,529
of amusements, entertainments,
parades, and pageants.

185
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,565
A never-ending carnival.

186
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,835
Every place you went down the

187
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:36,903
boardwalk was something else to

188
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,771
see and all the stores were mom

189
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,439
and pop stores, all very unique.

190
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,074
Yes.

191
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:46,746
The world famous steel pier,

192
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:50,182
amusement arcades,
salt water Taffy.

193
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,118
I loved the joke shops.

194
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,020
The joke shops.

195
00:10:54,021 --> 00:11:00,126
It was a wonderland of
juvenile delinquency.

196
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,796
It was just something very
sinister and forbidden.

197
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,632
The menu has changed
somewhat since the original.

198
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:12,438
For me, a very tasty pretzel

199
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:17,744
crusted swordfish
over lump crab meat.

200
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,146
For Vicky, pan-seared scallops.

201
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:24,717
Times were not good.

202
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:29,221
It was largely empty, but it
was a magnificent structure.

203
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,824
You and I like the nostalgia.

204
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,760
The people who like coney island

205
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,062
like it, but I don't know
about the young people.

206
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,899
Beautiful buildings are
beautiful buildings.

207
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,070
A beautiful view is a
beautiful view forever.

208
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,404
There's no other place with this

209
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,907
kind of history and legitimacy.

210
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,242
This place has deep
romantic allure.

211
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,343
I agree with you.

212
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,145
I believe in the
transition that's coming.

213
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,982
I really, really do
with all my heart.

214
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,250
Hundreds of businesses
used to be here.

215
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,453
It's not a matter of, gee, that

216
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,289
would be great if
that happened again.

217
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,492
It is inevitable that
it will happen again.

218
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:11,297
Atlantic city can be chic easy

219
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,500
because the bones of the
city are beautiful.

220
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,269
I'm glad you feel that way.

221
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,272
A beautiful old restaurant
with really great food is much

222
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:28,273
more interesting than a
glass box with good food.

223
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,003
The names of Atlantic city
streets were imprinted on

224
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:56,175
generations of Americas who
grew up playing monopoly.

225
00:12:56,176 --> 00:13:00,312
You see history, the ebb and
flow of America's hopes and

226
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:06,152
dreams played out in the
buildings and homes you see as

227
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,021
you pass by.

228
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,390
Cheap takeout, the
footprints of a lost world.

229
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:16,395
The riviera of the northeast
still there if you look in

230
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:16,663
between.

231
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:20,499
With jet travel in Miami and an

232
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,102
expanded highway system,
things declined as they do.

233
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,839
But a few visionary geniuses
presented a solution, a cure

234
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,009
that would overnight make
everybody well, make Atlantic

235
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,913
city shiny and new and
prosperous again.

236
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,014
Men like Donald Trump.

237
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:41,420
I think it's going to be
really very beneficial to

238
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,354
everybody.

239
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,857
We look forward to operating the

240
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,526
Taj Mahal for many
years to come.

241
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:51,630
They rushed to Atlantic city
eager to tap into what was

242
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:59,631
assured to be a never-ending
gusher of prosperity, casino

243
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:00,373
gambling.

244
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:04,410
When casino gambling was sold

245
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,045
to New Jersey and to Atlantic

246
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:13,152
city as the cure-all,
did it change anything?

247
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,554
Do you think it helped?

248
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,322
No, I don't.

249
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:20,259
Brian Donohue is with 20
years experience focusing on

250
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,994
south Jersey.

251
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:27,766
Dock's oyster house, an
establishment that survived

252
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:31,003
prohibition, two world wars,

253
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,305
numerous declines, and rebirths.

254
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:39,645
Still here, still great, a
symbol of what Atlantic city

255
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:44,783
was, should be, and
should be again.

256
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,252
It was seen as an easy answer.

257
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,521
It sure sounded
like a good idea.

258
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,258
They were going to bring 12

259
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,460
casinos here and bring everybody
up from the top down.

260
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,527
It hasn't worked.

261
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:59,431
When you're left with
just 12 casinos...

262
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:04,937
If you're looking for an example
of lemming like lurch of

263
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,273
cliff face from which to tumble,

264
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:12,644
look no further than this
$2.4 million goat rodeo.

265
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,315
It opened in 2012 and closed
less than two years later.

266
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:23,455
The most expensive casino
in en engine history.

267
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,158
What were they thinking?

268
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,460
Short-term money at a time

269
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:32,298
when other casinos were opening
all over the east coast.

270
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,966
It's nuts.

271
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,467
It's economics 101.

272
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,470
Casinos, by design, neglect

273
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:44,810
the city's assets, salt air,
a walk by the glorious north

274
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:48,747
Atlantic, the classic
attractions, the restaurants.

275
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,316
This is what it is going to

276
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,984
take for Atlantic
city to come back.

277
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,519
It's going to be
places like this.

278
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,853
Celebrate the ghosts.

279
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:59,425
Some nice crab cakes at dock's,
a big freaking lobster

280
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:05,331
stuffed with crab imperial,
plum sou souffle.

281
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,666
Those things are bad for
business, the business of taking

282
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:08,001
your money.

283
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,402
Thank you so much.

284
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,572
That'll work.

285
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,740
That's good.

286
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:15,874
I don't want to sound like I'm

287
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,677
down on Atlantic city, because I

288
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:26,678
see it as an incredibly almost
ludicrously hopeful place.

289
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:31,723
Whatever is left should be hung

290
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:36,962
onto because it is
going to come around.

291
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:43,402
There's nothing funny about
losing all your money, yet

292
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:51,403
casinos are steady employers
of that most hard-working

293
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:52,644
entertainer.

294
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,414
It's so much money to live here.

295
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:59,085
I drove three exits on
the Jersey turnpike.

296
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,753
It was $7.

297
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,923
If you drive a whole New Jersey

298
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,392
turnpike, when you get to the

299
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:09,328
end you have to
give them your car.

300
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,632
I'm going to tell you
something that I don't tell

301
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,734
people right away.

302
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:19,171
I'm vegan.

303
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,639
I do cheat a little.

304
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,407
I eat veal.

305
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,474
It's so tender.

306
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:28,414
How do they get it like that?

307
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:32,518
I'm very sentimental about
Jersey Italian, particularly

308
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,952
spaghetti and meatballs.

309
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:38,924
I've eaten here at least five

310
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:43,095
to ten times and I've
never had a bad meal.

311
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,597
I wouldn't get the meatballs.

312
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:50,602
Proud long-time residents
of New Jersey.

313
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:56,942
I've lived here for nine years,
but have only been proud

314
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:57,344
for the last two.

315
00:17:57,345 --> 00:17:59,778
One was the first time you
played Atlantic city?

316
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,847
There was a club at the sands.

317
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,382
Many times I would get paid on

318
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,816
Thursday and then I would lose

319
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,654
it all and then I'd
have to work for free.

320
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,055
There's no worse feeling.

321
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,124
Oh, I know that feeling.

322
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,461
Have you ever watched a
couple in Atlantic city?

323
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:16,328
Hold this money.

324
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,131
Don't give it back to
me no matter what I do.

325
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:23,735
An hour later, give
me my god damn money.

326
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,637
You better give me my money.

327
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,974
You're the reason I'm losing,
touching my arm when I'm

328
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,742
shooting craps.

329
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,545
Is there a specifically
Jersey sense of humor?

330
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:36,982
Yes, I love Jersey
audiences now so much.

331
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:41,086
I have never one time said
anything where people in the

332
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,322
audience have said, ahhh.

333
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,690
They never get offended.

334
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,692
I have my trigger words.

335
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,561
As a white woman, the
word I don't like is no.

336
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:53,832
I don't hear it that often,
but when I do huh-uh.

337
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,235
Here's the deal with Jersey.

338
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,938
People land up north and
they drive up the turnpike.

339
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,207
Refineries.

340
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,741
That's New Jersey.

341
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,744
How sick is it that I
think it's beautiful?

342
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:12,618
More horses per capita
than any other state.

343
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:20,619
I worked for an
embroidery company.

344
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,429
I swear to god.

345
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,031
I'll call her right now.

346
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,200
Will people ever come across

347
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,136
the bridge and the tunnel
in the other direction?

348
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,404
No.

349
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:32,605
No?

350
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:32,805
Okay.

351
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:35,707
I did not have to
think about that.

352
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,310
Let's go out to a
club in Jersey.

353
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,212
It's all relative.

354
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:43,215
A 6-year-old person is going I'm

355
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,384
getting the [ Muted
] out of this city.

356
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,553
There's your answer.

357
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,554
Never going to be you.

358
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,556
Where does hipness stop?

359
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,292
Hipness is overrated.

360
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,727
Yeah, it is overrated.

361
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,062
I love living here.

362
00:19:57,063 --> 00:20:01,166
Pine valley, the best golf
course in the country.

363
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,569
Trump... trump, I'm not a fan.

364
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,671
Who is?

365
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:13,672
Every minute that he walks,
the man has a certain... it's

366
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,820
like if you have
a disfigurement.

367
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,789
That's too much to ask
of me in trump's case.

368
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,923
I want to screen.

369
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,693
Do you know why he puts his
names on the building?

370
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:31,930
So the banks know which
ones to take back.

371
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,299
At least he's a humble guy.

372
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,800
Jesus.

373
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:57,689
There are few American cities,
places where things have

374
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,461
gone as disastrously wrong
as Camden, New Jersey.

375
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,364
It's like a poster child for

376
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,065
everything a city can screw up.

377
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:13,405
Once a manufacturing power
house, home to the New York

378
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:18,744
shipbuilding company,
a company town.

379
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:23,214
About 80,000 people
live here today.

380
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:30,088
That's the same number of
people employed in its heyday.

381
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:33,659
The entire police force
replaced by the state.

382
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,994
More than 1/3 of city residents

383
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:40,566
live below the poverty line.

384
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:41,067
Voter turnout not good.

385
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:43,335
If there's any place one can be

386
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,570
forgiven for just throwing your

387
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:49,775
hands up in the air and
giving up, it's here, but no.

388
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,878
Cities with serious problems

389
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:56,682
need extraordinary people and
Tawanda Jones is clearly an

390
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:57,683
extraordinary person.

391
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:00,852
When you give, especially to

392
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:04,623
someone who is really in need,

393
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:08,760
you know, I feel... it
makes me feel complete.

394
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:12,364
Her late grandfather Walter

395
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:17,302
green Jr. was a
former military man.

396
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,471
He was just like the protector.

397
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:22,874
If you need anything, you go to Mr.
Dynamite.

398
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,876
That was his nickname.

399
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:30,416
When Tawanda was 15, she was
asked to lead a local drill

400
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,383
team.

401
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:35,053
Unfortunately, it soon
lost his funding.

402
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:43,054
Walter purchased uniforms and
drums to get it its start.

403
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:49,401
Today CSS, the Camden
sophisticated sisters drill

404
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:54,440
team, which includes the
distinguished brothers in taps,

405
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,942
the almighty percussion sound,

406
00:22:56,943 --> 00:23:00,946
have over 320 participants.

407
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,014
Good job, babies.

408
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:03,749
Good job.

409
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,084
Clap it up for yourself.

410
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:10,321
Clap it up.

411
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:15,761
We meet at stalwart
Tony and Ruth steaks.

412
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:19,297
What was Camden like back
in the good ole days?

413
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:19,965
Oh, my god.

414
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:27,966
It was so different when...
Coming up when I was younger.

415
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:29,941
That sense of community
was strong back then.

416
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:34,780
You were talking about your
childhood as if it was a real

417
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:39,451
long time ago.

418
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:39,985
What the hell went wrong?

419
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,521
People can blame it on the

420
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:44,490
politics, but I think
that's too easy.

421
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:45,657
Know what your child is doing.

422
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:51,563
You're putting it
principally on the parents.

423
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:52,163
Absolutely.

424
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,865
This is tasty.

425
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,568
This is delicious.

426
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:00,405
So the conventional wisdom
seems to be get out of Camden.

427
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:01,707
Why are you still here?

428
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,342
Because the need is
still in Camden.

429
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,712
If every decent person leaves

430
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:09,515
Camden, then we never a chance.

431
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:10,749
In order to be a part of the

432
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,686
program, they have to maintain
a C average or better.

433
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,922
It's all about the academics.

434
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:21,026
It's all about
nurturing these kids.

435
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:27,766
What's right, what's wrong.

436
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,034
They believe this.

437
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:33,204
They say it so much
until it is embedded.

438
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:41,205
Tawanda has helped support it
with financial assistance.

439
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:44,182
Surprisingly with a group of a

440
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:52,183
national profile no lasting
support from official

441
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,392
organizations public or private.

442
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:55,861
Yet she perseveres.

443
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:58,029
We've been under
Bridges, everything.

444
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,965
Over 28 years, we've
been outside.

445
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:03,301
Their safety is the most
important to me, but it's been a

446
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,202
blessing and a curse.

447
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,872
You'll have the corner boys come

448
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,607
up and ask you are you having

449
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:12,578
practice outside today,
today is not a good day.

450
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:12,879
Okay.

451
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:13,145
All right.

452
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:14,112
Thank you very much.

453
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:14,780
That's nice.

454
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:15,947
I appreciate it.

455
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:16,548
Trust me.

456
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:19,885
How do you keep the
kids off the corner?

457
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,452
I'm quite aware that times

458
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,388
are hard, but I just try to show

459
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,223
them an alternative route.

460
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:28,059
There's so much more
out there than this.

461
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,397
Some call me major pain,
but it's all out of love.

462
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,265
They need to discipline in life

463
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,568
to go to work, to go to school.

464
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,571
They're doing it
because it's fun.

465
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:40,238
Right.

466
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,172
But it's hard.

467
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:41,973
Yeah.

468
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,341
You're asking people to do a

469
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,610
hard thing and they're doing it.

470
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:45,111
Yeah.

471
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:49,748
And I got to ask, I'm going
to guess in the years that

472
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:53,084
you've been doing this you've

473
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,754
had to have had your
heartbroken many times.

474
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,455
You've had to see kids that

475
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,257
you've really believed in fall

476
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:02,127
by the wayside and
I'm guessing a lot.

477
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,161
How do you go on?

478
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:06,164
We have a lot of sad stories,

479
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,767
but our good outweighs the bad.

480
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,002
I keep going just
for that reason.

481
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,271
You know, before I was a little

482
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:17,275
hard on myself and I used to

483
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:20,111
think that I could save all the

484
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:23,448
kids, I know that's
not the case.

485
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:27,452
I just do the best
that I can do.

486
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:31,790
And I just pray the next kid
doesn't fall by the wayside.

487
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,225
How do you not become cynical?

488
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,461
Do you harden your heart?

489
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:42,300
No, actually I have to
replenish myself or I'm not

490
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:46,071
going to be good to
them or my own family.

491
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,205
These kids are
precious cargo to me.

492
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:51,677
Some of them have the
responsibility of a

493
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:52,144
30-something-year-old.

494
00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:54,345
They're holding
down their homes.

495
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,848
25 years down the road, what

496
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,083
do you think Camden
is going to be like?

497
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,651
I'm praying that it turns

498
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:04,589
into the Camden that I remember,

499
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,824
and I know that I'm helping our

500
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,059
future leaders to become
a part of that change.

501
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,494
There's no doubt in my mind that

502
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,262
there's going to be
a positive Camden.

503
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:11,731
No doubt.

504
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:13,031
You're going to say?

505
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,333
I'm not going anywhere.

506
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,235
My pop-pop didn't leave.

507
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:23,408
I'm not leaving.

508
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,111
Yeah, I know.

509
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,412
Philadelphia is
right over there.

510
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:30,448
Right across the Ben
Franklin bridge.

511
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,118
The center of the Cheesesteak

512
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,121
universe, but what if it isn't?

513
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,422
They're better than that.

514
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:39,190
They're bigger than that.

515
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:42,961
And the best Cheesesteak in the

516
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:45,964
area might well come
from new Jersey.

517
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:49,534
Donkey's opened by Leon
Lucas 71 years ago.

518
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:53,705
A heavyweight contender in the

519
00:27:53,706 --> 00:28:01,706
Olympics in boxing he was known

520
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:07,118
in his time of the
Calvary as the donkey.

521
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,387
This is what they do here.

522
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,323
Behold the Jersey Cheesesteak.

523
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,325
Pleasure to meet you.

524
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:17,929
So this is the best
Cheesesteak in south Jersey,

525
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,297
unless I'm mistaken?

526
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,799
New Jersey.

527
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,802
New Jersey, period?

528
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:24,937
Yeah.

529
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,072
Is there a difference?

530
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:34,813
We do ours on a round
Poppy seed roll.

531
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:35,914
It's round.

532
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,750
It's got steak, spices, browned

533
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,018
onions, real American cheese,

534
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,520
such as it is, and
a Poppy seed roll.

535
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,089
Fantastic.

536
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,157
Thank you, sir.

edges, when necessary it will

00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:23,828
And that has got to be the
most butt ugly building ever.

719
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,996
I noticed last night that some
of the lights on the sign

720
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:28,065
of the building are out.

721
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,133
Like truck.

722
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,501
Something like that.

723
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:31,802
Or tump.

724
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,270
Or rump.

725
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,172
It is perfect, actually, if you

726
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:43,173
think of Trump as carnival
barker, and empty, a perfect

727
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,283
metaphor here.

728
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,366
I hate sweets.

729
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,769
But I'm a sucker for nostalgia.

730
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,170
You can't go back.

731
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,638
I can't go back.

732
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,207
How I wouldn't, even if I could.

733
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,478
I sure don't want to ever
have to be a teenager again.

734
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,812
But those tastes and smells of

735
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:17,482
childhood, they work still.

736
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:20,317
You're telling me you were not
a big saltwater Taffy fan.

737
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,319
I remember it was hard to chew.

738
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,488
You had braces, remember?

739
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,456
This was probably
problematic for it.

740
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:27,558
I can't remember having
braces at that point.

741
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:31,496
These have a
mystical hold on me.

742
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:33,030
Even the color of the wrapper

743
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,032
has this weird, you know, like

744
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:38,336
there should be music
playing in the background.

745
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,074
Molasses, I remember that.

746
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,210
Getting a bunch of those.

747
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:47,211
I don't know why.

748
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:50,080
Certain flavors really resonate.

749
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:55,820
The peanut, I know exactly
what that tastes like.

750
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:58,489
I remember the vanilla
really powerfully.

751
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,824
I'm not even a vanilla guy.

752
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:03,227
I'm more of a chocolate guy.

753
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,995
I think I remember pink ones.

754
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:08,432
They must have had strawberry.

755
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,868
Winter green I remember.

756
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:13,437
Licorice sounds good.

757
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,438
Peppermints.

758
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,707
Keep these in the car.

759
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:17,374
Cookies and creme.

760
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,778
Does it melt?

761
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,046
That's a lot of Taffy.

762
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:24,448
Yeah.

763
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:25,883
This stuff isn't bad for you.

764
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,251
Eat as much as you want.

765
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,786
Is it gluten free?

766
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:30,020
It's all natural.

767
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:38,021
That's what I thought.

768
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:50,474
Atlantic city will never die.

769
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:55,212
Good is indeed good forever.

770
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:58,616
And Atlantic city
will be great again.

771
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:06,617
Asbury park, Camden,
all of my home state.

772
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:10,795
I'm convinced when the tide has

773
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:12,563
come and washed all the greed

774
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:19,103
heads away, we'll
once again be magic.

775
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:22,073
I hope I'm there to see it.
