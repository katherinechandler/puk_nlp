1
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:04,804
I didn't even think about it.

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:08,808
About death.

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:14,981
But shooting at those things,

4
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:17,550
anybody in the camera was shot.

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:17,851
Immediately.

6
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:21,221
By a Russian soldier.

7
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,390
At that time, I didn't
think about that.

8
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:30,963
But I found that I had
to think about it.

9
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,499
You were alive and holding a

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,434
camera at a very important
time in history.

11
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:37,404
You had to think, I'm doing
something important.

12
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:40,340
It's very easy to make
pictures, but pictures mean

13
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,408
something, what's in it.

14
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:45,478
That's a totally
different story.

You know these images.

You grew up with them.

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,965
They're burned into your brain.

25
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,869
Their iconic sequences.

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,171
Framed and lit and scene through

27
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:47,840
the lens in ways that
changed filmmaking forever.

28
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:53,180
All made by the same man.

29
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:55,415
So, who made these
beautiful things?

30
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,650
Where did he come from?

31
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,552
It didn't begin in Hollywood.

32
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:07,553
It began here, in the
streets of Budapest.

33
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:17,597
What about his life, his past,

34
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:23,276
his upbringing led him again and

35
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,845
again to look through a piece of

36
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:33,720
glass and make
images like these.

37
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:36,856
But first, some context.

38
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:37,457
And schnitzel.

39
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:45,458
Did I mention schnitzel?

40
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,773
It's beautiful here.

41
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:57,744
They say that, of course,
that Budapest is beautiful.

42
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:05,745
But it is, in fact, almost
ludicrously beautiful.

43
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,822
A riot of gorgeous architectural

44
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:14,461
styles, palaces, grand public
spaces, former mansions of

45
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:16,296
various princelings, the remains

46
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:21,534
of a long-gone
empire, still here.

47
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,002
Still here.

48
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:24,103
If there was such a thing as

49
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,338
building porn, it would be this.

50
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,474
Just looking out the window as

51
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:30,610
you drive or trolley by,
you think, I want that.

52
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,511
Who lives there?

53
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:32,979
Who lived there?

54
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,814
What's it like inside?

55
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:42,815
And where did they go?

56
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,861
From high up Gellard hill, you

57
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,030
get a sense of the
layout of the city.

58
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,267
Divided, split by the Danube

59
00:03:54,268 --> 00:04:01,708
river, Buda on one side,
Pest on the other.

60
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,676
Hungary divided in two.

61
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:09,148
Literally a
crossroads of worlds.

62
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:13,185
Which is which?

63
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,020
If you look down,
you're in buda.

64
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:18,725
If you look up, you're in Pest.

65
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,192
According to the myth I was

66
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,395
brought up, if you are in buda,

67
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,664
you're in Europe and the
other side is Asia.

68
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:29,969
This is the border of the
Roman empire, originally.

69
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,338
This big river.

70
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,972
Why didn't they cross?

71
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,241
The other side is flat, it's

72
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:38,244
hard to defend and there were
all these tribes that were

73
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,913
vicious and not as civilized as

74
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,715
the Romans believed they were.

75
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:48,555
They've all been here, the
settles, the Romans, the

76
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,189
mongols, the ottoman Turks.

77
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,658
All had their way or tried.

78
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:59,659
All left their Mark to
one extent or another.

79
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:01,168
♪

80
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:09,169
Then mid-19th century, the
curious, seemingly improbable

81
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:10,410
Austro-Hungarian empire.

82
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:11,744
This is when the city came into

83
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:16,583
its open, fueled by untold
wealth, accumulated power, and

84
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:17,684
ambition.

85
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,452
Architecturally,
intellectually, a great city.

86
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,953
One of the world's greatest.

87
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:25,792
And that was a time
when Budapest was a really

88
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,960
progressive Metropolis.

89
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:31,464
The first subway in the
continent of Europe was in

90
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:31,965
Budapest.

91
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,133
Parliament had like a very
sophisticated air-conditioning

92
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:34,402
system.

93
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:36,102
So people wanted to come, they

94
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,738
wanted to live here,
wanted to start a career.

95
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:46,379
Wanted to build places like
this, because it was a good

96
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,380
investment.

97
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,147
The New York cafe is one of

98
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,582
the last remnants of a society

99
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,751
where artists and writers were

100
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:55,054
valued citizens, regardless
of financial means.

101
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:59,125
When this cafe was built,

102
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,127
there were more than 500
cafes in this neighborhood.

103
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,662
And this was the biggest and

104
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,131
nicest cafe in the
world at the time.

105
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:05,965
Never to be closed.

106
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,000
Here, like in most cafes at

107
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,403
that time, a few cents or a few

108
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,138
bucks could buy you space all

109
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,008
day long, sipping your coffee,
thinking great thoughts.

110
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,343
Nobody would hassle you.

111
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:20,947
It was a petri dish
of creativity.

112
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,182
No hipster neck beard barista

113
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,852
would make you feel bad about
not speaking any dough.

114
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,988
Waiters were speaking
several languages and you read

115
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,257
literature and they invited the

116
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,324
writer, occasionally, if he

117
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,026
didn't have money, because they

118
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,361
appreciated their literature.

119
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,196
Where are we now
compared to there?

120
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:40,299
Don't try that now, of course.

121
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,636
Today's new-York cafe patrons

122
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,205
spend both their time and money

123
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:52,211
on things like goose
liver tegrine.

124
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,847
Foie gras is all over Hungary.

125
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:55,682
And it's good.

126
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,950
Real good.

127
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,719
Peter's going for the soup.

128
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,220
If you looked like a writer,

129
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,555
they would bring you paper and

130
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,790
ink, bring you a dictionary.

131
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,057
Also, most people didn't have

132
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,226
telephones at home and you
could be called here.

133
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,395
Why do I want to
attract writers?

134
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:15,234
It's like, I need more jazz
musicians on my register.

135
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,202
It was a different time.

136
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:19,271
It was not simply
about the money.

137
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,910
So it was about identity.

138
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:24,111
Yeah.

139
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:28,515
We want to be the place
that attracts the best and the

140
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:28,782
brightest.

141
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,249
Yeah.

142
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,650
Even if they don't have money.

143
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,151
Yeah.

144
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:33,185
Those days will never return.

145
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,821
Yeah, those days
will never return.

146
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,188
Lovely, thank you.

147
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,760
For the main courses, Peter
gets the filet of perch.

148
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,762
I'm going for the pork throttle

149
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,532
stew, mostly because I like
the sound of throttle.

150
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,033
That is beautiful.

151
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,834
That makes me very happy.

152
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:51,270
If I were to ask most
Hungarians, when were the good

153
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,005
old days?

154
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,708
You would have the answer.

155
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,346
Of course, it's not all
foie gras and fine wines.

156
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:05,785
There are other pleasures,
just as awesome.

157
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:12,358
Maybe, maybe even more awesome.

158
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,039
Like this.

159
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:19,432
Plesharda.

160
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:27,433
A smokey, chilly working class

161
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,611
joint run for the last 25
years and beloved by locals.

162
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,979
A long time coming.

163
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,917
A golden brown pancake
happied with chicken livers,

164
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:38,585
covered, nay, drowned with a

165
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:43,656
rich, deeply satisfying
sauce of bone marrow.

166
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,424
I've got to tell
you, this is great.

167
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,659
Some of you have noticed and

168
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,594
complained that I don't really

169
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,528
describe food
anymore, on the show.

170
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,964
This is a deliberate strategy
on my part, actually.

171
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,066
It's really a lot
like writing porn.

172
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:58,170
After you've used the same
adjectives over and over, look

173
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,973
at it, it's chicken liver, bone

174
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,174
marrow, a delicious pancake.

175
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,475
Is this going to make your life

176
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:07,513
better at all if I describe
exactly how while smacking my

177
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:10,182
lips and annoying you?

178
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:10,350
No.

179
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,651
It's good.

180
00:09:10,652 --> 00:09:18,652
Venison stew, delicious.

181
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:26,165
And then this.

182
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:26,366
This.

183
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,669
Good... holy... really?

184
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,503
Good lord!

185
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,639
This I need a photo of.

186
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,373
Put a human hand next to it.

187
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,875
That's just truly terrifying.

188
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,543
Who eats that?

189
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,647
Behold the massiveness, the

190
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:41,480
surf board-sized fried to order

191
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:45,718
in a pan to only the highest

192
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,154
standards schnitzel of justice.

193
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:52,524
Ride that, baby,
all the way home.

194
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,359
Yeah.

195
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,529
Oh, that's good.

196
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,899
Extra pork flavor.

197
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,203
Hints of day-old friar.

198
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,905
I could surf this thing
back to my hotel.

199
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:06,706
I kid you not.

200
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,308
This is a testament
to a great culture.

201
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,310
Also gout.

202
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:15,815
But who's counting?

203
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,851
Do I get a T-shirt
if I finish this?

204
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,790
Or my picture on the wall?

205
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:38,871
We are, all of us, perhaps,
called to serve a higher

206
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:39,272
purpose.

207
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:42,775
Put here on earth to do
god's mysterious will.

208
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,111
Daniel Matta is here for this.

209
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,747
To spread the gospel of meat.

210
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,750
Hungarian meat-related wisdom in

211
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,954
all its delicious,
delicious variety.

212
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,357
Like St. Francis of Assisi, he

213
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,526
wanders the earth,
doing good works.

214
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:04,964
In this case, highlighting the
ancient arts of butchery,

215
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:08,968
sausage making, and the
preparation of many of the

216
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,236
Lord's creatures.

217
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:18,237
As he, himself, would no doubt
like to see them prepared.

218
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,284
What have you heard
about Budapest butchers?

219
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,754
Not much.

220
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:29,655
We have about seven
butchers in Budapest.

221
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:30,990
Seven?

222
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,894
You can find us on a small
dorn with roasted meats.

223
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:35,828
It's very.

224
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,396
In five minutes, you can find

225
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,565
a butcher where you
can eat something.

226
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:47,173
And on this particular
corner, one of Daniel's

227
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:47,440
favorites.

228
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,808
So, you are not a butcher.

229
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,077
You're not... no, no.

230
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,945
What is your... what do you the?

231
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,113
I am an economist.

232
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:58,150
I understand it, you go from

233
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,351
butcher shop from butcher
shop, investigating butchers.

234
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,186
Why do you do that?

235
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:07,126
Because I like it.

236
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,261
And I thought, I'm
not alone with this.

237
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,497
So we should make a fan club.

238
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,632
And it started to
rise on Facebook.

239
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:17,603
Nearly 10,000 likes.

240
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,872
It's so unusual that
there are so many.

241
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:23,342
Because in France, Germany,
in the states, the old school

242
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,445
butchers who know how to do
all of these things, they're

243
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:26,780
disappearing.

244
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:28,214
Their kids aren't doing it.

245
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:32,819
It's not so easy to be
a butcher now in Hungary.

246
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:39,225
But with this catering function
doing prepared foods.

247
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,660
They try to save themselves.

248
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,830
Yes, there are many boutique

249
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:46,899
cuts of meat available, as one
would expect from a master

250
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,234
butcher.

251
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:48,000
But then there's this.

252
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,836
A field of dreams.

253
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,637
A landscape of braised and fried

254
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,540
and cured delights that seem,

255
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,675
under glass, to go on forever.

256
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,846
A good Hungarian butcher shop,
they should be able to cut

257
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:01,513
meat, cure meat, make sausage,

258
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,982
and cook preparations as well.

259
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:03,582
Yeah.

260
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,416
Look at that.

261
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,251
There he goes.

262
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,819
So beautiful.

263
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,321
There's no comparison
with a supermark.

264
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:12,691
Plus, you can ask him,
what's good today.

265
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,127
Today... oh, look,
what great timing.

266
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,563
They're making one
of my favorites.

267
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,498
Blood sausage.

268
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,734
You have to say in
English, because I can't.

269
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,702
Paprika.

270
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,504
Paprika.

271
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,706
Oregano.

272
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:28,207
Thyme.

273
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,412
Marjoram.

274
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,113
All spice.

275
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,447
Here comes the rice.

276
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,715
Here comes the blood.

277
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,884
Here comes the blood.

278
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:40,853
Beautiful, so good.

279
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:41,188
Salt.

280
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:42,121
And the sugar.

281
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:42,955
I don't understand why.

282
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,458
It makes flavors pop.

283
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:46,726
Beautiful.

284
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:51,964
Seasoned and right
into the tube.

285
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:58,971
Stand by for big jokes.

286
00:13:58,972 --> 00:13:59,638
All right.

287
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,073
So what do we have here?

288
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,474
Oh, that looks good.

289
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,775
Some nice pickles.

290
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:04,911
Braced red cabbage.

291
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:11,783
Over there, from the mighty
shanks of some mythical

292
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,319
creature, perhaps, slow braced

293
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,155
until the meat is
falling off the bone.

294
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,425
And let there be blood,
delicious, delicious blood, in

295
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:23,662
tube form, served, still
steaming, nay, heaving,

296
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,297
engorged, as you will, with

297
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,832
goodness, to squirt across your

298
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,601
plate as you press against it
with the side of your fork.

299
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,602
So delicious.

300
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,304
So how often do you do?

301
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,940
Two or three times a week.

302
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:40,512
What distinguishes a good
butcher from an okay butcher?

303
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,681
They're doing
good business here.

304
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,351
That is true.

305
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,185
Yeah?

306
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,520
I can't tell you which
is my favorite butcher.

307
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,689
All of them are different.

308
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,124
Right.

309
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,459
Do you ever just going
out for like a salad?

310
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,026
No.

311
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:54,911
I kid, I kid.

312
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:10,176
There is another long
tradition of artistry here in

313
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:10,443
Budapest.

314
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:13,212
We grew up with their works.

315
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:18,584
Visual artists,
photographers, filmmakers.

316
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,620
Where did they all go?

317
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:27,459
Well, world war I happened
and with it, the end of the

318
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,327
Austro-Hungarian empire.

319
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,895
Budapest and all Europe
changed forever.

320
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:32,999
A decades-long wave
of emigration began.

321
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,167
A stunning number of the world's

322
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,735
great photographers fled their

323
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:40,572
native Hungary and
took up new lives.

324
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:46,045
Eventually, this
man joined them.

325
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:49,415
I've been shooting photos since
I remember I was living.

326
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,885
I was 5 or 6 years old when I
was taking pictures with my

327
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:54,987
father's Kodak camera.

328
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,755
The right moment, you
have to capture.

329
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:04,756
And that's the difficult
part the exact moment.

330
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:11,903
Hungarians, there is
this need to excel.

331
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:15,441
My father was not
really an artist.

332
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,542
He was a soccer player.

333
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,944
A very good one.

334
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:21,847
He said, son, whatever you do,

335
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:25,851
you have to be the best at it.

336
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:29,688
First, not second, you
have to be first.

337
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:37,689
Otherwise it's not worth it.

338
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:48,307
Vilomo Zigma.

339
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,042
Legendary cinematographer.

340
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,978
If you don't know his
name, you know his work.

341
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,781
The Oscar-winning
"close encounters."

342
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:56,882
"The deer hunter."

343
00:16:56,883 --> 00:17:01,487
His evolutionary work on
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller."

344
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,256
"The long good-bye."

345
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:04,591
"Deliverance."

346
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:06,658
He created a whole new palette,

347
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,760
took crazy risks, changed film

348
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:13,299
language in ways people
still try to imitate.

349
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,634
And he's making our camera crew

350
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:19,938
very nervous, I can tell you.

351
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,142
You taught yourself to shoot.

352
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,445
Basically, I always tried to

353
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:32,184
use my father's Kodak camera.

354
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,286
It's a kidney disease.

355
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,923
I was in bed for a month and an

356
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:45,131
uncle of mine gave me a book
about a great photographer.

357
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:49,535
And I started to take
just amateur pictures.

358
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:53,672
One thing that hasn't changed
through the years is the

359
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,375
Hungarian affection for taking
the waters, marinading in

360
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,543
thermal baths, a tradition going

361
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,211
back to the Romans, continued by

362
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01,046
the ottomans, and something that

363
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,315
survived right through
two wars and communism.

364
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,684
And they do it in style.

365
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:09,221
Who came here?

366
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,156
Back in those days?

367
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:12,124
Was this reserved for anyone who

368
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,626
wanted to could come here?

369
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:20,732
Well, you know, money wise,

370
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,969
everyone before did
basically what was cheap.

371
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,736
Right.

372
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,339
In hungry, we have so many spas.

373
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,077
There are many bathhouse spas.

374
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,512
Baroque, elaborately wedding

375
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,815
cakes, built atop mineral rich

376
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:42,521
hot Springs gurgling
from the earth.

377
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,623
None more storied
than the Geller.

378
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,092
You arrived in
Budapest around age 21.

379
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,561
What was the city like then?

380
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:55,601
It was always beautiful.

381
00:18:55,602 --> 00:19:00,706
There were ruins after the war.

382
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:05,010
Half of the city was
still in ruins.

383
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,445
When you first moved here,

384
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:10,249
you go to film school, what was

385
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,184
your average day like
other than your studies?

386
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,853
What did you do for
fun back then?

387
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:15,387
What were your options?

388
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:22,694
Our options were zero.

389
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:26,097
Imagine from little help
from the government.

390
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,065
Very little money.

391
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,568
Enough to have breakfast and

392
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:33,972
lunch or breakfast and dinner.

393
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,742
You had to skip lunch
for a pair of socks.

394
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:39,611
So we were very, very poor.

395
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:47,612
But I must say that under this

396
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:52,924
whole thing, the happiest part

397
00:19:52,925 --> 00:20:00,299
of my life was when I fell
in love, immediately.

398
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,501
In fact, some of Vilmos' most

399
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,970
powerful and world-changing
footage occurred around this

400
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,838
time, before leaving Hungary, as

401
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,609
a film student during the
outbreak of revolution.

402
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,979
But we'll get to that later.

403
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:40,799
In many ways, Viloms Zigma's
career as one of the great

404
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,809
photographers in
cinematography begins here.

405
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:50,316
Here he was raised by his
father, who worked many jobs to

406
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,051
make ends meet.

407
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,620
Weekends in warmer months all

408
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,655
over Hungary, wherever there's a

409
00:20:56,656 --> 00:21:00,025
river and fish, places like this

410
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,460
are thronging with families.

411
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:07,399
And here along the Tisa
river is no exception.

412
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,801
Here Vilmos and his dad would

413
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,304
come and eat the local
specialty of soup.

414
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,573
How old were you when you
first came to this place?

415
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:20,679
I must have been
about 7 years old.

416
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,181
You know, my father
was really great.

417
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,651
Those days, years, actually, he

418
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:31,357
didn't have much time, but
occasionally, he wants to take

419
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,558
me away, away from work.

420
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,360
He loved this place, actually.

421
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:39,197
He loved this,
especially this fish.

422
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,534
That's murky and good-looking

423
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:47,839
and need some bread
for this, for sure.

424
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,874
Pike from the river simmered

425
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,411
low and slow in a rich fish
stock with healthy amount of

426
00:21:52,412 --> 00:22:00,412
onions and the near you pick we

427
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:07,058
to us but always good paprika.

428
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,059
That's good.

429
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,461
On the summer, in the side.

430
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,196
Then go swimming in the river.

431
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,230
It was a great place.

432
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:20,038
Used to be a great
place for fun.

433
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,972
And you know at night, we

434
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:24,410
used to come here at night, when

435
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:25,944
the gypsies were playing music.

436
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,146
And I loved that, actually.

437
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:36,147
I always loved gypsy music.

438
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:40,759
They had a very happy childhood.

439
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,796
Good times until, until the war

440
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:50,669
got in and then stopped all
that happiness, you know?

441
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,406
There was just hard times.

442
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:58,610
Were you fully aware of how
bad, how grave things were?

443
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,946
Near the end of the war, the

444
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:04,115
Germans came in and then
started to bomb us.

445
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:10,489
And they started to take Jews,

446
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,425
actually, to work in camps.

447
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:17,596
That started to be
very, very ugly.

448
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:20,799
For people of your
generation, who grew up, these

449
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,435
were incredibly insecure times.

450
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,035
Psychologically, what do you

451
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,105
think that teaches you
as far as a world view?

452
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,674
Do you become more adaptable?

453
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,609
Do you become more suspicious?

454
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,844
Do you become more cynical?

455
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:36,081
It's about survival, actually.

456
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:42,988
We want to survive as Siberians,
to preserve identity as

457
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:43,855
hung Hungarians.

458
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,724
So that's what we did.

459
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:46,058
And survived.

460
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:47,659
We saw a lot as a young boy,

461
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,461
as he would later, as an adult.

462
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:53,499
In 1944, German tanks
rolled into Hungary.

463
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,904
His country was now in the
hands of a foreign power.

464
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:04,510
It made me thinking
back to my school years.

465
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:08,046
I almost said those were the
happiest years of my life.

466
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:16,047
Being under a regime,
terrible things happened.

467
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:18,690
We were stuck.

468
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:22,427
Being in the film school was

469
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:23,862
like an island of the craziness.

470
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,664
I grew up in New Jersey.

471
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:27,198
My family was sentimental about

472
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,668
beautiful pictures,
a beautiful script.

473
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:33,204
We saw every film you ever shot

474
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,708
and talked about them
at the dinner table.

475
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:37,576
These were important.

476
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:38,710
This has got to look pretty

477
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:41,847
close to the way it did
in the old day, right?

478
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:42,881
Oh, yeah.

479
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,015
Doesn't change much.

480
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:48,353
Through it all for Vilmos
was this place, however.

481
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,956
A very special place for a boy
growing up during wartime.

482
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:54,059
The moviehouse where he
saw his first films.

483
00:24:54,060 --> 00:25:02,060
What memorable films did
you see in this theater?

484
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:09,407
My probably best experience
in my life, I was in Hungary,

485
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:13,211
see chaplain's "the dictator."

486
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,914
Democracy is fragrant.

487
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:16,615
Liberty stunk.

488
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:22,654
Liberty is odious.

489
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,524
Freedom of speech is objectable.

490
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,427
Chaplain did such a
great job, you know.

491
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:33,965
Some films, of course,
resonated more than others.

492
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:40,739
The power of the visual image

493
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,408
intensified by what was going
on outside that dark room.

494
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,978
Fills could be inspiring, but
they could be dangerous.

495
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,114
It was so magical, to go to a

496
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,416
film, especially a dangerous
one, one that was just the

497
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,485
subject matter and the content

498
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,255
was different and to see that

499
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,157
just, oh, my god, what do I do

500
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,159
with my life now
after seeing this?

501
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:07,399
This theater, by the way,
is now named in his honor.

502
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,383
When you look at footage you

503
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:28,119
took during the revolution,
you're not in those pictures,

504
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,821
but do you see yourself?

505
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:33,224
Do you remember
what it felt like?

506
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:37,328
I remember that I was
actually scared to death.

507
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,165
Shooting those, going
through there, should be.

508
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:43,669
I found I had to photograph it.

509
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,871
Things were going from one side

510
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,806
to the other side of the Danube.

511
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,207
There were tanks
coming across this?

512
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:53,211
Well, yes, actually.

513
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:59,417
It was a pretty cool,
cold day, too.

514
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:00,185
Yeah.

515
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,853
It was bad weather.

516
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:05,523
It was pretty much, you know,

517
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:09,094
you could see what was
happening in Budapest.

518
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,930
After the war, a cold war.

519
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,332
Hungary now found itself firmly

520
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,934
in the grip of the Soviet union.

521
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:23,935
Germans had been replaced
by Russian comisars.

522
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:34,552
Vilmos was now at film school
along with his best friend,

523
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:34,787
Laszlo.

524
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:37,823
Then in 1956, something
amazing happened.

525
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,525
Hated emblems of red tyranny

526
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,560
went down as hub guerin patriots

527
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:50,561
for ten glorious days sent
armored Russians which pitted

528
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,205
rifles against tanks.

529
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:58,076
The statue of Stalin used
to be under the first night,

530
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:00,411
actually, when the revolution

531
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,613
started, the people wanted
to take the statue down.

532
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,583
It took about a couple of hours,

533
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:09,921
actually, to get Mr.
Stalin's legs off.

534
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:17,462
And naturally, the next day,
people took pieces home as a

535
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:17,764
souvenir.

536
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:21,332
To date, this was something
that had never been done.

537
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:26,404
The Hungarians took
to the streets.

538
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,774
A revolution.

539
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:32,978
That's when Vilmos and Laszlo
and some pals snuck 35

540
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,179
millimeter cameras and film out

541
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,015
of their school's equipment
room, and at great risk to

542
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,184
themselves, joined their
countrymen in the streets,

543
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:42,253
documenting the revolt
and the aftermath.

544
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:46,624
These images are from some
of that historic footage.

545
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:49,627
It seemed for ten glorious days,

546
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,362
that freedom had finally come.

547
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:56,101
Encouraged by the west and
by CIA radio broadcasts in

548
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,804
particular, the Hungarians
believed that help was on its

549
00:28:58,805 --> 00:28:59,005
way.

550
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:01,139
That this was it.

551
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,374
They dug in and fought.

552
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:10,548
Hoping to hold out
until help arrived.

553
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:17,555
On November 4th, a desperate
plea went out over the air

554
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:17,790
waves.

555
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:21,860
This is Hungary calling.

556
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:26,464
This is Hungary calling.

557
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,233
For the sake of
god, help Hungary.

558
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,367
The Russians had been beaten

559
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,136
back for a time, but now they

560
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,838
doubled down with a vengeance,

561
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,639
pouring tanks and troops and

562
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,144
heavy armor back into Budapest
and brutally and all too

563
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:42,080
effectively put down
the resistance.

564
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,014
Help never came.

565
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:46,918
This is a place where a
lot of things happened.

566
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,153
Used to be the headquarters.

567
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,889
I never shot this before, so

568
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,658
this is about the first time I'm

569
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,061
going to get this building shot.

570
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:59,097
So this was the internal
secret police, so if someone

571
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:01,332
came at night with a Van and he

572
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,903
were taken away, you ended
up being interrogated here?

573
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,104
Yes.

574
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,772
Secret police
headquarters in 1956.

575
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,008
The site of a firefight between

576
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,945
snipers on the roof, and
their fellow citizens below.

577
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:18,884
Then the people got into the

578
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:21,352
building, went up there, hunted

579
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:25,857
them down and killed them,
actually, basically.

580
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:27,458
And hanged them ton the streets.

581
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,727
Hung them here.

582
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,296
Hung them on the street.

583
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:32,630
It's hard to find a tree which

584
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:39,537
they hung those people up there.

585
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:45,310

before the revolution?

586

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:37,728
Do we emerge fully formed
with a god-given eye?

725
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:41,465
For pictures, images
that can move people?

726
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,601
Or are we the end result of all

727
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:46,436
the things we've seen, all the

728
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,140
things we've done, the places
we've been, the places, the

729
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:54,144
people we've had to leave
behind, all that's happened in

730
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:54,779
your life?

731
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,980
Is it those things that bring

732
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:59,617
the light or the the darkness
to the blank screen?

733
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:03,253
And what about the faces of
those we capture in our magic

734
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:08,392
lenses for a minute or
a second or an hour?

735
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:09,259
Afterwards should we think about

736
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:15,266
them and where
they might be now?
