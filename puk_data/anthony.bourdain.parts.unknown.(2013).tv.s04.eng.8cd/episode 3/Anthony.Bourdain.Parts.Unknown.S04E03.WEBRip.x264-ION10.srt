00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:17,710
I'm told you're a man
who can help me.

2
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:23,723
Some time in mid 19th century
1850s my great, great

3
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:31,724
grandfather immigrated
to south America.

4
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:38,838
Utopian dreams.

5
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,007
My aunt used to tell stories he

6
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:44,311
was into arms smuggling
or who knows, you know?

7
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:52,312
No idea.

8
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:10,963
♪

9
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,051
For most people Paraguay is

10
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:03,723
an empty space on the
lap of Latin America.

11
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,559
A country of only six million

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,829
where a vast percentage of the

13
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:17,830
land is steaming hot
jungle or a huge desert.

14
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,942
Only a few large cities offer a

15
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:30,943
respite from the
impressive heat.

16
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:46,266
A thousand miles up river
from the Atlantic ocean sits

17
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,269
Paraguay's remote capitol city

18
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,138
known largely for being a post

19
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,542
war refuge for freeing Nazis and

20
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:57,477
extremely unpleasant dictators.

21
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,945
This place of all places in the

22
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,614
world is where my great, great,

23
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,783
great grandfather disappeared

24
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:11,784
without explanation
sometime in 1850s.

25
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,795
I'm told your a man
that can help me.

26
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,297
How do you do?

27
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:19,399
May I call you Tony.

28
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,800
Please.

29
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,568
You're here for the first time.

30
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,336
First time in Paraguay, yes.

31
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,406
Lido bar has always been like
the central switchboard.

32
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:34,407
A gathering place.

33
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,251
Ladies in orange tanks serve

34
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:43,323
working class food to people
of every walk of life.

35
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,925
This place is very unique.

36
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:52,999
I've been here for
more than 50 years.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,169
Let's get something to eat.

38
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,008
It's beef, onion, and hard
cooked egg deep fried to

39
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:02,310
perfection.

40
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:03,543
Cattle is the big
business of this country.

41
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,946
It used to be cattle
and smuggling.

42
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,848
These days it's still cattle.

43
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:16,849
You see a lot of beef
is what I'm saying.

44
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,061
This is a mystery
to most people.

45
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:28,335
What we know comes Nazi's
and Germans and crimes.

46
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:32,805
Do you think that's an
undeserved reputation?

47
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:33,873
It's a nice country.

48
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:34,742
A beautiful country.

49
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:37,544
He was one of a team of
people I sent out looking for

50
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:40,212
the mysterious lost Bourdain.

51
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:46,719
What are you called upon to do?

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,555
Normally counterfeiting.

53
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,723
In the old days it's said much

54
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:54,093
of this counterfeiting had
partners in the government.

55
00:04:54,094 --> 00:05:02,094
Not so much anymore.

56
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,906
He was the last of his
kind in Paraguay.

57
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,509
Of German heritage he ruled the

58
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,612
country until 1989 with a quite

59
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:17,684
charm but behind the scenes was

60
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,686
another thing utilizing an

61
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:26,726
outfit of trained secret
police he to toured and tossed

62
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,028
of helicopters over the jungle.

63
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,129
The list goes on.

64
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,099
One in four was said to have

65
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,133
cooperated willingly or not as

66
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,769
paid informers on their
fellow citizens.

67
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,238
It's quite a history
in this country.

68
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,040
Crazy, tragic, violent.

69
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:45,778
Things are changing, a lot.

70
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:51,818
And now.

71
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,953
Sometime in the mid 19th

72
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:59,626
centuries or 1850s he immigrated

73
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:02,762
to south America, first
Argentina but apparently came

74
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:02,963
here.

75
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:10,964
That's really almost
all I know for sure.

76
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,408
Did he die of old age?

77
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,109
Did he die of syphilis?

78
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,310
I have no idea.

79
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,246
I'd like to know.

80
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:21,080
I'd like to find a grave site.

81
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,314
That would be great.

82
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,484
My father died at 57.

83
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,085
His father in his 20s I believe.

84
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,687
I'll be 58 in June.

85
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,490
I think I am the longest living

86
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:37,630
male Bourdain possibly ever.

87
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,599
You're lonely in the world?

88
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,701
I'm lonely in the world, yes.

89
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:45,472
If I could solve the mystery of

90
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:47,373
John Bourdain I would be happy.

91
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,541
It would be great if you found

92
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,010
out he owned a huge ranch and

93
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,545
they have been waiting for his

94
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,380
relatives to claim his property.

95
00:06:54,381 --> 00:07:02,381
Maybe not.

96
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,161
I am trying to make some
sense of this country.

97
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,897
You lived here how long?

98
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,199
22 years.

99
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,539
What a strange and nice country.

100
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,875
Go to Paraguay and find a
German to show you around.

101
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,712
Not so crazy or
unrepresentative.

102
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:30,550
People came to this country from

103
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,985
everywhere to as Emmerson called

104
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,220
it make their own world.

105
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,155
What's good to eat here?

106
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:40,660
I suppose you want
something Paraguay.

107
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,495
Yes.

108
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:47,900
It's rice with fried
beef with egg on top.

109
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:48,836
I'm there.

110
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:50,369
Good.

111
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:58,370
And there's a soup that is

112
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,179
very very old Paraguay stuff.

113
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,914
That looks good.

114
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:02,449
That looks very good.

115
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:02,750
Yeah.

116
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:10,751
That's good, man.

117
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,894
I'm trying to make some
sense of this country.

118
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,195
You lived here how long?

119
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,263
22 years.

120
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,098
Why did you come here
in the first place?

121
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:26,405
I was born in east Germany

122
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,741
and then in '89 the wall break

123
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,643
down and you say
wow, you will go.

124
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:31,711
I haven't seen anything of

125
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,312
this country yet but what I read

126
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,716
was the world's back water

127
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:37,784
filled with banked that had been

128
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:40,419
looted, institutions
that didn't work.

129
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,654
Every carried a gun.

130
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,723
It was like the
wild west but poor.

131
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:44,457
It's not that anymore.

132
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:50,462
A bit of this is true.

133
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:55,234
I by myself got a .45
on my head last week.

134
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:58,337
That's common for me.

135
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,438
Seldom have I seen a country

136
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,240
where one after the other you've

137
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:04,577
had the most insane suicidal

138
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:08,915
group of dictators
century after century.

139
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,984
You are right.

140
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,486
Even in times the better part of

141
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:18,457
Paraguay was behind him.

142
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,292
They're very very easy to

143
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,961
influence and business I believe

144
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:28,334
unchanged until a short time ago

145
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,370
now there is a growing
middle class.

146
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,939
Better education than before and

147
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:40,940
that makes the people say no.

148
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,852
How was the soup?

149
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,053
I liked it.

150
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,188
The way my wife cooks it.

151
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,823
I like it better with chicken.

152
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,293
But chicken is
more for Saturday.

153
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,484
Paraguay was a very poor

154
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,019
country. Spaniards came because

155
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,588
there was a lot of silver in the area.
They found none,

156
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:30,589
so they lost interest
in Paraguay.

157
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:41,373
This is the only country
in Latin America where the

158
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,010
indigenous language is
the official language.

159
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:49,015
I am married to a Paraguay

160
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,383
woman and when her fathers come

161
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:55,888
in they automatically talk that

162
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:03,889
and I'm more or less out.

163
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,570
El supremo.

164
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,105
Got to love it.

165
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,275
A nearly 200 year succession of

166
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,978
dictators began in 1811 when he

167
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:22,381
declared himself El
supremo for life.

168
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:27,754
He insisted Paraguay become
a mixed race society.

169
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:34,460
They're neither
Spanish nor Indians.

170
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:40,967
El supremos prevented marriage
between white and white.

171
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:45,772
Today 95% are of mixed blood.

172
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:49,275
And we usually speak
two languages.

173
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:55,081
Right.

174
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,783
This is the central market?

175
00:11:56,784 --> 00:12:04,784
This is the biggest one
and the most popular one.

176
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,337
I'm hungry.

177
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,272
What's good here?

178
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:25,778
We opted for a little catfish.

179
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:33,779
And okay the saying is that
it makes man very powerful.

180
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,224
What's he got?

181
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,625
That looks good.

182
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,494
There was a good Italian
influence in Paraguay.

183
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,797
So maybe this stew
comes from this.

184
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,198
It's from all over the world.

185
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:54,199
So you invite them and
get the catfish stew?

186
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,518
Could you pass me the soup.

187
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,754
The soup is very unique.

188
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,824
Our dictator Lopez's favorite

189
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,827
soup was corn soup and one day

190
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,395
he ordered his favorite soup and

191
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,998
the cook when he opened
the pot it was a cake.

192
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:24,403
Paraguay has not been noted
for its history of kinder,

193
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,771
gentler leaders.

194
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,240
In the 1800 two generations of

195
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:31,677
Lopez, father and son, one
dictator after the other

196
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,345
certainly left their
marks on this country.

197
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,780
Lopez was pretty much known

198
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:38,117
for putting a wrong
stamp on a letter.

199
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,185
You get shot.

200
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,420
So the cook didn't
want to get shot.

201
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:46,425
He showed up in front of Lopez

202
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:50,696
and says this is soup and the

203
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,298
dictator ate it and he liked it

204
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:56,735
and later the entire
country eat it.

205
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,604
So it's cheesey cornbread?

206
00:13:58,605 --> 00:13:58,872
Yeah.

207
00:13:58,872 --> 00:13:59,206
Awesome.

208
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:07,207
Good meal.

209
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,955
So this was the house or one

210
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,290
of the houses of madam lynch.

211
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,226
Exactly.

212
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:22,995
The journalist, poet, and
author has written books on

213
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:23,897
Paraguay's history.

214
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:26,165
Now who was madam lynch.

215
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,301
A murky background
would you say?

216
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:33,105
There's talk about that.

217
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,406
Somebody say she was a great

218
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,442
woman or she was
a very evil one.

219
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,778
She came over on the
famous trip from France.

220
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,247
Right.

221
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:44,483
In 1840s Lopez senior
reversed many of Paraguay's

222
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,585
isolationist policies.

223
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,955
He invited foreigners to settle

224
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:52,524
here and built one of south
America's first rail ways.

225
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,526
It's steam engines taken out of

226
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:58,630
service only a few years ago and

227
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,933
he sent his son to Europe.

228
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,970
His mission his father sent
him out to get what arms?

229
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:11,377
Arms and technicians,
engineers and machinery.

230
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:15,281
Junior by most contemporary
accounts was an idiot.

231
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:19,018
So he came back with a
mistress, madam lynch.

232
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:19,786
Yes.

233
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:20,620
Which dad wasn't
too happy about.

234
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:28,621
Right.

235
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:45,370
He was very traditional and
wanted his son to marry a

236
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,983
Paraguayan woman and do
everything by the book.

237
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:55,154
She was the daughter
of an Irish doctor.

238
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,556
Ambitious, social climbing,
fond of nice things.

239
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:05,331
Clothes imported from France.

240
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:13,332
And there were parties here.

241
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,277
He showed madam lynch to his

242
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,913
father and his father was
upset so she was put aside.

243
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,349
Kept as a mistress.

244
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,952
And that was the way society
tried to treat her and she

245
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,621
wanted to be treated
as the... Princess?

246
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:37,622
Yes.

247
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,433
Tell me about her
famous boat trip.

248
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:48,907
On one of her more notorious
adventures as hostess she

249
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:49,776
organized an outing.

250
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:52,144
She invited all of
society to join her.

251
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:52,745
Right.

252
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,314
The river steamer was
engaged for the party.

253
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,483
Well, there were some issues

254
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:05,484
between the ladies
and madam lynch.

255
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:13,232
Once on board they treated
their hostess like trash.

256
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:18,270
So she got upset and threw
over board all the food they

257
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,471
were supposed to eat.

258
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,407
She had it all
thrown in the river?

259
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:23,109
Yes.

260
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,576
Then she ordered the captain

261
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,945
to stop the boat and let her

262
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,748
guests just sit there in
that jungle heat for hours.

263
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:35,321
Throwing tubs of caviar and
whole roasted pigs into the

264
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,789
river in front of the
starving aristocrats?

265
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,759
Somehow that pleases me.

266
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,444
Going back to the very
beginnings, various groups with

267
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,279
stars in their eyes came here

268
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:08,280
seeking to create a utopia
along the lines, a paradise.

269
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,793
Repopulate Latin
America with Germans.

270
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:19,365
British, Italians,
you had everybody.

271
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:19,632
Yeah.

272
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:23,869
I had a great, great, great
grandfather come over to

273
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,971
Paraguay around the 1850s.

274
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,473
Right.

275
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:30,709
Might have been, myself, a

276
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:37,816
seeker of some kind
of utopian dreams.

277
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,551
Originally from France?

278
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,752
From France, yes.

279
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:41,388
What city?

280
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:41,921
Do you know?

281
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:48,059
My great, great, grandfather
was from near Bourdeax.

282
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:56,060
So I'm curious about
this settlement.

283
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:25,364
The Paraguay river still as
it was 150 years ago the

284
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:29,535
country's main artery.

285
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:37,536
A thoroughfare for
transporting people and goods.

286
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,714
Who lives out there?

287
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,884
Of all the people we see
fishing on the river banks.

288
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,386
Are they fishing for dinner?

289
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:51,723
Most of them are
fishing for dinner.

290
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,893
They decide by
themselves to live here.

291
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,562
They could go and start working
on a construction place

292
00:19:56,563 --> 00:20:02,568
tomorrow.

293
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:10,569
Peter organized a trip up
river to see new Bourdeaux.

294
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:16,748
What was hoped would
be a new France.

295
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,917
The fish today 14 kilo that's

296
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,686
half a month's salary and you

297
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:21,987
get with a bit of good
luck in one night.

298
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:29,988
Right.

299
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:57,956
Outside of the cities Paraguay
is sparsely populated.

300
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,359
Indigenous groups, a few settled

301
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,628
Europeans, Mennonites, Germans

302
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,465
and a fishing lure and
shotgun salesman.

303
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,634
What are the shotguns for?

304
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:12,871
Bandits?

305
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:13,139
Varmentes?

306
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,474
To hunt deer and water pig.

307
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:20,178
That's a peacemaker.

308
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:23,148
Any rogue Nazis
we can shoot now?

309
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:27,586
I am tempted by the offer of
a cheap shotgun for sale.

310
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:30,722
Figures Peter would know this
guy but reason wins out.

311
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:34,159
I don't think we're going
to buy a shotgun today.

312
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,330
Me, fear, shotgun,
shot sunny day.

313
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:46,331
That's not a good mix.

314
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,518
Unlike madam lynch's guests

315
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,853
I'm making sure I eat
on this boat trip.

316
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:05,624
The most important
part of my meal.

317
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,892
Cold, frosty beverages.

318
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:07,460
I started early.

319
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:07,960
Cheers.

320
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:15,961
Cheers.

321
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:23,208
Fish and a man goe salsa.

322
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:26,645
You have the two most
appreciated fish here on the

323
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,880
table of Paraguay.

324
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,650
That's the catfish.

325
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,885
And that's the... oh, of course.

326
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:34,487
Yes.

327
00:22:34,488 --> 00:22:40,726
That's tasty.

328
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,594
That's nice.

329
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:50,595
I'm curious about this whole
episode of the settlement.

330
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:57,743
They were supposed to be
most of them farmers.

331
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,411
But just 86 were farmers.

332
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:07,412
Who were the other people
they were Taylors and

333
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:08,555
shoemakers.

334
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:14,593
They were put in the jungle
and left by himself.

335
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:15,994
Right.

336
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,596
Why here of all the
people in the world.

337
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:23,001
People talk about it as a hell.

338
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:29,274
It's hot here... it's dry,
it's red, it's difficult.

339
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,209
You have all the mosquitos.

340
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:39,210
A flatland of cactus
and thorns and misery.

341
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:53,298
There's a part where you enter
the country you are good

342
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:53,500
food.

343
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:56,367
Did they ever see
this as utopia?

344
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:04,368
No, I'm sure not.

345
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,077
That?

346
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:05,545
This.

347
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:13,546
Wow that's not how
I pictured it.

348
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:22,153
Doesn't look like
Bordeaux to me.

349
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,731
There's nothing much left.

350
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:33,338
I'm told a small museum
of artifacts.

351
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:37,843
The site where it once existed.

352
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:40,011
It was money for each settler.

353
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,713
Perhaps there was a
communication break down

354
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,081
somewhere and he might have told

355
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,684
them I'm bringing you the finest

356
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:48,053
farmers France has to offer.

357
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,788
Right and he might have told

358
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:51,389
these Frenchmen they're going to

359
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,691
give you free property.

360
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,092
You don't have to do anything.

361
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,927
You'll live like kings.

362
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,697
Just reach up in the trees
and fruit and gold bars are

363
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:06,698
dropping.

364
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:13,278
In fact, they were thrown
out and say here you are.

365
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:13,713
That's your land.

366
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:21,714
Go ahead.

367
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,493
These four French guys show up.

368
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:28,961
Right.

369
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:32,564
Lopez senior and the
government kept their side of

370
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:33,232
the bargain.

371
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:36,067
They provided them with
houses, equipment.

372
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:41,773
Tours and animals
and everything.

373
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,308
Needs to have one of these.

374
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,343
Pressed sandwiches I think.

375
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,913
And that's it.

376
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:48,414
Dig, grow.

377
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:51,449
The settlers quickly discovered
that farming is hard

378
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,685
work and that the conditions in

379
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:59,424
no way resembled the new
France of their dreams.

380
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:02,127
That's a big snake.

381
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:08,533
So they get broke and they
decide to leave the colony.

382
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:09,801
How many French were left at

383
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:13,939
the end of the new
Bordeaux experiment?

384
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,273
Did any stay?

385
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:22,274
Some of them but few.

386
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,616
Any chance he ended his life

387
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:26,718
here ending the unclaimed escape

388
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,787
and what was prime cattle

389
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:31,758
country turns quickly to dust.

390
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:16,434
So, you have some
information perhaps of the

391
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:22,073
elusive John Bourdain I hear?

392
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,175
I don't know what he did here.

393
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:28,179
Of course I'm hoping for
something extremely glamorous.

394
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,349
A gun runner, drug smuggler.

395
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,418
Maybe he died in the saddle.

396
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,453
Maybe he died happy.

397
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,888
Maybe he was living out in the

398
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:41,226
bush surrounded by adoring
indigenous women.

399
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:41,728
I don't know.

400
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:48,566
You know if he was a masseur for

401
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:52,203
madam lynch I guess I
would be let down.

402
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,907
I had contact with another

403
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,709
historian around the world and

404
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,378
the history of your family
is very interesting.

405
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,880
Oh, really?

406
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:02,782
Okay.

407
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:03,649
Interesting.

408
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:11,650
Yeah, your family, your
grandfather John Bourdain came

409
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:13,392
following the sun.

410
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:17,128
Okay the facts as I know them
so far I think are this.

411
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:22,768
My great, great, granddad, John,

412
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:26,738
his son came to live
with his uncle.

413
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,139
1850 John Bourdain moves.

414
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,910
This is the document that we
have showing him arriving.

415
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:32,644
There he is.

416
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:40,418
In that time, he worked
with... with a hat maker.

417
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,519
A hat maker?

418
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,956
I'm pretty sure he said hat
maker which have to say

419
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:49,594
disappoints me like a lot.

420
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,696
The whole elusive wing of south

421
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,664
American Bourdains were project

422
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,633
runway contestants of their day?

423
00:28:55,634 --> 00:29:00,872
In 1855 Lopez's son arrives.

424
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:03,308
With madam lynch.

425
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:09,614
Madame lynch was fond of
things like French couture.

426
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,017
Yes and that changed
the way of dress.

427
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:14,185
She might have been
good for business.

428
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:17,856
I'm trying to put this in a
light I can be enthusiastic

429
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:18,290
about.

430
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:21,726
Like how clearly forward
thinking they were.

431
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,128
His customers were a hat maker.

432
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:26,898
The people that treated her
with such utter contempt.

433
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:30,235
Did they live in the
colonial homes?

434
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:32,838
In that type of residence?

435
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,305
Yes.

436
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:36,741
Times were changing in south
America too in those days.

437
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:40,078
Society ladies craved the
latest French fashion.

438
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,379
There was money to be made.

439
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:49,380
I'm bummed.

440
00:29:53,392 --> 00:30:01,392
He would have died in 1858.

441
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:02,935
Or before.

442
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:05,871
It was a good way to die

443
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:07,338
because he wouldn't have
to join this horrible war.

444
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,007
He missed the war?

445
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:10,876
Yeah.

446
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,443
The old Lopez died.

447
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,712
The young Lopez got in power.

448
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,347
Our man becomes president.

449
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,250
Yes, Francisco Lopez.

450
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:27,251
Absolutely the most
megomaniacal dictator.

451
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,261
You're right.

452
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:31,963
He was unkind to his siblings.

453
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,264
His brothers were tortured

454
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,533
and killed and the
sisters were jailed.

455
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:36,068
Taken into tiger cages.

456
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:39,237
Tiger cages.

457
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:47,238
Tiger cages and the mother
was given some beating.

458
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:51,082
The 60 something-year-old

459
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,717
mother was flogged and
beaten in front of him.

460
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:53,652
Not a nice man.

461
00:30:53,653 --> 00:30:55,153
He believed that he had a

462
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:57,722
chance to get married with the

463
00:30:57,723 --> 00:31:00,125
daughter of the
emperor of Brazil.

464
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:00,559
That's right.

465
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,229
He was refused on very
unflattering terms.

466
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:09,567
Thanks presumably to his
expansionist ambitions he

467
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,769
dragged Paraguay into the
triple alliance war.

468
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,572
He essentially challenged
all three neighbors.

469
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:18,343
Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.

470
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:19,078
To war.

471
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,812
This doesn't seem
like a good idea.

472
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,781
In what would become the

473
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,483
bloodiest war in Latin America's

474
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,586
history, hundreds
of thousands died.

475
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,922
When Lopez ran out of adults he

476
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,023
sent children into the field

477
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,325
dressed only in rags, armed with

478
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:37,328
sticks, painted to
look like guns.

479
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:44,769
My great grandfather was a
10-year-old boy and he was

480
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,038
dressed alike because otherwise

481
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:55,039
he was going to be
enrolled into the army.

482
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,517
Madam lynch survived.

483
00:31:59,518 --> 00:31:59,885
Yes.

484
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:01,686
But with her money she was

485
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:02,654
allowed to keep her possessions?

486
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,523
Yes.

487
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,392
In history it's hard to find

488
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:11,296
a more disastrous or more cruel

489
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:15,300
or pointless campaign
it would seem.

490
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:17,002
When all was said and done as

491
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:19,237
much as 60% of the population

492
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:27,238
and 90% of the men of
this country were dead.

493
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:43,521
The survivors were just
like 50 or 40,000 people.

494
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,215
There was nothing here
for like 100 years.

495
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,191
John Bourdain dies here?

496
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:14,026
Yes.

497
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:19,430
An adult natural of France by

498
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,932
the name of John Bourdain.

499
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:22,768
Cause of death.

500
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,202
Not specified here.

501
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,071
Is there a grave site?

502
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:26,472
We're looking.

503
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:31,077
We are looking for it.

504
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,751
So I'm hungry.

505
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,453
I'm really hungry.

506
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:18,489
You know you want it.

507
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:18,757
It's late.

508
00:34:18,758 --> 00:34:19,990
You had a few.

509
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,759
No, you had a lot.

510
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,764
You want something greasy,
savory, juicy and nasty.

511
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,766
This is it.

512
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:29,535
Right.

513
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:37,536
That's what today's people
eat in the streets.

514
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:44,715
An egg a little runny please.

515
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:48,386
Soy sauce I think too.

516
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:52,623
Like the ruins of ancient Troy,

517
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:54,559
egg on top of cheese
on top of meat.

518
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:02,560
Now get in my stomach now.

519
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:11,309
Awesome.

520
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,877
Really awesome.

521
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:15,480
And the last thing I give a

522
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:18,249
steaming loaf about anymore,
I mean, I am over it.

523
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,418
Here comes news of the
big break through.

524
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:21,986
I talked with the historian

525
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:25,490
and he says it looks like your

526
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,692
great grandfather what he was

527
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,327
merchandising it was
definitely not hats.

528
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:33,331
Really?

529
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,666
We have here Bourdain.

530
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,001
Right.

531
00:35:36,002 --> 00:35:42,340
And what is he bringing?

532
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,341
Like fire crackers?

533
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,244
There is not even more than

534
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:49,580
200 or 300 wealthy families who

535
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:54,185
sometimes in a birthday
would crack a little bit.

536
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:57,288
Are you suggesting
something untoward?

537
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,190
Weapons.

538
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:02,693
Weapons?

539
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:02,961
Yeah.

540
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:04,629
Awesome.

541
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,198
My aunt always said
he was a gun runner.

542
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,902
We figured she was full of shit.

543
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,371
She also said she was in the

544
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:16,374
resistance, but everybody
in France said that.

545
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,476
So, arms.

546
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:22,146
Was he a hat-maker slash arms...

547
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:26,284
Are all these historians and
gene uses on the money?
