1
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:38,505
What are our expectations?

2
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:46,506
Which of the things we
desire are within reach?

3
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:51,984
If not now, when?

4
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:59,985
And will there be
some left for me?

5
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:09,869
♪ I took a walk through
this beautiful world ♪

6
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:17,644
♪ felt the cool rain
on my shoulder ♪

7
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,780
♪ found something good in
this beautiful world ♪

8
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:27,019
♪ I felt the rain
getting colder ♪

9
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,657
♪ sha la la la la

10
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:33,793
♪ sha la la la la la

11
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,362
♪ sha la la la la

12
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:43,363
♪ sha la la la la la la

13
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:55,848
China's younger generation
is driving a growth

14
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:00,253
in consumption.

15
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:04,991
This is where the real power is.

16
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:08,828
China.

17
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,763
If you live in Manhattan like

18
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:11,998
I do and you think you live in

19
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,000
the center of the world, this

20
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,702
place, Shanghai, will confront

21
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:19,239
you with a very
different reality.

22
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,843
Turn down a side street,
it's an ancient culture.

23
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,279
Centuries old mix of culinary

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,882
traditions, smells, flavors,
a block away, this.

25
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,084
An ultramodern ever clanging

26
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,054
cash register, levels of wealth,

27
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,723
luxury, sheer volume of things

28
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,892
and services unimagined by the

29
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,763
greediest, most of
capitalist imperialists.

30
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,899
The city is split by the river,

31
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,035
a tributary of the yank sea in

32
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:53,906
the oldest section which
features the newer built up

33
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,141
section.

34
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:55,942
The one thing I know for sure

35
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,578
about China is I will
never know China.

36
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,815
It's too big, too old,
too diverse, too deep.

37
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:07,820
There's simply not enough time.

38
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,290
That's for me, the joy of China.

39
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,960
Facing a learning curve
that impossibly steep.

40
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,428
The certain knowledge that even

41
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,430
if I dedicated my life to

42
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,667
learning about China, I'd
die mostly ignorant.

43
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,902
That's exciting.

44
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:23,571
It's too much.

45
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:27,740
And it's changing.

46
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:28,908
So fast.

47
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,245
China has a population of around

48
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,446
$1.3 billion people, and the

49
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,914
number of them who are joining

50
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:38,585
an explosive middle class
demanding their share of all

51
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,320
that good stuff, infrastructure,

52
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,689
the clothes, the cars, the gas,

53
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,624
the fuel, is well, it's the

54
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:52,625
engine that might well
drive the whole world.

55
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,340
Very much, yes.

56
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,674
Okay, what do you want?

57
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:07,213
Order, of course,
some good dumplings.

58
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,815
The professor is an economist

59
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:12,151
and the current Dean of the
college of economics and

60
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:17,156
management that
Shanghai university.

61
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,158
Like so many people you meet

62
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:22,395
here, he's Chinese, but
was educated in American

63
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,063
universities and taught at Yale,

64
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,467
Duke, and Arizona state.

65
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,302
Forgive me, economics are not my

66
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:32,305
area of expertise, I wallow in

67
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,373
ignorance, but China looks

68
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,207
different every time I come.

69
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:40,580
It's changing so, so, so
quickly, how did that happen?

70
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:44,050
China, enjoyed this long
period of peace, no serious

71
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:44,552
enemy.

72
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:45,152
No major wars.

73
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:45,686
Right.

74
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:51,491
So the manufacturing
industry really took off.

75
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:54,894
Internally, formed
an open door policy.

76
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,829
Every country willing
to trade with China.

77
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,331
There's certainly no doubt

78
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:03,169
that at this point, we are, our

79
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,004
destinies are inextricably bound

80
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,273
up, our economies are hope

81
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,675
legislationly interming med, if

82
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,910
one fails, the effect
would be disastrous.

83
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,712
Global impact.

84
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,447
We are, to say the least.

85
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:21,253
It's certainly... beautiful.

86
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,757
This is what I was waiting for.

87
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,926
Literally small
steaming basket buns.

88
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,695
But I translate them in my head

89
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,797
to pillows of happiness that

90
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,766
will scald your tongue and

91
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:38,237
throat if you don't
know what you're doing.

92
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:39,972
Look, there are a lot of reasons

93
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,774
to come to China and Shanghai in

94
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,376
particular, but these babies,

95
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:48,280
done right, these things
alone are worth the trip.

96
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,217
Ground pork and shrimp, folded

97
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,219
exactly and always 20 times

98
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,058
inside freshly made
individually rolled out dough.

99
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,727
As their steamed a delicious,

100
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,962
delicious fat renders into the

101
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,631
soup of the gods, which then if

102
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:10,102
you're not careful, causes
unforgettable damage as it

103
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,740
changes your life forever.

104
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:14,675
So good.

105
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:17,610
In the China of the future,

106
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,946
places like this will be even

107
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:23,015
more packed by Chinese, by

108
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,183
expats, by visitors looking for

109
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,619
the deeply satisfying rush of

110
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,987
screamingly hot goodness.

111
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:31,491
The chewy, deeply savory,

112
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,125
fragrant, perfectly shaped and

113
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,595
folded ballistically designed

114
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:38,498
vehicles for pure pleasure.

115
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:41,100
And the allure of Shanghai's

116
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,504
style pork chop, served with the

117
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:52,505
local take on Worcestershire sauce.

118
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,315
It's unbelievable.

119
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,116
I really believe the word is

120
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:01,287
con verget, and China will again

121
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,722
be privatizing more and more,

122
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,525
but the difficulty, nowadays,

123
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:08,294
it's just, the technology is so

124
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:11,030
advanced, we don't really meet

125
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,364
that many people to do things

126
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,534
that many people used to do.

127
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:19,806
In which the population, seven

128
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,173
billion people, probably doesn't

129
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,809
need that many people
working anymore.

130
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,477
Right.

131
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:27,914
So the question is, what
should human beings do?

132
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,582
You know.

133
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,184
How can you let them not doing

134
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,488
anything, and they're
still living a good life?

135
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,490
Right.

136
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,225
I don't know.

137
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:41,260
It's going to be a big issue

138
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:46,032
that can face the whole world.

139
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,835
What is the future?

140
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:49,169
I don't know.

141
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,003
But to a very great extent, it

142
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,272
is surely being determined here.

143
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,842
Is there a plan?

144
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:56,510
Probably not.

145
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:59,345
Only appetites.

146
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,213
And increasingly, the means to

147
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,415
fulfill those appetites.

148
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,752
Those dreams and aspirations.

149
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,687
Who will drive the car that

150
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,222
takes us to wherever
we are going?

151
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,391
They will be young,
whoever they are.

152
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:18,598
And not unlike yow, a
30-year-old Shanghai native

153
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,366
ejtsed in the USA, current lay

154
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,803
feature's reporter for
the Shanghai daily.

155
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:26,873
She may be the picture of modern

156
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:31,010
China, but this is her
favorite restaurant.

157
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,612
China and Shanghai in particular

158
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,881
might be transforming fast, but

159
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:40,219
this place stays
resolutely the same.

160
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,557
She runs the place, serving
classic, home style food.

161
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:47,493
There's no menu,
no waiting list.

162
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,462
And you only get a
seat if she likes you.

163
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,466
I ordered too much, sorry.

164
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,768
Fantastic.

165
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,503
Very happy.

166
00:08:56,504 --> 00:09:00,439
We're joined by her friend,

167
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,145
Lu an artist, and
Matthew, a restauranteur.

168
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,914
How do you eat these?

169
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:08,115
Whole.

170
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:10,683
I eat them whole because
I really like this.

171
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,018
That works.

172
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,253
Oh, they're good.

173
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:18,825
I think they cook a few seconds.

174
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,860
They are tiny little shrimp,

175
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,329
deep fried first and quicklies

176
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,701
toed in the wok with garlic,
ginger, salt, and soy.

177
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,170
What is classic Shanghai food?

178
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,172
What's distinctive about it?

179
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:37,276
Well this frinz, it's often...

180
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,779
Friends, it's... for instance,

181
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,447
it's often black, and dark.

182
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:45,685
It has been for some time
a city of immigrants.

183
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,788
The food reflects
that genealogy.

184
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:53,860
A combination of people from the

185
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,795
province known for soy and

186
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:56,963
vinegar, and others known for

187
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,064
fresh ingredients and attention

188
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:01,400
to preserving the
aliveness of its dishes.

189
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,236
It's the best of both worlds.

190
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:08,474
Great sauces, great ingredients.

191
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,643
There's braised pork belly in a

192
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,478
deep red glaze of dark and light

193
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:18,017
soy sauce, cinnamon,
sugar, and annise.

194
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,419
A small fish poached first in

195
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,488
rice wine, salt and light soy,

196
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,357
then fried in ginger garlic oil,

197
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,427
more soy and sugar until it's

198
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,330
reduced into a
gorgeous sticky sauce.

199
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:35,835
Duck that's been marinated,
blanched, then reheated,

200
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,336
smothered in a sauce made from

201
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,738
the reduced drippings left in

202
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:42,341
the wok with dark
soy, salt, and sugar.

203
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,044
And this to round things out, a

204
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,279
Clay pot soup of bean curd based

205
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,448
stock with salted pork belly,

206
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,685
tofu ribbons, and bamboo chutes.

207
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,956
Oh good flavor.

208
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:00,459
This is a socialist
country, supposedly.

209
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,528
Yep.

210
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,397
But it's a communist
country, supposedly.

211
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,465
It is in fact from evidence that

212
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,235
I've seen, the most dynamic

213
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:12,271
capitalist country on earth.

214
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,539
What do you think about that?

215
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,808
I think a lot of my western

216
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,779
friends come here thinking China

217
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,382
is a version of North Korea or

218
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,550
the party controls everything,

219
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,652
but they come here, they are

220
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,654
surprised, it's
actually not that much.

221
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:31,657
They do seem to be promoting the

222
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:36,996
free market even more with
the free trade zone, just

223
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:37,898
established in Shanghai.

224
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,065
It's amazing.

225
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:42,001
From what I see, everywhere

226
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,335
we go, more Chinese, Chinese

227
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,636
influence, Chinese food, if you

228
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,439
build a casino in Vegas or a

229
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,675
hotel in Singapore, you have to

230
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,143
consider what will the Chinese

231
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,344
think, is that exciting?

232
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:59,451
It's exciting that we finally

233
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,821
have a thing that we wouldn't.

234
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:04,256
China is sort of in a spotlight

235
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,192
in the central, we wouldn't have

236
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,660
dreamed of, like say
only a decade ago.

237
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,697
For me, I think, you know,

238
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,766
the communist menace that we

239
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,268
always used to talk about in
America, I think the most

240
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,703
terrifying scenario is that

241
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:25,444
China becomes a completely
free market, non-socialist,

242
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:29,449
non-communist society
because you'd bury us.

243
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:41,127
I love few things more than
quoting that impeccable

244
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:46,532
communist Deng Sho Peng
to be rich is glorious.

245
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,200
All isms are Wasims.

246
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:51,370
Dig deep, and it's
always about the money.

247
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,671
Meet Tim Si.

248
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,206
Resident of communist China, man

249
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,675
of impeccable taste, one of more

250
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:00,379
than 150,000 Shanghainese

251
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,048
millionaires accustomed
to the good life.

252
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:06,052
Take the sea water out,
we place with champagne.

253
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,253
Have it only once.

254
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,221
Hopefully you like it.

255
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,721
He likes nice things.

256
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,359
And he makes Donald Trump's

257
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,694
ticky tacky empire look like the

258
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,264
back of Pauly D.'S Van.

259
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,366
Where are these from?

260
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,234
They're great.

261
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:21,568
France.

262
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,069
France, fantastic.

263
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,570
Good shape.

264
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:24,904
I keep them happy.

265
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,239
Every single one is flown from

266
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,008
jet so they're nice
and happy and safe.

267
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,711
Apparently.

268
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,713
Tim is an investor into real

269
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,416
estate, telecoms, and the newly

270
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,886
expanding service industries
of the new China.

271
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,720
He's also the president of

272
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,690
Roosevelt China investments, a

273
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,292
very old company with a long

274
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,259
history doing business here.

275
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,560
Created by the Roosevelt family,

276
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,030
maybe you've heard of them.

277
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,765
This is his clubhouse, really,

278
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:58,537
the house of Roosevelt right
in the middle of it all.

279
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,606
Wine is big here now.

280
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,941
The French chateaus more and

281
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,043
more they look to China as the

282
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,946
indicators of price
as the market maker.

283
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:10,716
Tim alone has stocked
around 4,000 labels here.

284
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,418
China in general bought two

285
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,954
billion bottles of red
wine last year alone.

286
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,388
Think about that for a minute.

287
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,790
They are now the leading market

288
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,294
for red wine in the world.

289
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,297
It's pretty amazing here.

290
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,400
I designed this place
in five minutes.

291
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:33,405
I look at this place like
six months... uh-huh.

292
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,641
Daytime, nighttime, and

293
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:38,144
finally one morning, I said, I'm

294
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,947
going to make a wine
cellar out of this.

295
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,781
It looks so good.

296
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:43,283
Thank you.

297
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:44,350
This is nice.

298
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:44,851
Hi.

299
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:50,589
Tim invited me to dinner
alongside of people who have

300
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,994
taken full advantage of
the booming economy.

301
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,628
Daniel, a real estate developer,

302
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:01,367
and cocoa, a party planner.

303
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,602
You eat like this all the time?

304
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,603
Nice wine cellar.

305
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:08,507
Twice a night.

306
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:14,646
Today we're surrounded by
Southern French wine, and

307
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,215
Italian wine.

308
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:19,885
And if you like it, you can

309
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,954
drink from wine
country every night.

310
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,823
Isn't this supposed to
be communist China?

311
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:29,295
I mean, it seems like... can
I ask one question, any

312
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:34,633
one of the communist party
comrades party member?

313
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,635
No.

314
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,071
I'm a bit of a red diaper baby.

315
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,073
What I mean to say, it just

316
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:45,044
seems that the realm of the
possible here is very big.

317
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,379
Absolutely.

318
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,514
It's a big stage.

319
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,716
I mean, in New York City, you

320
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,986
can see that, and why
a massive party.

321
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:57,723
That's probably the only
one in the whole city.

322
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,058
There's tenth massive parties

323
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,727
going on, and there's ten more

324
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,695
coming up in the next
couple of years.

325
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,699
It's a big city, but small
village at the end.

326
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,703
And I think food is the best

327
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,006
weapons on earth to make peace.

328
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,774
It's the food.

329
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:16,842
It's the drink.

330
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,578
We have better peace on earth.

331
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,948
And you probably the
united nation ambassador.

332
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:30,089
In time.

333
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:34,226
From south pole.

334
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,595
Only New Zealand has found them.

335
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,930
Try it, wasabi if you'd like.

336
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,400
A lot of Chinese
restaurant in New York...

337
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,270
I grew up in the 50s and 60s,

338
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:47,306
even then, Chinese restaurant,

339
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,708
Chinese food was really an

340
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,909
essential part of
being a new yorker.

341
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,213
I mean if you don't know
thousand use chop sticks as a

342
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:58,884
new yorker, you were a
terrible new yorker.

343
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,952
I'll ask one thing, you know

344
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,922
how to speak like a
Brooklyn person?

345
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,125
It's a tough accent.

346
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:10,562
Queens is easier, it's more of

347
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,299
a, I can't, I mean, I live right

348
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,267
next to it my whole life.

349
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,002
We don't want to hear it.

350
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,939
I just to want hear
not for nothing.

351
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,108
What?

352
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,177
Not for nothing.

353
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:25,645
That's Brooklyn.

354
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:27,779
Not for nothing.

355
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,783
Not for nothing, but I could
use a little more wine.

356
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:32,051
There.

357
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,453
Not for nothing.

358
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,155
Nothing, nothing.

359
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,422
Not for nothing.

360
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,825
Not for nothing.

361
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:44,496
All right.

362
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,797
Shanghai chef prepares a meal

363
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,667
of a style that will become

364
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:49,436
without a doubt more and more

365
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:50,836
typical and in demand here among

366
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:51,937
those who can afford it.

367
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:58,009
And more and more people
every day can afford it.

368
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,512
What is it?

369
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:04,383
We have tomato and
potato, and that's it.

370
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,519
What else do we have?

371
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,956
Australian beef, a massive,

372
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:14,126
perfectly cooked Tom hawk chop,

373
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:18,164
$150 a pound, that
includes bones and fat.

374
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,632
This is about a thousand
dollars worth of steak.

375
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,169
Even if Tim wanted to serve good

376
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,837
old USA beef, still the finest

377
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,840
on earth in my
opinion, he can't.

378
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,377
China has banned imports over

379
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:32,978
concerns of mad cow disease.

380
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:37,583
While they carve, the quick
trip behind the bookshelf.

381
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,352
Now I want to show
you the best place.

382
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,488
Wow.

383
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:47,426
So you name, your label,
the village of wines.

384
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:51,663
There's a chance we have it.

385
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:55,501
And so this size is our
interesting wine that they can

386
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,269
keep ageing themselves.

387
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,171
This is the house collection.

388
00:18:59,172 --> 00:18:59,839
That's correct.

389
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,240
Right.

390
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:03,242
And I want to show you
the membership area.

391
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:07,045
The newest member,
Anthony Bourdain.

392
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:07,747
Me?

393
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,916
And it's all our collection

394
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:15,354
of wriens, please, open it.

395
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:15,522
Ah.

396
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:18,424
Well, cool.

397
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:23,862
It's good being
the... thank you.

398
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:24,564
Thank you so much.

399
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:25,931
Close that up, man.

400
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,601
Close it up.

401
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,651
Here's the thing, even with

402
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,118
the modern China rising out of

403
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,587
the ground all around you, even

404
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,623
with all the things the same
things you see for sale

405
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,492
everywhere where people have

406
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:55,927
money these days, even with all

407
00:19:55,928 --> 00:20:00,766
that, there's still this China.

408
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,402
Shoning road, just south
of people's square.

409
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,637
It's still happening.

410
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:09,107
The good old stuff.

411
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:12,478
The China you first
fell in love with.

412
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,580
Walk down the street and look in

413
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,749
any direction, and there's
something to eat.

414
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,685
I may not know what it is

415
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:24,290
immediately, but chances
are, it's good.

416
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,926
We talk about foodies and
what does that mean?

417
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,428
By current definition, best I

418
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:34,333
can understand it, that makes

419
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:34,967
just about every Chinese person

420
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:35,968
I ever laid eyes on a foodie.

421
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,503
Which is to say a perfectly

422
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,771
reasonable person who enjoys and

423
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:44,142
pays attention to where
the good stuff is.

424
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,210
Look at this.

425
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:49,348
One street, and look, stuffed

426
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,850
oysters grilled over charcoal.

427
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,552
Snake bits, why yes.

428
00:20:53,553 --> 00:21:01,553
And yes, it does taste
kind of like chicken.

429
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,531
There used to be a lot of
streets like this full of it

430
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:07,032
where you could look, shop

431
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:11,670
around, then eat all
out in the open.

432
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:12,738
Happy, delicious torrent of

433
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,806
food, but the government, as

434
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,477
governments do, are
tightening the screws.

435
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:24,550
Old is bad, new is good.

436
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:31,823
Not everybody thinks this
is a good idea though.

437
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:36,227
Bill Wang was born in Shanghai
and studied here at the

438
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:36,563
university.

439
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:38,229
He began teaching English before

440
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,765
he was out of college.

441
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:43,369
He suggested we meet, and there

442
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,571
may be stalls all over Shanghai,

443
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:51,510
but bill says this one,
this one is the one.

444
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,412
So you're an English teacher?

445
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,746
Yes, yes.

446
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,182
Most of the people I meet of

447
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,284
Chinese background who speak

448
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:07,092
English have, their teachers
were British, sometimes

449
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,860
Australian, or New Zealand.

450
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,228
Younger generation, there's more

451
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,563
of that sort of TV accent.

452
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:13,632
Is that good or bad?

453
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,601
I think it's good.

454
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:18,036
You know, TV series, especially

455
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:21,940
American TV series are
so popular in China.

456
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,242
What are the most popular?

457
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,244
Right now, house of cards.

458
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,379
House of cards.

459
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,047
Yeah.

460
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,081
So popular.

461
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,149
House of card.

462
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,118
That's really interesting, what

463
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,453
do you think the appeal is here?

464
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:39,591
You know, in the show,
American, they talk about

465
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,726
president, in China there's no

466
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:43,094
way you can talk about
those sensitive topics.

467
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,430
So many people love that show,

468
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:45,431
it's really, really good.

469
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:50,101
Wow, that's really
a surprise to me.

470
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:50,269
Wow.

471
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:50,603
This is huge.

472
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:56,508
Yes.

473
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,477
Yeah.

474
00:22:58,478 --> 00:22:59,145
Yum, good.

475
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,412
Is it good?

476
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:08,319
Uh-huh.

477
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,191
Minced pork, ginger, moistened
with rice wine, soy,

478
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:17,529
it all gets mixed up nicely
and folded into the dough.

479
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,998
Boiled until just right and

480
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,333
sauced with soy sauce, vinegar,

481
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,170
sesame oil, and peanut butter.

482
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,372
You have a sweet, savory thing

483
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,476
going on with every bite.

484
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:31,043
You want this.

485
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:34,613
Believe me, you want this bad.

486
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:38,149
In fact, you need it.

487
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,651
What do your students want to do

488
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:42,454
when they enter the
professional field?

489
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:42,989
What's the dream?

490
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,357
I think this generation,
there are a lot of them are

491
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:46,559
lost.

492
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,859
They don't know what to do.

493
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,729
If you ask like the university,
what is the dream?

494
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,364
Right.

495
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,634
Buy an apartment in Shanghai,

496
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:58,403
buy a car, you know,
that kinds of things.

497
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,472
Are there enough
jobs for everybody?

498
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,641
It's becoming more and
more competitive.

499
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:03,042
Right.

500
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:05,243
Everybody wants the best job,

501
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,045
so many very few
of them out there.

502
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,080
But I think there's like a huge

503
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,216
gap between company
and new graduates.

504
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:11,584
Right.

505
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:14,720
Company wants
experienced workers.

506
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:15,254
Right.

507
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:17,055
New graduates also
want a good job.

508
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:17,690
Now.

509
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,591
Yeah, now.

510
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:19,758
They are not ready for it.

511
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,560
Right.

512
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:23,161
They don't want to do some,

513
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:26,331
you know, hard work,
start from scratch.

514
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:26,599
Right.

515
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,534
So that's the problem.

516
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:29,568
It looks to me, China in

517
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:30,902
general, Shanghai in particular,

518
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,270
is changing very, very fast.

519
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,404
Very, very fast.

520
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,173
Every time I come,
it's different.

521
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,742
And in your recent memory, in

522
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,443
the last ten years, what's the

523
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,579
most noticeable change to you?

524
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,548
Food like this.

525
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:45,851
It's becoming more and
more difficult to find.

526
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:48,587
This is handmade.

527
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:49,921
And I think this is real food.

528
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,090
It's not very expensive, and it

529
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,059
tastes great, but a lot of food,

530
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,728
you know, processed
food right now.

531
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:59,464
And also, of course Internet.

532
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,432
It has pros and cons, the good

533
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,603
part is that you can get
information easily.

534
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:05,271
Right.

535
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:06,605
That part is people don't

536
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,273
talk to each other, that's bad.

537
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:10,075
People go to a restaurant, you

538
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,377
know, like a couple, they take

539
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,745
pictures, and use their cell

540
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,581
phone, they don't
talk to each other.

541
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:18,083
They're communicating with
everybody else in the world

542
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,284
except who's at the table.

543
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,252
What's the point.

544
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:23,622
It didn't happen until
you tweeted, as we say.

545
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:26,726
Oh my gosh.

546
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:44,910
What's clear very quickly
here is the way China claims

547
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,845
things are the way they're

548
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:50,148
supposed to be, and the way they

549
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:54,920
actually are, two
different things.

550
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,422
Meet Thomas you.

551
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,625
Hacker turned entrepreneur.

552
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:01,793
He recently received significant

553
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,361
startup money to build what he

554
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:07,132
calls an open source
project sharing platform.

555
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:11,670
To connect Chinese college
students with the world.

556
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:15,006
When you say hacking, what is,

557
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,108
what do you do when you hack?

558
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,477
What's the intent?

559
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:22,513
Actually, it starts from MIT.

560
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,717
If you go to the computer
science and artificial

561
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,153
intelligence building, MIT, it

562
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,521
will show you the
definition of hack.

563
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,859
It's actually a very positive

564
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,027
word that's been in
a negative word.

565
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:40,398
One hacker is people who are
really, they really like

566
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,368
programming, and they love
to share information.

567
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,569
Just like cooking.

568
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,875
You love to share recipes to
other friend for a lot of

569
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:50,209
cooking.

570
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,344
Legally, there might be
something wrong with it, but

571
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,345
morally do you think there's

572
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,515
anything wrong with you're

573
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,050
essentially breaking into
an information base.

574
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,551
I'm not doing any damage, I'm

575
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,053
going to look around, see how

576
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,822
things work, and I'll leave

577
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,090
without disturbing anything.

578
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:07,492
Would most hackers say
that that's okay?

579
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:08,727
Yes.

580
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:09,061
Yes.

581
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:11,429
It's in the service
of knowledge.

582
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:17,736
It's okay for most of the
hackers in our communities.

583
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,537
I was lucky, I got into a big

584
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,239
hacker community here in shank

585
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,241
lie and met great mentors.

586
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,210
Started in business in 21.

587
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:28,246
I did.

588
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,580
Great accomplishment.

589
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,949
You didn't go to college?

590
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,450
I didn't.

591
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:36,521
Why not?

592
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:39,224
The country is so advanced in

593
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:42,260
so many other ways,
why in this area?

594
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:45,096
Network problem here in

595
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:48,800
China, we have GFW, it blocks a

596
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:51,737
lot of important
information websites.

597
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:58,609
And a lot of people, we can't
use in college at all.

598
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,913
And so the human resource
problem and power problem is

599
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:04,049
getting more and more
serious here in China.

600
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,585
Because everyone's going
to silicon valley?

601
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,555
They offer better, obviously.

602
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:12,257
These are the famous ribs?

603
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:12,792
Yes.

604
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:13,992
Maybe the number one thing

605
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,626
that the seriously food crazed

606
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,828
traveler coming back from

607
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,664
Shanghai will tell you to eat,

608
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:27,665
other than the soup
dumplings of course, ribs.

609
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,990
It takes two cooks working
at once to make this dish.

610
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:48,827
One deep fries the ribs in
hot oil until just right.

611
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,929
Another toasts the ginger,

612
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,299
cumin, and other
spices in a wok.

613
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,703
And then, in go the ribs.

614
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,471
And if you're devoted of what's

615
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,675
called wok, you sit as close as

616
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:08,446
possible to capture that
elusive, fast dissipating

617
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:12,083
breath, flavor of
the wok itself.

618
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,952
Toss them around coating those

619
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:17,355
bones with all that
good stuff, then serve.

620
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:20,358
And because we like it to burn,

621
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:26,697
Thomas orders some
spicy chicken dish.

622
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,533
Hey means energy, light force,

623
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:32,470
or breath, and that's what
you're looking for of the

624
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:36,241
flavor, the essence of a very

625
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:44,242
old, carefully seasoned
cooking vessel.

626
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:58,396
Oddly enough, Thomas tells me

627
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:02,267
there's no mandarin or at least

628
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:04,335
Shanghainese work for wok, it's

629
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,536
simply called a cooking pot.

630
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,438
To which I say I really do know

631
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:11,742
nothing about this country.

632
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:12,278
Fantastic.

633
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,913
Wow.

634
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:15,114
Yeah.

635
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,115
I love that.

636
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:18,917
Not too good.

637
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:19,718
Not bad.

638
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:22,753
To me, and I've eat an lot of

639
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:29,194
food, this is spicy,
fresh, bright, vibrant...

640
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,628
I will take you
somewhere better.

641
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,964
So are you a foodie?

642
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,766
Yeah, I eat a lot.

643
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,803
Were you born here, in Shanghai?

644
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:39,438
Yeah.

645
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:41,272
At least in modern times,

646
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,473
it's hard to imagine that any

647
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,642
place has changed as profoundly

648
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:49,780
and changing as quickly
as it is changing here.

649
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,816
We feel very proud.

650
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,819
We really feel proud.

651
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,922
Our qualities of life is

652
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:58,957
improving really, really faster.

653
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,726
In a poll, 85% of Chinese who

654
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,628
were asked the question, do you

655
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:09,935
feel that your life will
be better next year?

656
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:13,338
85% said yes, it will
be better next year.

657
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,240
This is an extraordinary number.

658
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:15,942
Yeah.

659
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:17,475
I don't know a lot of other

660
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:20,778
countries that would say that.

661
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:21,347
Yeah.

662
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:27,452
Well that looks great.

663
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:28,586
Famous chicken.

664
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,155
So good.

665
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:33,124
Not bad.

666
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,193
You know, I'm finding this

667
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:36,761
food really, really delicious.

668
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:43,668
And you're saying it's
just... it's so-so.

669
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,138
Wow.

670
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,015
Shanghai is one of the
biggest cities in the world

671
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,349
right now.

672
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,351
A global financial center and

673
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:04,189
transportation hub and the
world's busiest port.

674
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,791
You can smell the money.

675
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,793
But maybe the real story is the

676
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:12,697
newly emerging participants
in global capitalism.

677
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:13,632
The middle class.

678
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:16,167
The working class.

679
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,169
Who also want flat screen TVs

680
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,305
and cars, and vacations, and the

681
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:24,375
promise of better
for their kids.

682
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,544
Take this couple, typical

683
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:31,749
working class Chinese from
the worker's paradise.

684
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,819
Mei, a bus driver, and
Don, his bride to be.

685
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,854
Today is their wedding day.

686
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,889
And custom must be observed.

687
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,891
When it comes to weddings, the

688
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,327
Chinese have always gone big,

689
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,996
and these days, bigger still.

690
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:49,667
Lots of food, lots of
booze, lots of people.

691
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:50,569
Getting crazy.

692
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,570
Which is why Thomas and I have

693
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:55,006
become wedding crashers.

694
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:58,676
The constellation bar
for a prewedding drink.

695
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:03,248
The classic Chinese
cocktail, the Moscow mule.

696
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:04,249
Okay, maybe not Chinese.

697
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,683
These are good.

698
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:06,285
Yeah.

699
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:09,687
This is the reason why
I love this place.

700
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:10,755
Are you married?

701
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:11,390
No.

702
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:13,024
Not yet.

703
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:16,194
I'm not a big fan of marriage.

704
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:17,862
You've been to weddings, yes?

705
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,264
Yes.

706
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:23,468
Have you ever crashed
a wedding before?

707
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,271
No.

708
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,605
It's going to be a little weird.

709
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:31,809
I mean, we don't
know anybody there.

710
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,945
How do you do?

711
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,783
Well, I hope the food's
good that the thing.

712
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:44,722
You probably have
a lot of drinks.

713
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,756
Could be really crazy.

714
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,458
Oh really?

715
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,159
Yeah.

716
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,293
Uh-oh.

717
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:51,629
Drink a lot.

718
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,099
Really?

719
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,566
So, ready to crash a wedding?

720
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:59,304
Yeah, let's do it.

721
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:07,305
All right.

722
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:15,946
♪

723
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,488
Yeah.

724
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,490
The Chinese wedding
is not cheap.

725
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,359
You need a banquet room, in this

726
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,660
case the families rented out

727
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:28,166
this place at the historic
park hotel Shanghai.

728
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,834
Chinese weddings generally

729
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:31,469
speaking, mean the presence of a

730
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:37,542
number of formalities.

731
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:42,280
First, meet the bride and
groom upon entering.

732
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:44,782
Red envelope, also known as the

733
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,784
hung bow, like in good fellas,

734
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:48,986
it's a little something
