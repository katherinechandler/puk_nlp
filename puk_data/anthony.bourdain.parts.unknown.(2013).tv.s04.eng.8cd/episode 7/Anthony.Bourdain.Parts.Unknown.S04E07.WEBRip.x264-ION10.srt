00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,211
This is where I bought
my first bag of heroin.

2
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,480
It was 1980, I was 24 years old.

3
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,382
But in a lot of ways, my whole

4
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:22,389
life up to that point was
leading to this address.

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,325
Western Massachusetts, the
unlikely new frontier of

6
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,794
America's war on drugs.

7
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,629
Where heroin has become an

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,830
exploding problem that's begun

9
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:36,403

It's majestic.

22
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,194
I love the beach.

23
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:36,829
Pretty much had my first
everything on a beach.

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,500
You name, first time
I did it, beach.

25
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,802
I was miserable in love, happy

26
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:46,706
in love, alternately, as
only a 17-year-old could be.

27
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,641
This is where I lived.

28
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,210
Very happy summer in the early

29
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,845
'70s, and that was
my room on the left.

30
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,849
It's an amazing spot if you
think about it, a bunch of

31
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,519
knuckle heads working as dish

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,988
washers, way or
its, beach servers.

33
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,257
We could work on a
beach like this.

34
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,593
Happier, stupider times.

35
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:09,329
You know, I can still hear the

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,164
play list, the brothers Johnson.

37
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:15,034
If you put on Marvin Gaye right

38
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,838
now, I'd burst into tears.

39
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,207
What do you do?

40
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,873
You're young, you go to the

41
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,843
beach, you get laid,
and you get high.

42
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:28,581
It was here, all the way out
at the tip of Cape Cod,

43
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,049
Provincetown, Massachusetts,

44
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,019
where the pilgrims first landed.

45
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,189
And it was where I first landed.

46
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,258
1972, washed in a town with a

47
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:42,762
headful of orange sunshine
and a few friends.

48
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,130
Provincetown, a wonderland of

49
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,298
tolerance, long time tradition

50
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,133
of accepting artists, writers,

51
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:50,303
the badly behaved, the
gay, the different.

52
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:55,242
It was paradise.

53
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,876
The joy that can only come with

54
00:02:56,877 --> 00:03:00,880
an absolute certainty
that you're invincible.

55
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,315
None of the choices that you

56
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,651
make will have any repercussions

57
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,753
or any effect on
your later life.

58
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,054
We didn't think
about those things.

59
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,722
I don't know what I thought
I was going to be.

60
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,391
At that point, I certainly

61
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:12,892
didn't think I was
going to be a cook.

62
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,827
I don't know what I thought
I was going to be.

63
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,929
I was just, you know, hanging
out in a beautiful place.

64
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,065
A golden time, I look back on

65
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:23,135
those fuzzy memories and
they seem golden anyway.

66
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,904
Oh, there's John waters.

67
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,907
First love, and there's me.

68
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,810
This guy, Johnny was sort of a

69
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:38,084
sinful figure in
all of our lives.

70
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:43,923
Well, my name is John, and
this is spiritist pizza, its

71
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,659
been here since 1971.

72
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,361
This town is everything to me.

73
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,762
Provincetown is a really special

74
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,764
place where people
can be themselves.

75
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,633
We all did drugs, acted young

76
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,035
and crazy, and Tony was, he was

77
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,537
probably a little Wilder than

78
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,372
some and not as wild as others.

79
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,441
But he was always the
guy who I always liked.

80
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:04,711
And you let me sleep on
talk of the walk in.

81
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,813
I remember that.

82
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,448
I cannot tell you how frequently

83
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,450
I freem about the pizza.

84
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,684
I'm walking down commercial

85
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,521
street, and I'm dimly aware that

86
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:15,655
spiritist has moved and there's

87
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,189
a sense of dislocation and a

88
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,626
loss as I stumble around this

89
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:23,463
Provincetown dream
scape of 40 years ago.

90
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:29,068
I was still here and
living in hope.

91
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:29,637
Unbelievable.

92
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:34,206
Many of the old places
in p-town are gone.

93
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,842
But the lobster pot is still

94
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,345
going strong, all
these years later.

95
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:41,213
And still has what
I want and need.

96
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,982
The essentials.

97
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,017
My friends worked in the kitchen

98
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,920
here, starting the tradition

99
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,689
that cooking work
was noble toil.

100
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,158
I never intended a
career as a chef.

101
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,259
It's great to be a cook.

102
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,496
I was getting to that.

103
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:56,830
Yes.

104
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:59,332
This is homemade Portuguese

105
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,434
Kale soup, made on the premises.

106
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,503
Its ban long time, thank you.

107
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,504
Enjoy.

108
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:11,177
Portuguese soup, a P-town
version and just what I

109
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:11,679
remembered.

110
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,547
Kale, kidney beans, potatoes.

111
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:15,848
Oh, I missed you.

112
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,717
I missed you bad.

113
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,452
And that was precisely what I

114
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,953
loved about the food here.

115
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,922
The Portuguese thing, dishes

116
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,392
like this stuffed COD crusted

117
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,360
with sausage, bread crumbs,

118
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,396
stuffed with scallop and crab.

119
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,798
Some Sherry, read sauce.

120
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,967
I hadn't been working for a
while, I was a deadbeat.

121
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,970
Just scarfing for
everybody else.

122
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,407
And he comes from work and says

123
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,909
our dishwasher didn't
show up today.

124
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,744
You are our new dishwasher.

125
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:45,778
And I said really.

126
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,414
And the next day I put on the

127
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,882
apron and didn't take
it off for 30 years.

128
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,919
I'd wake up, all of us go to the

129
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,587
beach, hang out until
like 2:00, 3:00.

130
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,888
Yeah, it was fun.

131
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,490
Roll into work.

132
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,791
Work all night.

133
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:02,562
Drinking, getting high,
drilling out food.

134
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,964
You have all the food you
wanted, all the liquor you

135
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:05,232
wanted?

136
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:06,433
All the sex you wanted.

137
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,900
All the sex you wanted.

138
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,569
It was true, it was fun.

139
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,404
And still an essential
part of the economy.

140
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:15,241
It was a lot of fun,
believe me, I remember.

141
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,009
The flagship, it's where
my cooking career started.

142
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,414
Write started washing dishes,
where I started have

143
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,182
pretensionings of
culinary grandeur.

144
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,653
It was a good gig for anybody?

145
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:30,356
You had to be in a band, here we

146
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:30,924
were, we were dish washers.

147
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,625
Yeah you get older and more

148
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,960
sense and you realize that like,

149
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,596
you know, you got to like
pace yourself a little bit.

150
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,798
Otherwise, we still
wouldn't be here.

151
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,266
Well, you know, many of our

152
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,868
friends from those
days didn't make it.

153
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:48,108
Many of my friends
are dead, yeah.

154
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:53,946
Keep drinking, keep drinking.

155
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:54,214
Thank you.

156
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,347
Thank you, Tony.

157
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,883
This place has
been here forever.

158
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,451
That used to be the back room.

159
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,619
Back room's still there.

160
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,889
See, it's all falling
into place again.

161
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,956
Yeah.

162
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,324
It's not that much different.

163
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,493
It's early spring now, but

164
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:08,227
come Memorial Day, it gets crazy

165
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:12,231
around here, and doesn't
stop until labor day.

166
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:15,234
Provincetown was always
gay-friendly, in my time and

167
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,669
way, way before my time.

168
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,671
And this place, the Atlantic

169
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,906
house known always and forever

170
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,208
by locals and visitors alike as

171
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:26,212
the a house as America's
oldest operating gay bar.

172
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:29,749
Everybody has come through
these doors, so to speak.

173
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:37,750
Most notably, naked and
frolicy Tennessee Williams.

174
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:38,191
No.

175
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:38,559
That's too bad.

176
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,395
Everybody got seasick.

177
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,365
They all save cocktails so I
can get my sea legs back.

178
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,167
Oh really?

179
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,101
Yeah.

180
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:50,036
April owns the joint now.

181
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:55,341
Taken over for her father,
the legendary Reggie, a

182
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,943
forward-thinking dude
if there ever was one.

183
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,679
It was built in 1798.

184
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,713
How long in the family?

185
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,348
Over 75 years.

186
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,783
My father during that time, he

187
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,352
had Billy holiday appeared, he

188
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:10,757
had Cy Moan, El Fanlts,
all the big names, jazz.

189
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:12,024
How has town changed?

190
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:12,893
Has it changed?

191
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:14,193
I think tremendously.

192
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,696
Gay lifestyle is
much more accepted.

193
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:21,267
Okay, 1972, my feeling was
that this was a gay town and

194
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:24,303
that I was here at the pleasure

195
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,572
of, you know, somebody else.

196
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,273
Which is sort of the opposite of

197
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,808
everywhere outside of
here at that time.

198
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:29,909
Oh yes.

199
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:35,114
This was largely catholic,
Portuguese, conservative

200
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,617
community, but it was
also known as hell town.

201
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,219
Hell town, there's where the

202
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,823
pure tins sent their rejects.

203
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:44,957
Yeah.

204
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,594
Provincetown had the mixture

205
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,395
really of the bohemian people

206
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:53,566
and the fishermen, pirates,
writers, drunks, all that.

207
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,335
The lifestyle outside of
mainstream was welcome here

208
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:56,770
pretty much.

209
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:58,470
Whatever floats your boat.

210
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:58,839
You know.

211
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,641
It's all good.

212
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:05,713
♪

213
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:24,163
Over a century ago,
Provincetown was a hard working

214
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:28,935
fishing village with
multigenerational families of

215
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:29,469
fishermen.

216
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,772
My name's Bo Gribbon.

217
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,874
My father fished, and I was

218
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,810
pretty much raised
here my whole life.

219
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,878
Where I'm from.

220
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,713
This is who I am.

221
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,215
But it used to be like two out

222
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,351
of three families in this town,

223
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,286
this community, were
fishing families.

224
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,721
Most of them are now gone.

225
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:51,624
And we're really
like a minority.

226
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,526
Used to be a fishing community

227
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,296
with a homo sexual problem.

228
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,967
The first Portuguese fishermen
arrived here in 1840.

229
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,669
The main families created a

230
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,870
community built around fishing,

231
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,905
and this town lived off that

232
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:09,241
industry well into
the 20th century.

233
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,844
It persisted even when I was

234
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,579
here, keeping up the
blessing of the fleet.

235
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,181
These days however, there are

236
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:19,218
fewer and fewer boats to bless.

237
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:27,193
My name's Scott roe, I'm a
commercial fishermen, fourth

238
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:27,494
generation.

239
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:30,562
It was cool back then,
started when I was five.

240
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,699
70 and 80 boats here, five or

241
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,566
six feet now, now it's just down

242
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,268
to like seven or eight.

243
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,604
Now I'm proud of my heritage and

244
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,372
I would never do anything else.

man, look at it.

I'm going to do this until
I can't move anymore.

247
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,618
We were all on the town like

248
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,954
clock work, 2:30, 3:00 in the

249

morning, it's quiet, the town's

250
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,791
been ripped up all night long.

251
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,027
We come down here,
hit the water.

What could be better?

253
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,932
Good time to be here,
and nice weather today.

Yeah, nice day.

Little breezy.

256
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,637
Might be a little nautical.

257
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:11,972
A little bit.

00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:13,740
I'm sure I'll be fine, I've

259
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,074
watched the deadliest catch.

Are you ready?

Used to be this was the
best thing in the world.

267

The greatest thing about

268
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,828
fishing, you were kind of like a

269
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,830
cowboy, like a pioneer, you

270
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,631
could go out, and as hard as you

271
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,401
could push, competition
was welcomed.

272
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,836
We were fiercely independent.

273
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,471
Independence is like little by

274
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,638
little by little taken away.

Is there a limited number
of stuff out there?

in Se 9,000 bucks, from that

It all turned to ship
around the break water.

It starts like
blowing like 30, 35.

you're staying dry, you're
not making any money.

Yeah, it's a bummer.

309

smell the coconut, another
big trick we have.

311
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,339
Now the guys decide they like

this part of the beach, right.

313
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,211
So they're all out
here, nude sunbathing.

314
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,946
So I pick um my glasses and I

315
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,549
tell them, wow, look at
the breasts on that girl.

316
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,052
And you give it to them and they

317
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,121
see something they weren't
expecting to see.

318
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:47,426

Got Anthony Bourdain on deck

nothing to eat.

324
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,274

498

547

enforcement took a harsh look at

548
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:24,670
the drug and it became much
harder to get legally.

549

on addiction to opioids.

And also told that they're
not all that addictive.

609
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,304
We started handing out

we took data that was [ Bleep ],

614
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,449

it and said prescribe it to

everyone, they won't
get addicted.

00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,544
Raspberry cream pie
for me, thank you.

723
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:49,380
This is not something
we see a lot of.

724
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:50,781
Old school pie like this
and this number of them.

725
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:51,950
Serving made here.

726
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,886
And they're all the original
recipes from the '60s.

727
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:57,923
The index cards are so old,
they're all faded yellow.

728
00:30:57,924 --> 00:30:58,924
Exotic for me.

729
00:30:58,925 --> 00:30:59,625
Really?

730
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,559
Oh yeah.

731
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,227
How's business?

732
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:03,428
It's getting better.

733
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:06,331
The drug problem has
gotten rampant.

734
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:10,068
Took over may 1st, 2012, I
was broken into four times.

735
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,636
It wasn't just me, it was

736
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,104
multiple businesses
time after time.

737
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,906
I came in one morning to open

738
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:17,075
up, and I had a guy in front of

739
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:20,745
the rebel star and he got
up, pulled a knife out.

740
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,013
I realized it really wasn't

741
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,314
worth anything over a knife.

742
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,849
What you're doing
here is terrific.

743
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,954
A man can go and get a pot open

744
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:29,688
Turkey sandwich and good slice

745
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:31,924
of pie, it's a beautiful thing.

746
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,650
My name is Heather Taylor.

747
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,488
I'm a mother of three.

748
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:09,995
The two older kids
experienced my addiction.

749
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:12,363
My addiction started with pills.

750
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,065
I started sniffing heroin.

751
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,002
I shot up for the first time,

752
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:20,838
and shortly there later I
found out I was pregnant.

753
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,207
I had my daughter.

754
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,708
She was in the hospital for six

755
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,311
weeks because she was addicted

756
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:31,349
to the methadone and I had
to watch my baby go through

757
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:31,917
withdraws.

758
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:34,885
My son was four, and my daughter

759
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,522
was six weeks when
they were taken away.

760
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:44,029
I lost my kids for 33
days shy of two years.

761
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,234
I became serious
about my recovery.

762
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:53,438
So is this the bad part of
town or is this just a place

763
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:56,607
where you're unlikely
for people to find you.

764
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,677
Just a place where people
are unlikely to find you.

765
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,246
I wouldn't necessarily say there

766
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:04,915
was a bad part of greenfield.

767
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,419
I mean, it's probably pretty

768
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,356
spread out, bad, I
guess you'd say.

769
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,224
What would you do?

770
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:13,258
Come here to shoot up?

771
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:13,959
Yep.

772
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,893
You know we'd go down here and

773
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:16,927
just hang out down there.

774
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,897
I bet if we walked along here,

775
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,466
we'd find needles and bags.

776
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,401
You know.

777
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:23,901
Basically you'd come down

778
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:27,238
here, shoot up, and what
are you going to nod out?

779
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:30,208
Just sit down... just
sit down and hang out.

780
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:32,977
A day like this, hang out under

781
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:34,212
the underpass over there.

782
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:37,815
Not exactly la vida loca.

783
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,650
As you can see the trash and

784
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,586
yuck, it's dirty and gross.

785
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:46,091
There's probably people
who live down here.

786
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:46,792
Really?

787
00:33:46,793 --> 00:33:52,397
Yeah, there's a lot of
homeless people in greenfield.

788
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:53,898
What do you think now when

789
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,401
you see somebody who's
junk sick on the street?

790
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:58,836
It gives me that
yuck, sick feeling.

791
00:33:58,837 --> 00:33:59,937
And it scares me.

792
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:02,973
It reminds me why I don't
want to be out there.

793
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:03,909
It's just scary.

794
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:08,779
A friend of mine overdosed
January 1st of this year.

795
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,148
And my brother-in-law overdosed

796
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,450
in Wendy's bathroom
and they found him.

797
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:14,152
And they brought
him back to life.

798
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,253
He was dead in the bathroom.

799
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:19,257
Uh-huh.

800
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:22,660
So this is my narc cam.

801
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,162
I carry this around, I have one

802
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:28,299
of these in my house and
I have one in my car.

803
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,800
I have a fear that my husband's

804
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,270
going to relapse and I'm
going to find him dead.

805
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,806
You just put this in here and
squirt it up their nose.

806
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,475
Now in most cases, as I

807
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,310
understand it, they're
right out of it.

808
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:44,682
They're right out of
it and instantly sick.

809
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:45,284
They don't wake up happy.

810
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,152
But they wake up.

811
00:34:46,153 --> 00:34:47,218
Somebody's blue there.

812
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:47,986
On the floor.

813
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:49,454
Are you saving that life?

814
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,289
Yep, saving that life.

815
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:51,590
Absolutely.

816
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:54,293
And then kicking
their [ bleep ].

817
00:34:58,664 --> 00:34:59,331
Better now?

818
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,065
Life better now?

819
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,999
Absolutely.

820
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,568
My kids have been
home three years.

821
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,903
You know, I no longer
have to watch my back.

822
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:11,242
You know, I live a pretty
straight and narrow life.

823
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,243
Which, you know, people might

824
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,479
say is boring, but I
love my life today.

825
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,314
I'm grateful.

826
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:16,647
Where are we headed?

827
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,648
This way.

828
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,016
Oh, okay.

829
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,651
To the recover projects.

830
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:24,255
This is where my
recovery started.

831
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,557
Started near lay decade ago

832
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:27,925
in one of the two main streets

833
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:32,863
of greenfield, the recover
project is community-based.

834
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,332
An open arms program aimed at

835
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,601
helping addicts stay clean.

836
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:42,240
Given the opioid heroin

837
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:43,408
addiction in our community, we'd

838
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,743
like to start the conversation.

839
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:46,877
What happened at that point of

840
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,112
our life, what that was like.

841
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,715
So as a child growing up in a

842
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:53,784
home of addiction, I didn't

843
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,253
understand how they could do all

844
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:57,087
the stuff that they did to me

845
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,289
and my brother and sister.

846
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,724
Like don't you love me enough?

847
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:01,892
Then I became a mother, and then

848
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,594
I became a heroin addict.

849
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:09,467
And I did all that
stuff to my kids.

850
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:10,369
My doctor was my
biggest drug dealer.

851
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,737
Married, had a baby, fell
down the stairs, two jobs,

852
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,038
college on top of it.

853
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,440
Next thing I know I'm on the

854
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:17,242
prescriptions, that's where
it all began for me.

855
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:20,077
What are the odds you're
going to own a house?

856
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,879
What's the odds to
have a nice car?

857
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,414
Any car?

858
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:25,082
A place to live, all that stuff?

859
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:29,554
Seems less and less
likely all the time.

860
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:32,723
When you stick a spike in
your arm and I wouldn't.

861
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,159
So I have this picture in my

862
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,994
head which got the phone call my

863
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,329
daughter's father had been in

864
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,998
the accident and I just had a

865
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,000
c-section and come in with this

866
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,802
need toll give me at Van and all

867
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,972
I needed was a hug, like I just

868
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:49,507
needed someone to give me a hug,

869
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:51,476
I care about you, Kaitlyn, and

870
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,244
everything is going to be okay.

871
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:58,082
I'll tell you something
really shameful about myself.

872
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:03,621
The first time I shot up I
looked at myself with a big

873
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:03,922
grin.

874
00:37:03,923 --> 00:37:08,092
Something was missing in me
whether it was a self-image

875
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:11,362
situation, whether it was a

876
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:14,198
character flaw, stable family,

877
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,467
the suburbs, I had a lot of

878
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,136
advantages, there was some dark

879
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,205
genie inside me that I hesitate

880
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,308
to call a disease that led me to

881
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:25,610
dope, you know, I didn't have

882
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:29,647
anyone else who could have
talked me out of what I was

883
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:32,182
doing, but intervention
wouldn't have worked.

884
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,653
I didn't have a child, I have a

885
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,655
7-year-old daughter now who
I never would have had.

886
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,857
I never would have thought... I

887
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:42,660
looked in a mirror and I saw

888
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:45,363
somebody worth saving or that I

889
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,998
wanted to at least try
real hard and save.

890
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:53,504
You know, anybody can find
themself very easily in this

891
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,072
situation and, you know, I look

892
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,007
back on that and I think about

893
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,577
what I'll tell my
daughter, you know.

894
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:02,079
You know, that was daddy.

895
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,714
Ain't no doubt about it but I

896
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,517
hope I'll be able to say
that was daddy then.

897
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:09,887
This is daddy now that I'm
alive and living in hope.

898
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:10,188
Thank you.

899
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:14,493
Good.

♪

901
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:30,841
In Massachusetts the clambake
is a ritual going back

902
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:33,277
to the Flintstones, before the

903
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:34,845
pilgrims, today at the long

904
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,714
standing locals only shooting

905
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:41,218
club, shoots and Veren in German

906
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,054
for the immigrants who started

907
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,556
this ray takes me through the

908
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,057
fascinating and arcane process

909
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:50,561
of creating an
old-school clambake.

910
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:55,866
Basically we build a kiln
with hardwood and stone.

911
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,235
We burn it down, remove the wood

912
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:01,271
and cover it with seaweed and

913
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,207
corn hunks and we put our clams

914
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:06,544
and lobsters and corn in there
like a pressure cooker.

915
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,913
We've got a pig
hiding in there also.

916
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,247
No, no, no.

917
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:14,619
We'll pull a tusker out and

918
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,620
you'll see what we have here.

919
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:16,321
Let's eat.

920
00:39:16,322 --> 00:39:18,924
All right.

921
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,758
First some good chowder and

922
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:23,227
there really is only one kind of

923
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:26,263
chowder, new England
clam chowder.

924
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:27,432
Mm-mm.

925
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:31,802
That is good.

926
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:37,808
Steamer clams, lobster,
corn, Potatoes.

927
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:44,615
Pretty luxurious clambake here.

928
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:45,451
That was amazing.

929
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:47,652
Absolutely.

930
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:50,788
Everybody's attention
for a second.

931
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,290
The awareness task force came

932
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,625
together several months ago.

933
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,961
I don't think we realized how

934
00:39:56,962 --> 00:40:00,197
quickly this could turn
into a cite cyst for us.

935
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:03,333
Everybody in the room has
been impacted by narcotics in

936
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,336
some way, the opiod task force

937
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,473
is a grassroots response.

938
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:10,307
Doctor, law enforcement led by

939
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,677
Franklin county sheriff Chris

940
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:15,980
Donilon, addiction specialist

941
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:19,817
and addicteds themselves are
coming together to find a

942
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:20,652
community-based solution to what

943
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:22,553
is a public health crisis rather

944
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:23,821
than a criminal justice problem.

945
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,022
A great opportunity to come

946
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,458
here tonight to break bread and

947
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:28,393
look at the successes that we

948
00:40:28,394 --> 00:40:31,529
have had so far, think what
makes me more proud than

949
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,997
anything else about living in

950
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:34,999
Franklin county is that we will

951
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,902
not sit back and wait for
anybody else to solve this

952
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,336
problem for us.

953
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:41,371
We'll be a model for the
commonwealth and nation on how

954
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,252
we save our young people
and save our community.

955
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:50,314
The city is the place where

956
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:53,551
all the bad stuff is supposed to

957
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:55,986
happen, not nice towns
like greenfield.

958
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,354
It isn't the image that people

959
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:00,925
had 20 years ago, a junkie
in an alley using a needle.

960
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:01,727
It's not.

961
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:03,227
It's your kids, your neighbors.

962
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,929
The worst I think is when you

963
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,931
have these young people who

964
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,365
break a leg and they go to the

965
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,867
doctor and get a prescription

966
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:12,670
for oxy and become
addicted to it.

967
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:19,376
These are any kid who plays
a high school sport.

968
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:20,845
Heroin was around, pills were

969
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,713
around but we didn't
have people dying.

970
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,783
Once you've been busted for

971
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:29,086
heroin, that's a hard
thing to live down.

972
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,856
Got to get rid of that shame

973
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:33,891
factor to deal with
it address it.

974
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:36,594
Get support from the community.

975
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:41,398
I feel like we'll lose a
generation, 18 to 22, the

976
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,700
district attorney, the police

977
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:46,403
department are all united this.

978
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:52,309
Task force is home to a
matter of a hundred people.

979
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,913
I lost one daughter to drugs.

980
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:59,884
You know, whatever it takes.

981
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:02,620
Let's start by being
honest with ourselves.

982
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:05,455
As a nation for decades we were

983
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,826
perfectly happy to write off
whole neighborhoods, whole

984
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:11,428
cities, whole generations
of young men and women.

985
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,798
As long as it was an inner city

986
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:15,265
problem, an urban problem which

987
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,468
is to say a black people

988
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,270
problem, a brown people problem,

989
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,272
send them to prison into a

990
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,909
system from which
they'll never maybe.

991
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,310
Maybe now that it's come home to

992
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:30,347
roost and the high school
quarterback, your next-door

993
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:33,751
neighbor, your son, your
daughter, now that grandma is

994
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,786
likely to be a junkie as anyone

995
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,688
else we'll accept there's never

996
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,590
been a real war on drugs.

997
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:41,659
War on drugs implies an us

998
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,127
versus them and all over this

999
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:46,163
part of America, people are
learns there is no them.

1000
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,965
There is only us.

1001
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:50,936
And we're going to have to
figure this out together.
