00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,490
Meaning... good.

370
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,225
And you could take it
to your dimension.

371
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,861
So who fishes here?

372
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:36,396
You fish?

373
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,096
Yeah.

374
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,197
What are you fishing for?

375
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,399
Multiple fishing.

376
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,200
Yeah.

377
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:47,539
Snapper, your parrot.

378
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,608
Business better or worse?

379
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,377
Okay, worse.

380
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:53,579
Fishing is a problem.

381
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,115
This is a fishing village
for now, at least.

382
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,917
All throughout the Caribbean,

383
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,752
fish stocks are in decline and

384
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,721
making a living from the sea is

385
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,790
getting harder and harder.

386
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:11,597
So right here, it's
actually the fishing area.

387
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:13,465
We're trying to revive the fish

388
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,566
stock around the island.

389
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:19,471
So if this becomes a protected
sanctuary, what are

390
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,706
you doing far living?

391
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,908
We'll have to go
further out to sea.

392
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,276
That means more gas.

393
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,579
More gas, and less fish.

394
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,581
So it's a strain, right.

395
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,451
Is there a future for the

396
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:35,053
traditional fishing industry in

397
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:38,490
Jamaica or do you think like
every place else in the

398
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,325
Caribbean, is it going to end up

399
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,793
an entirely tourist economy?

400
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,129
It's going to belong
to the tourist.

401
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,797
This place, I can tell you

402
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:50,769
something, I live up the
road, love the spot.

403
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,640
Blackwell, I cannot
fish in there.

404
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:58,276
Here's what I'm kind of getting
here, rich people want

405
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:02,113
to live what they see as a
simple life, in their minds,

406
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:06,518
they want to live the life
of a Jamaican fishermen.

407
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,653
They want to live the life of

408
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,355
somebody that doesn't
have a lot of money.

409
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,691
But the people who actually do

410
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:13,959
that now are giving up their

411
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,196
living and essentially
given the tourist sector?

412
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,698
There's weird irony
at work here.

413
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,833
Who gets to live in paradise?

414
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:22,769
Nobody.

415
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,472
Because guess what... you
have a point, there's a

416
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:30,476
lot of things going
on here, right?

417
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,143
I read a piece of paper a couple

418
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:36,948
months ago that's going
on down here, all right.

419
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,451
Native here, there
are no beaches.

420
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,986
This architect's model sits

421
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:43,689
in one of golden eye's offices,

422
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,223
showing what the coastline will

423

look like if all goes
according to plan.

424
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:57,395
They've going to
come inside here.

425
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,808
I'm no expert on local
politics, whatever is going on

426
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:10,809
here has clearly stirred
up some strong emotions.

427
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:20,585
The school kid, they
also want to own that.

428
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:33,064
Wait a minute, I'm talking
wait a minute.

429

Stop that.

430
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,215
Stop talk.

431
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:44,884
All right.

432
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,251
Big man, stop talk.

433
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:46,586
Why?

434
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,688
Come here, come here.

435
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,256
Sit down.

436
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,558
Don't do that.

437
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,462
Don't do that.

a wealthy tourist?

445
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,122
I couldn't tell you.

446
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,123
I was in the service industry

447

cooking people's food for most

448
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,293
of my working life, so it's not

449
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:36,294
like I have anything against
it, but I don't know.

450
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:44,468
Let us find the spirit
in man and travel.

451
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:53,945
Because we are here in the
present, this is coming.

452
00:25:55,655 --> 00:26:03,655
And we are going to
go on into there.

453
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:11,770
If one man die, all man dead.

454
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:19,771
And if one man live,
all man live.

One moon, one sun, multipurpose
in the energy on life.

connected to the universe.

It's Jamaica, let's accept as a

to paradise as it gets, right?

466
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:33,919
This place I'm staying was built

467
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,755
by a guy who lived here two
months out of the year.

468

That place down there,
probably the same.

It's based on people
tough balance.

551
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,182
The engine that's going to

552
00:31:57,183 --> 00:31:58,849
preserve or safe is depended on

553
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,351
who's coming to look and what

554
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:01,987
they're willing to pay
to come and look.

555
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:02,521
Uh-huh.

556
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:04,189
Can there be a balance
do you think?

557
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:09,827
Can a place this
beautiful be unspoiled?

558
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:10,062
Forever.

559
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:11,329
I think it could be a couple

560
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:17,402
hundred places like
this in Jamaica.

561
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:19,337
As long as there are people who

562
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,706
can go and spend some money in

563
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:22,873
communities, go to little

564
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,543
restaurant, go to a little bar,

565
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,179
go to, you know, shopping.

566
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,584
That's essential for
Jamaica to really thrive.

567
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,920
If life were a bond film, who

568
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,488
would you be in a bond film?

569
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:41,726
Well, there's only one
hero in the bond film.

570
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,094
You'd be the hero?

571
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,762
I'd have to be, yeah.

572
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:48,866
I don't know that I'd be the

573
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:51,002
villan, I'd be like number 17.

574
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:56,241
He doesn't have a happy end,
and his end is kept short.

575
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:59,211
Yeah.

576
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,538
What we're all looking
for, isn't it?

577
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:32,443
The perfect beach.

578
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:40,444
Remote, uncluttered,
cold, local beer.

579
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:48,552
The perfect end to a long,
and well, bumpy road.

580
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:58,136
Winnerford's beach is that
beach, mostly locals, a few

581
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:01,739
clued in visitors, bright
sand, clear, warm water.

582
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:08,913
And of course, local food.

583
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:13,584
This is aki, Jamaica
favorite dish.

584
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,787
Typically in Jamaica, we
use it as a breakfast.

585
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:21,859
Cynthia and Dennis run
this place and come highly

586
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,161
recommended.

587
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:22,794
I'm told this is the spot for

588
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:25,096
the got to have it or you ain't

589
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:29,334
been to Jamaica
aki and saw fish.

590
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:33,371
Rehiydrated and cooked, it

591
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:35,806
happens to be toxic if you
don't handle it right.

592
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,943
Now they say the
best... in Jamaica.

593
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:39,511
Anywhere.

594
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:47,118
And yeah, also some banana.

595
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,786
That is delicious.

596
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:52,523
Cynthia's friends joy and

597
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:53,791
Margerie have restaurants on the

598
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,127
beach, here too it's in
danger of redevelopment.

599
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,329
And all this might disappear

600
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:06,330
into the everchurning
wheel of, well... ♪

601
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,146
It is a public beach.

602
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:18,316
It has been one of the
best beach in Jamaica.

603
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:21,352
The beach was left to give
the poor people of Jamaica.

604
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,887
So the government takes it

605
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,489
over, supposedly to make it a

606
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,056
public space, but they want to

607
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,226
sell it to, what a hotel group?

608
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:31,996
Yeah, they want to
make like a resort.

609
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:33,998
There were a lot of islands

610
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,032
on the Caribbean where you're

611
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,834
not allowed to own a beach.

612
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,269
Meaning all beaches are public.

613
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,005
Even if it's an exclusive hotel,

614
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,740
at least theoretically,
anybody can go.

615
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:43,542
Right.

616
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:44,942
Here it's different.

617
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,612
Here if you can buy a house and

618
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,680
the beach, if you, you're a

619
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:53,351
hotel, you can make
it a private beach.

620
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:55,686
Meaning, they don't let
the locals or venders.

621
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:56,555
They can keep people out.

622
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:57,622
Right.

623
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,525
How many public access beaches
are there in this area?

624
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:01,692
Just one.

625
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:02,194
One.

626
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,094
This one.

627
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,062
No more.

628
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:04,963
No more.

629
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:05,864
No more beach.

630
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:07,298
We have other beaches around,

631
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,567
you know, we have like blue

632
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:12,870
lagoon which is a private beach.

633
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,705
And this is the only public one.

634
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:15,241
You know.

635
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:19,877
Yeah, what happens if, I
mean, that would be sort of

636
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,879
ridiculous if Jamaicans can't go

637
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,047
to the beach in Jamaica.

638
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:31,048
Exactly.

639
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,991
There are two sides to
every story, of course.

640
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,826
And the government claims
they'll still have access to

641
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:36,428
their beach.

642
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:37,462
We don't trust them.

643
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:38,929
We do not believe what they say.

644
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,565
They can do what they want.

645
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:44,802
If they want to get us off and

646
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:49,340
they don't do anything on it.

647
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:57,341
Right.

648
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:02,019
What kind of monstrous human

649
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,321
being or organization would

650
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,089
disblas the people
from their own beach?

651
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,190
Or their freedom?

652
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:06,992
Thank you very much.

653
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:12,129
We would like... we are
like we're in prison.

654
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:17,802
We have nowhere to come
and swim when it's hot.

655
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,471
So we the people, we are in
court with the government

656
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,807
because we do not want them to

657
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:24,675
take our one and only beach we

658
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,611
have in Jamaica, Portland.

659
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,112
What do you think
your chances are?

660
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,980
Do you think your
chances are good?

661
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:30,849
You're going to win?

662
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:31,517
Yes.

663
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:34,218
I've been fighting for
over seven years.

664
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,486
Seven years?

665
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:36,288
Seven years.

666
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:40,458
I said I'm going to fight
until I reach the top.

667
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:43,027
When I reach the top and I
lose, I feel much better.

668
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,161
But I'm not giving up.

669
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,863
Let's face it, there are only

670
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,566
so many beaches in this world.

671
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:51,802
Even fewer unspoiled beaches,

672
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,972
and even fewer
beaches like this.

673
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:58,208
I mean that's one of the
things that's nice about this

674
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:02,547
area is it's not a big resort

675
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:04,014
area like some of
the other parts.

676
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,750
And the food is amazing.

677
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,752
Right.

678
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:08,086
Delicious.

679
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:09,820
You can't get this at the hotel.

680
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,989
Not like this.

681
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,758
So fresh.

682
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:14,593
Right.

683
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:16,226
Really, really, really tasty.

684
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:20,164
I have to come back
here like tomorrow.

685
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:20,766
Okay.

686
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,567
Whenever people come here and

687
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,201
they have a problem, they go to

688
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,337
the sea and they look over there

689
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,005
and the ocean and when they're

690
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,608
finished, they never
have a problem again.

691
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:35,045
It goes right in the
water and down.

692
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,747
And I hope that the world can

693
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,750
see what is going on and that

694
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,285
they can come out and enjoy the

695
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:45,856
beauty of the beach and the
people and the love at the
