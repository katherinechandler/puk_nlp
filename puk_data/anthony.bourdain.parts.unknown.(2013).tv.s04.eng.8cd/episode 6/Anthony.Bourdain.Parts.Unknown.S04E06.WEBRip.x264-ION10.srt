6
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:47,347
that I am greeted
warmly by strangers.

7
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,648

8

about, seen in the news.

9
00:00:52,153 --> 00:01:00,153

27
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:30,351

Finally.

29
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,356
Tehran.

30

City of nearly 8 million people.

31
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:42,762
Capital of Iran.

32
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,698
Like their neighborhoods
of Rome this feels like.

33
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,734
After all of this time I

34
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,369
finally have my chance to see a

35
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,137
country I heard so much about.

36
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,039
Weather is nice.

40
00:02:59,146 --> 00:02:59,480
Delicious.

41
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:07,481
Thank you.

42
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,729
Once upon a time there was an

43
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,000
ancient kingdom where they found

44
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:26,072
a lot of magical black
stuff under the ground.

stuff.

49
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:31,512
And when they wouldn't share.

50
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:35,114
The people of the ancient
kingdom got mad.

51
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:38,318
They voted and their leader said

52
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,189
the magical black stuff
is ours to keep.

53
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,659
But the other kingdoms wear
frayed of losing all of the

54
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,628
magical black stuff so they gave

55
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:55,335
money to some bad men to
get rid of the leader.

56
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,704
They put back in power
another leader.

57
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:01,107
And they gave him money too.

58
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,810
To some he was a good king.

59
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:11,050

This time even madder.

64
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:21,494
So they scared the
king away forever.

65
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:28,635
And then things started
to get really messed up.

66
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,337
Okay.

67
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:32,071
That's a simplistic, incomplete

68
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:36,175
way to sum up 100-odd
years of Iranian history.

69
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,177
The point is there were a lot of

70
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,146
issues and differing agendas

71
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,548
leading to the explosion of rage

72
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:45,084
known as the Iranian
hostage crisis.

73
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:49,589
Look, we know what Iran
the government does.

74
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,591
George W. Bush famously called

75
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,093
them part of the axis of evil.

76
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,162
Their proxies in Iraq have done

77
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,263
American soldiers real harm.

78
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,531
There is no doubt of this.

79
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,000
But I hope I can be forgiven for

80
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,403
finding these undeniable truths

81
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:07,039
hard to reconcile with how we

are treated on the streets
everywhere we go..

83
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,583
So forget about the politics
if you can for a moment.

84
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:17,917
How about the food?

85
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,022

Why not?

104
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:17,276
Kabob wouldn't be complete
without Persian rice.

105
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:21,648
Fluffy, long grained, perfectly

106

anything you have ever had.

111
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,002
Bon apetit.

112
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:50,309
It's good.

113
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:58,310
It was a hopeful time
when I arrived in Iran.

114
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,453
A window had opened.

115
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:05,291
There had been a slight
loosening of restrictions.

116
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,993
There was optimism for a deal

117
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,061
that could lead to an easing of

118
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,799
crippling economic sanctions
imposed because of Iran's

119
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,066
continued nuclear program.

120
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:18,838
Trade restrictions very,
very difficult for everyone.

121
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,473
But there is a push happening

122
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,375
between opposing factions
in the government.

123
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:28,347
On one hand, Iranians have been

124
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,516
descendants of ancient per shah.

125
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:30,850
Empire of poetry.

126

Flowers, the highly influential

culture that goes back
thousand of years.

128
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,660
But the ruling clerical and
military class are at best

129
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:45,064
ambivalent and at worst
actively hostile to much of the

tradition.

131
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:50,236
So, the religious based
restrictions of speech, dress,

132
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,039

A lot of push and pull.

189
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,153
A lot of give and take.

190
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,055
When I first started coming here

191
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:34,761
you wouldn't hear pop music
in a restaurant or...

192
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,162
Now it is everywhere.

193
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,629
We have police they arrest

194
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,302
girls or women for having...
Not being covered enough.

195
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,337
It know it that we live with the

196
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:50,476
police in our head, you know.

197
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,344
One of the first things that

198
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:55,414
people will say when you
say, I'm going to Iran.

199
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,783
Yeah, but don't they make women

200
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:59,285
dupe this, this, this, this.

201
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:05,457
Actually... not so much,
not as much as our friend.

202
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,626
Compare and contrast, women

203
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,996
aren't allowed to drive
in Saudi Arabia.

204
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,197
That's right.

205
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:11,932
Or vote.

206
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:12,665
You can drive.

207
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,466
You can vote?

208
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:14,902
Yeah, of course.

209
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:15,869
Of course.

210
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,104
My sister is an accountant.

211
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,006
She has her own company.

212
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:24,944
Girls are allowed to do almost

213
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,478
everything, except if you want

214
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,147
to go and watch football.

215
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,315
Can't watch football?

216
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,382
We cannot.

217
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,651
Women's issues are often at

218
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:35,021
the spear point of change
or possible change here.

219
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:39,625
On one hand, prevailing
conservative attitudes demand

220
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:39,993
certain things.

221
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:41,160
On the other hand.

222
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,496
Iranian women are famously
assertive, opinionated.

223
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,367
A striking difference from
almost everywhere else in

224
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:48,635
region.

225
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:51,237
Why are we so friend leap
with the Saudis again?

226
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,072
Great question.

227
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:54,540
Really good question.

228
00:12:54,541 --> 00:13:02,148
I'm happy that you
asked that question.

229
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,749
Do you like it?

230
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,851
Are you happy here?

231
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,853
Look, I am at a point now

232
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,822
after five years where... I miss

233
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,357
certain thing as but home.

234
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,226
I miss my buddies.

235
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,095
I miss burritos.

236
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,763
I miss having certain beverages

237
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,900

It's become home.

244
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,378
Are you optimistic
about the future?

245
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,714
Yeah.

246
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:39,285
Especially, if it
finally happens.

247
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:39,486
Yeah.

248
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,721
Very much, actually.

249
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,723
Despite the hopeful nature of

250
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,960
our conversation, six weeks
after the filming of this

251
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,029
episode, Jason and his wife were

252
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,200
mysteriously arrested and
detained by the police.

253
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,435
Sadly in Iran, this sort of
thing is not an isolated

254
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,572
incident.

People have been
ridiculously nice to us.

Aren't you supposed to
be the axis of evil.

271
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,328
You are right.

Name of the pot.

Yes.

00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:25,156
will react when they see this?

558
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:26,857
They will start coming.

559
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:32,197
It is very important as

560
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:33,431
Iranians, that we are seen as

561
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:35,166
humans here, not the so-called

562
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,668
enemy or the darkness of Iran.

563
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,737
Like you go to any body's house

564
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:43,541
in Iran I am sure they
will welcome you.

565
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,042
The axis of evil.

566
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:49,013
We are not the axis of evil.

567
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,781
Just normal evil
look everybody else.

568
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:53,050
Ten years ago Iran was,

569
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:58,022
people they had hope for
future, young people.

570
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,524
They wanted to travel.

571
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,359
Had a little bit of money.

572
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,560
Because of sanction.

573
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,629
This sanction really
squeeze everybody.

574
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,897
Eight years, no foreign
investment here.

575
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,400
And soap it was very
difficult time.

576
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:13,037
And, in the population
is really young.

577
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,038
70% are under 35.

578
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:21,546
And they want to have good job,

579
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:22,713
they want to have families, but

580
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:26,384
is not possible now for them.

581
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:31,222
I hope we can have more faith

582
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,723
in the ordinary Americans,

583
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,226
because every little change in

584
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:39,597
the policy of the western
country, it really, really

585
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:47,598
affects our lives here.

586
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:04,422
The Miraud tower.

587
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:10,761
It rises 5,000 feet in the air

588
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,664
and looks out over
Tehran and beyond.

589
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:14,765
We were out on the observation

590
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,267
deck taking it all in, trying to

591
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:18,769
make some sense of it all.

592
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,871
Our time in Iran was coming to

593
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,308
an end and it was impossible to

594
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:25,142
say, was a window opening?

595
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:33,143
Or was it only a moment in
time before it shut again?

596
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:38,623
You learn pretty quickly that in

597
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:42,527
Iran, there is
plenty of gray area.

598
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:47,031
An undefined territory.

599
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:48,633
Where is the line?

600
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:55,873
It seems to change with
barely a moment's notice.

601
00:37:55,874 --> 00:38:01,346
Here it comes.

602
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:06,851
This isn't the first time
that we have experienced such

603
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:14,852
thing.

604
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:23,635
Please follow me.

605
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,747
Last day in Iran.

606
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:12,116
Night falls, and kids, like kids

607
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,118
anywhere, get in their rides and

608
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:19,790
head for anywhere
they can hang out.

609
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,226
American classics here.

610
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:24,629
Where do you get them?

611
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,497
Old men.

612
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:28,065
And then fix them up?

613
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:31,402
Yeah.

614
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:36,173
Mustang?

615
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,942
Camaro.

616
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:41,512
Camaro.

617
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:41,813
Firebird?

618
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:42,648
Pontiac.

619
00:39:42,649 --> 00:39:45,483
That's a perfect L.A.
car right there.

620
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:49,754
Is this a car club or
just people that come?

621
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:51,822
We hang out this way.

622
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:57,161
These are our friends.

623
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:58,328
One last thing everybody has

624
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,666
been telling me I have to try.

625
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:05,503
Iranian take-out pizza.

626
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:08,272
It comes with ketchup.

627
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,941
What do you think
about Iranian pizza?

628
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:11,810
Not bad.

629
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,511
Not bad.

630
00:40:12,512 --> 00:40:15,145
We don't put ketchup
on pizza, though.

631
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:20,184
I love ketchup.

632
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:23,688
I could spend my youth,
pretty much, doing this.

633
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:31,689
Hanging out in a parking lot?

634
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,835
Let's assume the worst.

635
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:40,204
Let's assume that you cannot see

636
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:41,506
any way to reconcile what you

637
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:47,011
think of Iran with your
own personal beliefs.

638
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:48,412
You just generally
don't approve.

639
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:48,914
Yeah.

640
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:50,548
I think those are exactly the

641
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:51,916
sort of places you should go.

642
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,083
Totally.

643
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,552
See who we're talking about

644
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,887
and where we're
talking about here.

645
00:40:56,888 --> 00:41:00,390
I think it's almost un-American
not to go to those

646
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:00,826
places.

647
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:01,660
You know?

648
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,594
I don't know that I can put

649
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:04,862
it in any kind of perspective.

650
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:07,865
I feel deeply conflicted.

651
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:15,866
Deeply confusing, exhilarating,

652
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:18,343
heartbreaking, beautiful place.

653
00:41:18,344 --> 00:41:21,912
Yeah.

654
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:29,913
Exactly.

655
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:37,027
American cars are crazy.

656
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:45,028
American cars are crazy
and they're fun.

657
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,807
The Iran I see on TV and read

658
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:52,943
about in the papers, it's
a much bigger picture.

659
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:58,783
Let's put it this way.

660
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:06,784
It's complicated.

661
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:24,474
After ten weeks, Yugane
was finally released.

662
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:28,145
But as I read these lines,
Jason remains a prisoner.

663
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:29,446
His future, the reasons for

664
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:33,350
their arrest, are still unknown.

665
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:36,854
One, two, three!

666
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:38,422
Thank you, guys.

667
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:42,492
We'll see you.

668
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:48,299
Thank you.
