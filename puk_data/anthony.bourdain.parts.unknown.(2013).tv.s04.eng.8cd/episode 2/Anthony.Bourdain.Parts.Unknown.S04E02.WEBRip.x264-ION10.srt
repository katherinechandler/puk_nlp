1
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:08,041
How does the joke begin?

2
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:11,878
Three men in a bar,
but it's not a bar.

3
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,380
Imagine the Bronx.

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:18,885
A corner, or maybe
a lunchenette.

5
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,620
Three men find themselves in the

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,455
same place at the same time.

7
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:27,227
Sitting at the counter
is Africa bombada.

8
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:31,131
Across the room is Milly Mel.

9
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:34,901
Door opens and who
walk compromises, D.J.

10
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:37,104
And created the musical style

11
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,939
that's become the sound track to

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,908
well, the whole wide world.

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,144
They nod at each other, screwed

14
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,113
over, cut out of the big money,

15
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:49,749
or just laugh of a the
absurdy of it all.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,751
Hip hop came from nowhere else,

17
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:59,092
it could have come from
nowhere else, but the Bronx.

18

00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,803
this the Bronx.

27
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:48,007
You've probably heard about it.

28
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,842
You may even have a pretty solid

29
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:53,346
image in your head of
what it looks like.

30
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,882
What it is like.

31
00:01:55,883 --> 00:02:00,187
Or maybe you can't
picture it at all.

32
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:02,655
The south Bronx sounds
familiar as a bad thing.

33
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,056
And the Bronx at one time was

34
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,359
said to be burning, wasn't it?

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,199
For the most part, the
Bronx is overlooked, the never visited

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,233
borough in New York City, which

37
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:17,837
is a shame because the Bronx is
a magical place with its own

38
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,173
energy, its own food,
vibe, and rhythm.

39
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,074
You've been to Brooklyn, maybe

40
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:27,013
it's time you took a
look at the Bronx.

41
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,850
August of 1973, the sister of

42
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,519
D.j. Cool herd was holding a

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,753
birthday party for herself in

44
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:39,292
the basement of 1520
central Avenue.

45
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,361
As he was playing the music on

46
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:44,096
his two disk turntable, he began

47
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:49,068
to slow the music down slow the

48
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,204
people stood up and took notice

49
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,572
and began asking him to do it

50
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,241
again, he did it again, they

51
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56,209
asked him to do it again, again,

52
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,710
he did it again and attracted

53
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,713
more and more people to his

54
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:01,382
performances, and people began

55
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:02,749
to imitate him, and that was the

56
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,217
beginning of hip hop music.

57
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:10,757
It started in the Bronx.

58
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,760
Moody's records, inside

59
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,794
rummaging for records just like

60
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,896
he used to do is the man, the

61
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:20,132
legend, one of the very select
few who started it all.

62
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,601
Who created the sound that

63
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:25,438
hundreds of millions of people
now claim as their own.

64
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,807
Google, who created hip hop?

65
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,810
Go ahead, you get, D.J. Cool.

66
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,579
It's a national landmark, right?

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,615
No, it's not, we're
working on it.

68
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,318
It's still the birthplace of

69
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,620
hip hop undisputed because I

70
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,821
didn't start it with four guys

71
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:45,458
in a club, I was inside
a residential building.

72
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,926
At the time, it wasn't really in

73
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:51,163
eye over the recreation room.

74
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,600
So she would watch for any

75
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,001
disturbance, it never happened,

76
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,769
and that's how it survived

77
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,606
because good music said itself,

78
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:00,973
good drug set itself, good

79
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,311
anything set itself, and
this was something good.

80
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:06,446
Was there a moment when you

81
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,614
realized this is big, this is

82
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,317
going to be, this is going
to spread way beyond my

83
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:10,651
neighborhood?

84
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:12,852
Never looked at it as that.

85
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:16,022
I saw it spreading, but it

86
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:24,023
reminded me of Fred Flinstone.

87
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,201
It's not going to be nothing.

88
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,037
So to say I don't have money and

89
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,839
all that, I'm rich in other

90
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,974
ways, but time magazine said

91
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:39,379
when music was created inside
the United States, Louis

92
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,314
Armstrong for jazz, Elvis

93
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:44,050
Presley for rock and roll, him

94
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:51,691
and Chuckie Berry, and
cool herc for hip hop.

95
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,526
Feel good?

96
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,327
Very good.

97
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:55,895
Historically, from the last

98
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,531
third of the 19th century in to

99
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,901
about 1920, it was Germany.

100
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:05,004
From about 1930 to about 1960,

101
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:11,678
the second language spoken
in the Bronx was Yiddish.

102
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,846
From 1965 onward, the second

103
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:19,686
language is Spanish, and
that's the way it is today.

104
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:23,690
It's got a reputation as a
tough place, crime, street

105
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,692
gangs, a lot of which goes back

106
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,360
to the way it was and some of

107
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,728
which, well like I said, it's

108
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:32,565
got a reputation as being tough.

109
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,734
The Bronx is, let's face it, a

110
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,269
big blank space in a
lot of people's minds.

111
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,871
Even people like me who live

112
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,873
what, ten minutes away, we don't

113
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,375
know anything about that big

114
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:45,412
area between Yankees
stadium and the Bronx zoo.

115
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:48,581
What you should know is
that the Bronx is big.

116
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,116
Really big.

117
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,384
And that it's a patchwork of

118
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:55,087
ethnic enclaves, a cross
section of the whole world.

119
00:05:55,088 --> 00:06:03,088
Every immigrant group
you could think of.

120
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:19,311
Justin, aka, Barren Imbrosha is

121
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:23,082
serving at the
culinary ambassador.

122
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:23,784
Let the dinner begin.

123
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:25,485
This is the porcupine.

124
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,620
For the cause of introducing

125
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,422
the delights of this mighty

126
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,991
borough to the ignorant,
well like me.

127
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,760
He's got a show on the TV, and

128
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,294
he throws parties where he

129
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,597
serves creatures that would make

130
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,799
Andrew Zimmer turn gray and

131
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,502
slump unconscious to the floor.

132
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:46,973
Explorer, and gourmet.

133
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:50,276
Bronx, it's so multifacetted,

134
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,678
but for some reason this is the

135
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,614
first place I take people.

136
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,183
This is oozes and imminents
that flavor of the Bronx.

137
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,686
And he knows what I like.

138
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:03,122
Places like this.

139
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:07,794
188 on 188th street and
the grand concourse.

140
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,630
Old school New York
Puerto Rican good stuff.

141
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,198
Get within 20 feet of this stuff

142
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,469
and prepare to lose
your freaking mind.

143
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,205
It is fried pig.

144
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,641
Ear, tongue, chopped
up and deep fried.

145
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,511
Off cut pig parts, deep fried.

146
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,646
What's not to like about that?

147
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:27,814
Yeah, the shoulder.

148
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,982
We're going to get
that in there.

149
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,551
Oh yeah.

150
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:35,187
Big piece of the skin,
just chopped up.

151
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,156
So skin.

152
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,024
Skin and fat?

153
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:37,825
Yeah.

154
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:40,026
It's almost like a
little meat candy bar.

155
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:45,498
That's amazing.

156
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,533
Amazing.

157
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,534
And then what else?

158
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,335
We need this.

159
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,003
Yes.

160
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,340
Puerto Rico on a skew.

161
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:58,511
The Bronx to me became a
place where I could really

162
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,679
engage my sensibility.

163
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,514
You could really just come here,

164
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,917
eat, drink, wine,
and just indulge.

165
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,387
This is pretty much the center
of the pork universe as

166
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,891
I've ever seen it in New York.

167
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,561
I don't any place porkier
than what I'm looking at.

168
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,428
This is exactly the kind of

169
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,064
thing I thought we'd lost in new

170
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,566
York, that one after the other

171
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,267
faded away in the neighborhood's

172
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,570
I lived in and all along, all

173
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,572
along it was there, underfoot, a

174
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,206
gusher of porky goodness.

175
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,374
There's a great line, which

176
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:33,245
is they say, in
France, Se la Bronx.

177
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,581
What do you think
this is the Bronx?

178
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,716
And this idea of music's really

179
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,384
mad or someone's making a mess.

180
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,554
To me I take that as
a point of pride.

181
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,590
To be the Bronx, it is where the

363
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,596
Jamaican community in Bronx
river in the south Bronx.

364
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,931
Jamaicans began arriving here

365
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,599
back in the 50s, and still

366
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:55,307
today, Jamaican food, culture,
the music, is all over.

367
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,776
Sun dial international
headquarters, makers of

368
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,945
traditional tonics and herbal

369
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,615
remedies, a Bronx
institution since the 70s.

370
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:08,287
This is enough ingredients,
this is the oil.

371
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:14,126
This one is used for any
type of bodily weaknesses.

372
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:17,796
Pops Baba as he's called,

373
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,298
grassroots bush doctor, healer,

374
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,967
he uses recipes passed from

375
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,470
mothers and aunties, roots,

376
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:27,306
spices, herbs, barks, and woods.

377
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,807
Wood root in the morning and

378
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,976
at night, it'll cure
what's wrong with you.

379
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,644
You're going to
have improvement.

380
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:37,483
Whatever ails, he is a cure.

381
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,152
Root wood cure for the
blood, bodies, nerves.

382
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,188
Intestinal cleanser and man

383
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,523
back, hopes to get your manhood

384
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:45,991
back among other things.

385
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:51,363
About 1956 that I
came to America.

386
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,099
So I could make it in the

387
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,369
apartment in the Bronx river.

388
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,671
And project smell up this roof,

389
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,006
they used to drive them.

390
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,841
Hey, what are you
doing in there?

391
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:06,345
What kind of hoekus poekus in there doing.

392
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:10,782
And I'd go in the car, and
I'd sell it in the Bronx.

393
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:14,353
The Bronx is the best
place in America.

394
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:18,057
Nowhere like the Bronx.

395
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:23,895
Up north a ways in west
Jamaica, another working class

396
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,231
community where subway service

397
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,098
is limited and yet people to

398
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,868
have to get up, go to work, and

399
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:35,607
make the long hump
to another borough.

400
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:43,608
Afterwards, a person
could use a drink.

401
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,752
And if you're a Jamaican person,

402
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,254
you could use the every day

403
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,088
drink of back home, any time of

404
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,258
day and night, ray and nephew.

405
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,093
It is a very strong Jamaican

406
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,562
white rum that we use from

407
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,398
everything to drinks
here in this bar.

408
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,269
You get it with cranberry
juice, milk, or water.

409
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,404
Water would be in every nephew

410
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:10,108
would be ray and
nephew in the Bronx.

411
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:13,111
It's a very fast, free form

412
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,446
riff diatribe about life in the

413
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,614
Bronx and what's happening on

414
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,450
the news, in hip
hop, or last night.

415
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,452
Growing up in the Bronx

416
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,087
the city. Olated from the rest of

417
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,456
you know what I'm saying, the

418
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,992
other city has like city bite,

419
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,294
the Bronx doesn't get that.

420
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,796
People on a boat and go to

421
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,464
Staten island before they
ride up to the Bronx.

422
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:35,133
I have to reluctantly have to

423
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,802
be part of of the problem.

424
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,137
It's going en to junk if ied,

425
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:43,442
that's not happening
any time soon.

426
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,676
It's not.

427
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,346
There's no owner right here.

428
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:51,817
This is the man right here
who made today possible.

429
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:52,652
Thank you.

430
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:54,286
I am happy here.

431
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,988
Andly drink more of your ray and

432
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,524
nephew, regardless of what it

433
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:04,029
might be doing to my brain,
but then, I will eat.

434
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,664
What is this?

435
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,533
Pigtail.

436
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,199
Yeah.

437
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,135
Awesome.

438
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:13,004
Oh hell, I love this.

439
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:13,172
Oh.

440
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:15,707
Man, that looks good.

441
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,843
People sort of, stop paying

442
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:21,513
attention to the Bronx when
it wasn't burning anymore.

443
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,515
When fort Apache was something

444
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,550
we didn't have to think about.

445
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,018
Let's say this is the
neighborhood where they

446
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:27,720
perfected it.

447
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,488
Right.

448
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,356
Do you remember your first time?

449
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:30,822
I remember my first time.

450
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,491
How do you feel, first time?

451
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,192
I cried.

452
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:38,029
And that summer, 15 times, stop

453
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,698
and frisk, thrown up against the

454
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:43,335
gate, fingers to our genitals
cops looking for gun.

455
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:46,405
But you remember that, you
remember your first time.

456
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:49,875
When you lose your stop
and frisk virginity.

457
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,177
I wonder why?

458
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:56,047
Is it because off CNN show
or it is it just because...

459
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,716
I've been arrested.

460
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,585
If you hang out here long

461
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:02,220
enough, I can get you
stop and frisked.

462
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:05,757
They talk about DIY culture,
about do it yourself.

463
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:08,560
And you better be able to do it

464
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,895
your [ Bleep ] self in the Bronx

465
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,230
because often, nobody sells
going to do it for you.

466
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:16,902
When you go in the Bronx,
you're going back in time.

467
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,069
There are certain crimes that

468
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,040
will happen here that won't
happen here in Brooklyn or

469
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,308
Manhattan.

470
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:24,242
Purse snatchers.

471
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:24,544
Really?

472
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:25,744
There's still crackheads.

473
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,912
There's crackheads in front

474
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:28,414
of that over there, and they are

475
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:29,581
getting their cracks, and

476
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,550
they're not bothering anyone.

477
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:34,085
And they are respecting
parts of this community.

478
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,588
You see them every day.

479
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,256
There's a crackhead that's
been here for 25 years.

480
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,459
That takes some
determination now.

481
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,729
Listen, if I could be a
crackhead, I would be the best

482
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,431
crackhead possible.

483
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:48,266
I was a crackhead, and oh
listen, people have been

484
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:48,468
there.

485
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:53,439
No judgments.

486
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,609
Hey, what's up?

487
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:57,977
All right.

488
00:22:57,978 --> 00:23:00,612
Look, I'm thinking curry goat.

489
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,814
His uncle Vernon used to own

490
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,451
this place, but that
was three owners ago.

491
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:08,319
Now it's lammy's, people put too

492
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,624
much cinnamon in the goat,
which is a sin against god.

493
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,626
Lammy fixed things.

494
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,962
Curry goat and stewed ox tail

495
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:21,633
with rice and peas, collards,
and yes, Mac and cheese.

496
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:22,334
I can't resist.

497
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:25,937
I mean, correct me if I'm
wrong, there's a lot of good

498
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:26,473
food in the Bronx.

499
00:23:26,474 --> 00:23:27,773
There is, there is.

500
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:28,974
If people would like you know

501
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,476
get over their bias and come

502
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:33,111
above 96th street,
they would find out.

503
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,614
I mean if the Bronx were a

504
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:36,615
neighborhood in Manhattan, sort

505
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,450
of shrunk down, you'd have

506
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:39,818
hipsters crawling over over.

507
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,152
Oh my god.

508
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,322
If you live in the Bronx it's

509
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:48,860
not necessarily that you're
going to leave the Bronx.

510
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,830
Why would you go
past 149th street?

511
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,633
So all that, repping my
neighborhood, the ethnic pride

512
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,802
and all that, people
hold on to that.

513
00:23:56,803 --> 00:24:00,338
And that's true of Rylander

514
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,673
Avenue, that sort of stuff.

515
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:02,374
Even this.

516
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,810
Neighborhood was all
white until the '50s.

517
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,678
It's very recent the
whole immigrant...

518
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,346
Who lived here in the 50s?

519
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:09,181
All white people.

520
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:10,682
What kind of white people?

521
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:11,883
White white.

522
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:15,020
Like we enjoy milk white, we're

523
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,822
kissing dogs on the mouth.

524
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:19,024
It's moved forward, and there's

525
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,325
definitely this whole, you know,

526
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,828
like I'm from 233rd, you're from

527
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,497
225th, every ethnic
group has that.

528
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:26,532
And the next group that will

529
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,534
take over here is definitely

530
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,035
Mexicans, and the thing is, it's

531
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,036
an immigrant neighborhood.

532
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,705
It's not a matter who have owns

533
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,708
it, it's who owns it at
that time and they're next.

534
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:41,547
I enjoy good case Dee Yas.

535
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:45,751
We made the good decision
to come to Lamny's today.

536
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:46,252
Yeah.

537
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:49,087
Lammy's, I'm here all the time.

538
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,188
I live right there.

539
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,757
I'm always here for the curry

540
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,725
goat, Mac and cheese, you know.

541
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,161
Lammy's don't play, man.

542
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,785
The twos and the fives here

543
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:21,252
are the greatest trains because

544
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,754
they go from Bronx through

545
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,590
Manhattan all the way
through Brooklyn.

546
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:26,592
It's the only number of lines

547
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:29,728
that will get three
boroughs visibility.

548
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:30,563
The Bronx still here.

549
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:31,930
Yeah, it's still here.

550
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:36,134
But you know, like even that, I

551
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:39,905
mean that brings me
back, Tony, that sound.

552
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,973
Do you remember the first

553
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,909
time you put spray
paint on a wall?

554
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,577
Yeah.

555
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:48,146
When was that?

556
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:50,582
Uh, summer of '70.

557
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,652
Back then, seemingly overnight,
they were everywhere,

558
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:55,253
princes of the city, their

559
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,955
pieces stretching across city

560
00:25:56,956 --> 00:26:00,091
blocks, whole trains, evermore

561
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:04,095
audacious, some, by
this man, were artists.

562
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,631
In the late '70s, to be on of

563
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:07,498
a rooftop like this with a brew

564
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,500
or whatever, hanging out, we're

565
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,501
waiting for something to come

566
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,670
through with a cool letter or

567
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,172
like oh my god, look at that.

568
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,141
And kids are screaming, like, oh

569
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:18,109
my god, look, here it comes.

570
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,845
There's my mine.

571
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:20,679
There's mine, but what if you

572
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,480
thought the train was
on the left side.

573
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,315
Then you kind of messed up.

574
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,317
Oh no, it's on the right side.

575
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,353
And no, you're not screwed, you

576
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:32,123
wait until this train goes all

577
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:32,992
the way to Brooklyn
and comes back.

578
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:35,360
This was the audience
you had in mind?

579
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:35,995
Does matter?

580
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:38,496
I think all of us spoke
to each other back then.

581
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:39,965
Other arts.

582
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,499
It was just the rush of the

583
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,334
event, and then the accolades

584
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,870
you may or may not receive.

585
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:46,972
Not from the public,
but from your peers.

586
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:52,678
Futura 2000, his style
spread across the globe.

587
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,846
I miss those trains.

588
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,014
Others, not so much.

589
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:59,651
I get it, it went on and on

590
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,152
until it seemed there wasn't an

591
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,688
untagged, unmarked, bit of wall

592
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,690
or window in New York, but for a

593
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:06,992
while, it was a golden time.

594
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:09,194
Well the whole point
of being here... yeah.

595
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,829
Was to me what the Bronx was

596
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,363
about, not just the music and

597
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,332
the scene and coming up with the

598
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,235
parties of Bam and Herc and

599
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,838
everyone of that era, but
it's watching trains.

600
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,339
We used to call it benching.

601
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,874
You were watching work go by?

602
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,743
Absolutely.

603
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:26,411
Art lovers.

604
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:27,713
This was his museum.

605
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:30,048
Where he and his fellow artists

606
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,382
would meet and exchange ideas

607
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,384
and admire each other's work.

608
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,186
And it's jarring coming to learn

609
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,554
all those years later that it

610
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:39,190
was really all about this, about

611
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,192
a few seconds as their pieces

612
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,929
rode by to be
evaluated by peers.

613
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,365
There for a moment, then gone.

614
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,734
Like well all of their work from

615
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:52,070
that time, long since
removed or painted over.

616
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:56,374
Ultimately, the legacy...
Here, here's our legacy.

617
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,209
We don't have a
movement anymore.

618
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,277
The movement has been
given to the world.

619
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:07,278
And if you go to trains in Milan

620
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,755
and Paris, certainly not the

621
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:10,221
Russian system, but if you go

622
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,957
around the world,
they're bombed.

623
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:15,326
Their rail systems
are destroyed.

624
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:19,430
But I mean, today, if I could
have a train running...

625
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,232
It would be nice.

626
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:22,768
It would be epic.

627
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,135
I think any artist, Picasso,

628
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,937
if that concept was available,

629
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,739
like here is some public art

630
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:35,740
guys, threat run through
our countryside.

631
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:54,158
♪

632
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:09,340
Take the six trains to the ♪

633
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,496
take the six trains to the

634
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,498
end of the line, then do the

635
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,668
same for the number 29 bus.

636
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,171
Technically you'll still be in

637
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:40,478
the Bronx, but it kind
of won't feel like it.

638
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,648
City island is a fishing
village turned what?

639
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:44,682
A parking lot for pleasure

640
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,517
boats, and a long established

641
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,987
restaurant row for new yorkers.

642
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:52,824
Pick the perfect day
to come out here.

643
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:57,028
Desus says this place, and
Desus is always right.

644
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,529
How far from the
neighborhood by car?

645
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,331
Maybe 15, 20 minutes.

646
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,167
20 minutes.

647
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:04,169
That seems like a world away.

648
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:08,039
Yeah, but I want to buy
some nautical stuff.

649
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,875
This is New York City?

650
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:11,176
This is Cape Cod in the Bronx.

651
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:13,378
Many of my childhood memories,

652
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,180
get there and they're like oh

653
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,382
the beach is closed
far medical race.

654
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:18,917
It's not a day you go in the

655
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:23,021
water and come out with like
a maxi pad stuck to you.

656
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,023
Been there.

657
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,791
So you were here like
when, yesterday?

658
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,726
I was literally here yesterday.

659
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,695
Wow.

660
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,297
For my sister's graduation

661
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:33,098
because every time you have an

662
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,900
event of note in the Bronx, you

663
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,201
have to come celebrate
at city island.

664
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:39,270
I notice all the big
catering halls.

665
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:42,908
Yeah, get married, arraigned,

666
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,409
baby's not yours, come here.

667
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,912
Seashore restaurant, a
massive fish factory on the

668
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,947
water of a type I'm very

669
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:51,216
familiar with, having started my

670
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:54,385
cooking career in
one just like it.

671
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,221
I'm also a sentimental fool, and

672
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,924
I love this kind of thing.

673
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:01,826
Steamers, a true
taste of childhood.

674
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:04,262
Boiled striper and some snow

675
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:08,099
crab and a nice cold beer,
yes, thank you, Desus.

676
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,237
It's like a knighting ceremony.

677
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:15,640
Just kind of sit up, and
like oh, take it all in.

678
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:18,109
Enjoy guys.

679
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,477
Thank you.

680
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:20,811
I could have done
that myself, but...

681
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,113
That's part of it.

682
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:27,085
Part of the ambience.

683
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,586
This is the perfect place far

684
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,956
date, but it's the
worst food for a date.

685
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:34,025
Either a huge turnoff
or a huge turnon.

686
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,261
You might give a lady a preview

687
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,296
of what they're
about to get into.

688
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:41,099
All the little bib,
little sucking action.

689
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:48,173
Just let them know, in an
hour, this could be you.

690
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:48,975
Wow.

691
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:50,841
This is pretty awesome.

692
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,443
Saturday night, city island,

693
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,845
that's where people are going.

694
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,788
The first European settler

695
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:07,158
to come to the Bronx
came in 1639.

696
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,962
His name was Jonas Bronck.

697
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:14,732
In 1874, all the area west of

698
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,467
the Bronx river was the city and

699
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,469
in 1895, all the area east of

700
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,138
the Bronx river was the city,

701
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:22,173
and 1898, the city decided that

702
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,909
the two areas previously inexed

703
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,145
should also become a borough.

704
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,480
But what to call it since
it never had a name before?

705
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,649
They looked at the map and right

706
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,651
smack to the middle of the

707
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,819
territory ran the Bronx river,

708
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,188
so they named it after the

709
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,257
river, the borough of the Bronx,

710
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:41,592
and that is why it is called the

711
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:46,497
Bronx and not just plain Bronx.

712
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,833
If off question about the

713
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:55,173
Bronx, chances are Lloyd
Alton has the answer.

714
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:57,208
Born and raised here, he's never

715
00:32:57,209 --> 00:33:03,781
really left for
over seven decades.

716
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:07,518
This is a disappearing
aspect of New York for sure.

717
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,122
The real thing Jewish deli,
it is one of the last.

718
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,524
There used to be dozens of

719
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:14,859
places where you can get your

720
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,631
police cut, pastrami,
pickles with soda to drink.

721
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:25,536
The world series is going
on, Howard is on the air.

722
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,472
Suddenly you see a tongue of

723
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:30,708
flame licking up into the sky.

724
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,711
And he says, this is the kind of

725
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,481
thing that Jimmy taught us all,

726
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:39,217
ladies and gentlemen,
the Bronx is burning.

727
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:41,252
The old image of the Bronx as

728
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,221
middle class, mobile, healthy

729
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:46,724
area had survived up until
1977, this shattered it.

730
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:47,725
Right.

731
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:52,663
The Bronx was burning with
the story, and that stuck.

732
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:53,565
Politicians making the south

733
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,400
Bronx a poster child for what

734
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,568
was hopelessly wrong, would

735
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,170
always be wrong, would never, we

736
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:02,507
were told, get any better.

737
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:06,844
So we now have what you call
a slum lord essentially.

738
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:08,579
Snapping up large
numbers of buildings.

739
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,682
First of all, he takes out a

740
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:12,850
huge fire insurance policy.

741
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:17,188
So as he goes to the junkies and

742
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:20,358
says listen, you see that
apartment on the top floor?

743
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:22,260
I'm going to turn my back.

744
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,462
You take all of the lead pipes

745
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,297
that are in there, but I have

746
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:29,934
one request, please, before you

747
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:34,705
leave, turn on the
water, and the

748
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:38,643
they then hire an arsonist and

749
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:39,944
sets fire to the building, they

750
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,312
collect all the money,
and they leave.

751
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,313
I remember it well.

752
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,215
I remember those years.

753
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:47,152
Things were bad.

754
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:50,455
Are things boroughwide,
are they getting better?

755
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:52,290
Is the Bronx better?

756
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:52,591
Absolutely.

757
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:55,226
There is more home ownership in

758
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:56,627
the south Bronx than had
ever existed in history.

759
00:34:56,628 --> 00:35:00,131
That doesn't mean that
we've reached utopia.

760
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,867
How long it will take,
I'm a historian.

761
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:04,635
I look in the other direction.

762
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:10,074
I would say my crystal
ball is cracked.

763
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:12,243
I got four cheeseburgers.

764
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,645
Is it the best hamburger
in the world?

765
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:18,316
Far from it, my friends.

766
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:21,018
Is it even, strictly
speaking, a burger?

767
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,354
I mean, it's small and
square and steamed.

768
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,422
It can be, especially when you

769
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:26,324
eat a lot of them, as one tends

770
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:30,761
to, a hate yourself in
the morning experience.

771
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,197
But if you grew up with white

772
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:35,333
castle like I did and like

773
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,368
handsome dick Manitoba did, this

774
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:41,172
connects with some deep dinosaur

775
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:45,443
part of the brain, evoking
an emotional response.

776
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:47,178
This is a big part
of my childhood.

777
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:50,181
We'd come here 24 hours a day.

778
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:50,816
There were guys on their dates.

779
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,049
There was a bunch
of punk rock kids.

780
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,851
So along with that potpourri of

781
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,187
humanity I just described you

782
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,190
had these guys from the
mental institution.

783
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,391
Ah, that's community for you.

784
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,626
That was the Bronx.

785
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:04,229
That was the Bronx, man.

786
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,696
It was great.

787
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:06,397
Maybe you know handsome dick

788
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:10,235
from such prepunk legendary
bands as the dictators.

789
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:12,570
Dick grew up, where else, the

790
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:14,239
Athens, the cultural guyser, the

791
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,975
font of art and music
that is the Bronx.

792
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:19,310
And back in the day like me,

793
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:22,580
this was his special
warm and happy place.

794
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,715
I can go by and eat a full

795
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:29,420
2 1/2-hour meal, be stuffed, and

796
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,056
see someone eating a white
castle, I stilt want one.

797
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,225
You can forget Mickey D’s.

798
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:35,660
You forget burger king.

799
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,228
You fork all those places.

800
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:40,398
If you need a white castle
scratch, none of the cheap

801
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,732
places will do.

802
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,370
I can't stop eating.

803
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,003
The Bronx academy of letters

804
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:20,838
is something of a cause for me.

805
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,673
An institution whose mission I

806
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:25,042
see as absolutely vital.

807
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,811
If kids like these kids from a

808
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:28,346
tough neighborhood, often coming

809
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:31,181
from tough family situations,

810
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,017
are going to dot things that

811
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:34,652
they're capable of, of
having the things they want.

812
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,153
I believe that there is no way

813
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,523
to realize your dreams if you

814
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:39,690
can't articulate them, if you

815
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,359
can't with words convince others

816
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,060
to give you the opportunities,

817
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:46,664
the chances you need to grasp.

818
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:48,366
So I wanted to talk today...

819
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,701
Really I'm going to tell you
in a short period of time

820
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,070
everything I know about writing.

821
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,539
Today I'm dropping by in my

822
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,377
role as substitute teacher.

823
00:37:59,378 --> 00:37:59,878
I'm from Manhattan.

824
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:02,413
And I don't know anything
about the Bronx really.

825
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,615
I'm ridiculously,
shamefully ignorant.

826
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,384
Do you think people know about

827
00:38:05,385 --> 00:38:08,886
the Bronx, what it's like
to grow up in the Bronx?

828
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,721
Everybody perceives the Bronx

829
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,858
as the emergence of hip-hop
and all that, the culture.

830
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:17,227
But apart from that the Bronx is

831
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:17,829
actually lively at all times.

832
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,229
At night, in the morning.

833
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,568
You hear people screaming
from outside your window.

834
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:26,404
Since I was like 7.

835
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:29,740
And it's happened that way.

836
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:30,709
Community's the biggest thing.

837
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,909
I've been teaching here for

838
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,077
eight years, and I think that

839
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,244
what people forget is a lot of

840
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,446
times we talk about this in

841
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:38,749
class, they focus on lots of

842
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,318
diseases, health issues,
lack of education.

843
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,887
But I can be out with them just

844
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:44,254
walking to the train to go to a

845
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,792
field trip and they say
hi to at least 30 people.

846
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:50,595
They know everyone.

847
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:52,062
What other Bronx specialties

848
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,732
should I be paying attention to?

849
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:58,436
Montano's.

850
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:01,271
That works for you.

851
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,107
Yeah.

852
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:05,042
I like bacon, egg and
cheese sandwich.

853
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,276
That's a classic.

854
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:10,415
That's a New York classic.

855
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,782
Sort of a bodega classic.

856
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:12,317
Love that.

857
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:16,286
I walk outside and
have the Italian icee.

858
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,788
Soon as the weather gets nice

859
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:22,292
and you hear cohito,
they've got the best.

860
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,796
What is chopped cheese?

861
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,932
I have to see.

862
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,800
Where does this come from?

863
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,469
This mutant cheese.

864
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:37,975
This thing, whatever it
is, it'll do just fine.

865
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:41,979
As long as you're reading
Orwell's essays while you're

866
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,814
eating it, kid.

867
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:46,183
I think it's someone who
experiments in their home.

868
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,184
Because it tastes so different

869
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:48,653
than like a cheeseburger, which

870
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:51,321
is what it kind of is actually.

871
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,792
But it's... people uptown or

872
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:56,160
like downtown say chopped cheese

873
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,328
and they're like, what?

874
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,998
Here you're like...
So this is a regional

875
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:01,533
indigenous special.

876
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:03,501
And it's newer, too, right?

877
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:05,335
It hasn't been around that long.

878
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,336
I've been everywhere in the

879
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,672
world, and I mean just about

880
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,340
everywhere in the world
that you can think of.

881
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:14,645
As beautiful as many cities
around the world are, it's

882
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,647
really in your blood,
particularly if you grew up

883
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:17,015
here.

884
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:19,349
You're living in Paris, you

885
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,018
don't want a chopped
cheese sandwich.

886
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:29,019
You'll be angry you
that can't get one.

887
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:31,830
So there it is.

888
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:34,364
A peek, a narrow slice of an

889
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:38,002
old, deep, and noble subject.

890
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:41,205
♪ Causing the co-existence

00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,206

The great unknown.

897
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:55,252
Go look.

898
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,888
The X.

899
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,858
Armageddon.
