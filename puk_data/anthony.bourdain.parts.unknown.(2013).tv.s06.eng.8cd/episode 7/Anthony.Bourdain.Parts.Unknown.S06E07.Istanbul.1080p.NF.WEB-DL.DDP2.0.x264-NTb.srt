you make an accident?

364

say this is Esan's section.

506
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,009

whether it's for show or not,

508
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,559

512
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,739

513
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,283
Oh, no, it's populism.
It's a political base.

514

want to drink, et cetera,
