<i>Well, it's always useful when
asking those kinds of questions</i>

359
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,678
<i>wherever you are to ask, first,</i>

360
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,056
<i>who did the cooking back then in the beginning?</i>

361
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:46,184
<i>Where did they come from?</i>
When you meet people here,

362
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,312
you know that you're seeing a

363
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,981
direct descendant of a slave

364
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,984
that was here after the slaves were freed.

365
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:57,236
<i>Ashley Green grew up on
Mosquito Beach on James Island</i>

366
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,488
<i>in Charleston.</i>

367
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,032
<i>Her mother owns the property</i>

368
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,201
<i>which has been in her family for generations.</i>

369
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,621
<i>Fact of the matter is, in the
old South back when the dishes,</i>

370
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,499
<i>ingredients, flavors of Southern cooking,</i>

371
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,627
<i>which is to say American cooking
as opposed to European,</i>

372
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,672
<i>chances are that food was grown,</i>

373
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,719
<i>gathered, produced and prepared by African slaves.</i>

374
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,473
<i>Chef VJ Dennis has made it a
personal mission to celebrate</i>

375
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,935
<i>and protect the culinary

376
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,063
<i>down to him.</i>

377
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,148
This is some local blue crab.

378
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,858
Just freshly seasoned.

379
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,194
This is a play on some garlic crabs.

380
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:40,030
This is shrimp butter instead of the garlic butter.

381
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,741
You have the play of the French influence

382
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,493
into the cuisine right here.

383
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,788
<i>The flavors and textures and
food ways of West Africa</i>

384
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,832
<i>are all over Southern cooking.</i>

385
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,919
<i>And there are few better places
to see how short the line</i>

386
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,464
<i>between there and here than Gullah culture.</i>

387
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,217
I'm really enjoying this. I got to tell you.

388
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:01,593
This is so delicious.

389
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,428
Oh, my.

390
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,515
How African is traditional Gullah cooking?

391
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,851
I think what happens is you change the location

392
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,854
of the people but you did not
change who the people were.

393
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,191
You did not change the
information that they came with,

394
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,068
with their traditions.

395
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,987
If you look at the history of
American food, you'll quickly

396
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:26,869
see this is one of the first
true cuisines of America.

397
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,083
What's that? What is this? This looks good.

398
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,084
West Africa...

399
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,168
All right.

400
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,212
<i>Soft shell crabs and konk</i>

401
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,048

402

<i>with Carolina rice, sautéed squash, and zucchini.</i>

403
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,180
Oh, that's so good.

404
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:51,517
It's been a while since I've had konk.

405
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,519
Clearly, correct me if I'm wrong,

406
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,605
there's a different kind of
interest in Charleston than

407
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,690
existed 20 years ago.

408
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,025
Right?

409
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,819
Is something happening here?

410
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,528
What's changed?

411
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,617
It's good to have people, to
have a more diverse community in

412
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,995
a sense, but then you also lose a little bit.

413
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,497
The danger is they're coming to Charleston

414
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,499
because of the beauty,

415
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,170
and we're having to fight against bigger entities

416
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:21,547
that seek to get the land so they can develop it.

417
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:26,385
And so we're fighting to keep
what's been ours and so it's

418
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:30,974
important for us to preserve this area.

419
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:36,353
Preserve this culture for generations to come.

parody of itself?

<i>Modern, clean, advanced, complete meat processing.</i>

435
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:20,232
I think it's a combination of
two massive cultural influences

436
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,734
that came together at the same time.

437
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:28,447
The idea of industrialization
came late to the South.

438
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:32,744
When it hit, we got the first
nutrition laws in America were

439
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,289
written in South Carolina
because everybody moved into

440
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,209
mill villages and immediately
started eating processed food

441
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,295
because they weren't growing their food anymore.

442
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,216
The second thing that happened

443
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:50,845
is there was a massive amount of
expertise that was lost during

444
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,471
the Civil War.

445
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,849

<i>How come grits aren't as good as they used to be?</i>

Why do this? Why do something as unwanted?

452
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:18,164
Meaning nobody was particularly
crying, you know, we need rice

453
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,127

454
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,880
we need grits, better grits.

455
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,050
What called to you that you
felt compelled to answer?

456
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,719
I'm a cuisine whore.

457
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,975
You know, I think culture is
interactive with cuisine.

458
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,852
As soon as you look at cuisine,
you're looking at politics,

459
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,313
you're looking at medicine,

460
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,273
you're looking at the advanced thinking.

461
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,317
I'll agree with you, there's nothing more political

462
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,359
than food.

463
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,153

466
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,202
<i>Determined to source the kind of local products</i>

467
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,580
<i>you used to find everywhere in the low country.</i>

468
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,875
<i>As much as I'd like to
illustrate that solid grounding</i>

<i>in traditional ingredients and
preparations with my order,</i>

470
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,173
<i>I could not resist the soft shell crabs,</i>

471
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,715

476
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,726
Sweet.

477
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,105
When you had your first plate full of proper rice,

478
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,941
is there an instinct to
bludgeon the rest of the world

479
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,487
in an understanding of what
you'd just come to understand?

480
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:34,282
I did not run up and down
the streets of Charleston.

481
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,076
It was tough to dislodge people here,

482
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,662
so I just went straight to San Francisco.

483
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,830
Right.

484
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,874
I gave away tons of product.

485
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,669
And guess what, they went crazy.

486
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,300
<i>Slow baked black bass, ramps
in season, and lettuces.</i>

487
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,639
<i>And this to all things Glen is
responsible for bringing back.</i>

488
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,060
<i>Heirloom rice and pigs, suckling asabal pig</i>

489
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,688
<i>and Carolina gold rice.</i>

490
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,400
Isn't that great?

491
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,027
This is phenomenal. These peas are killer.

492
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,778
I'm hitting the rice next.

493
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,699
That's got the entire history
of Southern agriculture in it.

494
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,243
Right here.

495
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,827
Right there in that little bowl.

496
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:24,123
This whole idea of having a century in a dish,

497
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:28,127
none of this stuff was here 20 years ago.

498
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,213
<i>Near the end of the Civil War,</i>

499
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,757
<i>during General Sherman's scorched earth campaign,</i>

500
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,510
<i>seed stores were a favored target.</i>

501
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,930
<i>It was largely African slaves
who were able to save the seeds</i>

502
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:43,935
<i>that Glen is now able to locate and reintroduce.</i>

503
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:47,146
It is those people who kept the corn.

504
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,606
It is those people who kept the cow peas.

505
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,651
It's those people who kept the
vegetables because they couldn't

506
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,653
buy their way out of not doing it.

507
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:58,657
Will you talk about chitlins, pig foot, hog maws,

508
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,285
African Americans in the north do not

509
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,830
embrace those classics of the

510
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,918
South as an overlay of pain and
oppression that goes with it.

511
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,711
How do we combat that?

512
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,714
What you're speaking about is
walking away from your own

513
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,384
culinary heritage because of social sensitivity.

514
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,678
Bottom line is, if you want
something that's compelling,

515
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,518
that draws on your soul, this
is why they call it soul food.

516
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:32,275
I need the finest in turkey-killing couture.

517
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,693
I want to be ninja-like and I want to look cool.

518
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:40,158
Camouflage is the standard go out
wearing South Carolina, so...

519
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,787
I'm bringing that look to New York.

520
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,205
<i>The cool, clear morning</i>

521
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,707

<i>would do on a day like this,</i>

523
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,253
<i>look for turkeys to kill.</i>

524
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,338
Pants, need those.

525
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,632
All right.

526
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:59,927
You know, in South Carolina, our
state bird is the mosquito.

527
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,096
Right. So I want to be covered head to toe.

528
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,184
We need your face covered up.

529
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:10,813
Going to the waffle house wearing this.

530
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,732
This is totally me.

576
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,526
12.

577
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,903
Yeah, in a town like this, that's pretty amazing.

578
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,656

579

580
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,702
This is really moist for a wild turkey.

581
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,788

like turkey need to eat this.

What's your impression of Charleston?

583

It's one of those weird
distinctly American mutations

584
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,255
kind of like rock 'n' roll or jazz or blues.

585
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,424
That's what makes Charleston so
cool, though, there's really

586
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,384
nothing else like it in America

587
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,219
and it's been unique since the

588
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,680
early part of the 18th century

589
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,182
and the city works hard to preserve that.

590
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,101
We have an incredibly gorgeous
city that people want

591
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,604
to visit. So we have the advantage of tourism.

592
00:30:56,605 --> 00:31:00,191
The clientele definitely gives
us the opportunity to be

593
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,485
this progressive or...

594
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,611
Almost push us to be more

595
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,070
than we can even be.

596
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,072
We have an active cuisine.

597
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,866
We've recovered all these

598
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,036
ingredients and rediscovered
a lot of the agricultural

599
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:16,666
influences that were destroyed
in the 20th century, but we're

600
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,251
not just recreating history.

601
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,629
We're not going back and cooking the Civil War.

602
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,423
These guys are pushing the food
forward here and we're creating

603

Got to be a happy day when you

605

We're one of the last few hunters in the world.

606
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,993
There's no store for us to go offshore

607
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,079
to go and pick those fish up.

608
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,455
We have to look for them. We have to go and sort of

609
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,957
find the ones we're allowed to harvest.

610
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,545
We're the last of the final
frontier of hunters, you know,

611
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,965

709
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,430
Got to have a little bit of white rib with it.

710
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,474
Yeah.

711
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:28,519
This is what everybody always
gets wrong in New York.

712
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,313
You serve cornbread with
barbecue, which, of course,

713
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,898
falls into crumbles.

714
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,485
You got to have that. Look at that.

715
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,323
This is what we call pork spaghetti.

716
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,660
Got to have some of that.

717
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,246
Man, that sauce is nice, too.

718
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,790
Perfect. Right?

719
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,167
Red pepper.

720
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,960
That's my dad's recipe.

721
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,672
You do not the standard South
Carolina mustard dressing

722
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,298
at all?

723
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,591
Pissed at me about this because

724
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,593
people feel strongly about these things.

725
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,262
I was not liking that mustard thing.

726
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,348
Around here you scream mustard, they'll think it's

727
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,850
going on a hot dog.

728
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,226
That's the only thing they know about mustard here.

729
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,477
Oh, good.

730
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,771
Oh, man, that's just so good.

731
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,983
How many hours, about, that pig is cooking?

732
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,693
12 hours. About 12.

733
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:18,986
You have to love it.

734
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,445
You have to be head over heels

735
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,280
in love with it to do that every day.

736
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,824
I mean, do you ever get sick of eating barbecue?

737
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,326
No, not yet.

738
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,667
What are we fishing for here?

739
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:38,797
Well, out here we got spot tail
bass, flounder, sea trout.

740
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,383
Really? -Yeah.

741
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,970
I got you.

742
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,767
The way you fish here, throw
it out as far as you can and

743
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,476
just leave it.

744
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,311
Just leave it?

745
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,231
That's the cool thing about fishing out here.

746
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:59,317
I don't have to be working,
not much skill involved.

747
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:04,281
So how am I doing in learning
to be a red neck department?

748
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,449
Not wearing shoes.

749
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,159
You're looking good.

750
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,454
Without shoes on, a fishing
pole in your hand on a dock.

751
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,540
That's pretty awesome.

752
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,259
That's a different pace here, man.

753
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,636
You know, this is the way to live.

754
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,512
I enjoy it.

755
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,680
