49
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,608
It's not self-consciously diving,

50
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,487

00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,764
Those are rarer and rarer.

58
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,894
- Is the relentless wheel of history going to roll

59
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:49,687

Yeah. They want to build a fancy ferry terminal.

Young people coming here in the tech industry

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,129

76
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,489
Right.

77
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,574

I'm like a Real Housewife of New York City,

157
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,364

00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,392
I should eat these before training.

179
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,103
Gives me super human strength.

180
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,854
On the other hand, coughing up oysters all

181
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,775
over the front of my gi might not be cool.

182
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,996
<i>The Bay Area is changing forever.</i>

183
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,959
<i>Will San Francisco's new
overlords find place in their</i>

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,796
<i>hearts for this?</i>

185
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,425
<i>Trader Vick's.</i>

186
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,926
<i>One of the last of its kind.</i>

187
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,471
<i>Started in Oakland, a wave of</i>

188
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,306
<i>tiki themed Polynesian fancy</i>

189
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:45,144
<i>restaurants and bar clubs for
a time spread across America.</i>

190
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,812
I definitely need the drinks menu.

191
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:51,358
I've been beaten like a chicken fried steak.

192
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,736
You were doing some sort of martial art, too.

193
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,822
I want the mai tai wave?

194
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,864
What's the mai tai wave?

195
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,158
It's a flight of mai tais.

196
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,951
Really?

197
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,702
It's a surfboard with three different mai tais.

198
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,623
<i>Not many places left that do this.</i>

199
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,084
<i>Very few do it, without irony.</i>

200
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,628
This is not the first time you have been here?

201
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,421
No, I practically grew up in this place.

202
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,797
Really?

203
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,882
My parents used to take me from like age 3.

204
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,512
It was like a home at Trader Vic's.

205
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,389
<i>Author Shawn Wilsey, grew up San Francisco.</i>

206
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,143
<i>His parents were regulars at
the original downtown Vic's.</i>

207
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,770
<i>I used to drop acid and go to Hawaii Kai,</i>

208
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,983
<i>so this kind of thing is a
taste of my childhood, too.</i>

209
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,194
Oh, yeah.

210
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,572
I got sent to boarding school
when I was a teenager.

211
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,906
East Coast boarding school,

212
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,284
everybody's like, you're from the Gay Bay.

213
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,995
It was really difficult to

214
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,039
negotiate being from San Francisco.

215
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,668
I would lie and say I was from
Napa because I was embarrassed.

216
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,127
Really?

217
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,673
I was at like a hockey school in Massachusetts.

218
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:59,343
I was going to get hazed for
being from San Francisco.

219
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,845
So San Francisco for you as a kid was...

220
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,598
I remember all sorts of factions,

221
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,059
like skinheads and skaters,

222
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,269
from the teenager's point of view,

223
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,898
and hippies and slightly older beatniks.

224
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,732
Everything was cheap.

225
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,777
I don't think San Francisco
became an expensive rental town

226
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,032
until maybe the last 10 years.

227
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,832
<i>I love this Pan Pacific...</i>

228
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,087
They have a weird Tandori-Japanese-Chinese oven.

229
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,256
Right.

230
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,433
It's really good.

231
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,475
It's really good.

232
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,435
Do you want that rib?

233
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,477
No.

234
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,563
I'm taking it.

235
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:58,277
The narrative is evil techies
are coming in and pushing out

236
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,363
the mom and pop restaurants.

237
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,450
That's a true thing.

238
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:08,912
People everyone hates is Google
now, Google and Twitter?

239
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,831
They're really hated, only by certain people.

240
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,960
Outside San Francisco they're like heroes,

241
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,253
they changed the world.

242
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,379
Yeah!

243
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,422
We like them fine.

244
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,716
I google things.

245
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,552
Legitimate.

246
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:24,802
I google things, too.

247
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,555
I do. It happens, right?

248
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,640
Look...

249
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,890
Excuse me.

250
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,768
Google, they have their own buses,

251
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,646
which is apparently a bone
of contention for people?

252
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,732
It is. Well, the buses...

253
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,443
Apparently if you work at Google or Twitter,

254
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,863
lunch is freshly made frittatas.

255
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,617
Italian housewife making...

256
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,201
Someone making kale smoothies.

257
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,203
I don't have any problem with it at all.

258
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,331
I don't really either.

259
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,916
I don't have a problem with that stuff at all.

260
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,920
I think the only point about
like the way the city is

261
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,257
changing is, you know, just what was cool about it?

262
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,135
The city has a personality.

263
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:09,014
It feels like a seedy old-school
American city, you know.

264
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,601
Do you want it to be the same everywhere you go?

265
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,938
The San Francisco right now is a pretty nice city.

266
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:33,539
<i>It took me six months to be
able to handle the warm-ups</i>

267
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,415
<i>back at my home academy.</i>

268
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,960
<i>For a long time after I just
prayed somebody would be more</i>

269
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,129
<i>out of shape than me.</i>

270
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,508
<i>The warm-ups at house are legendarily tough.</i>

271
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,843
<i>They're proud of it, lasting in</i>

272
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,969
<i>some classes, they say, a half</i>

273
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,180
<i>hour and beyond, a ferocious</i>

274
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,351
<i>unrelenting interval training.</i>

275
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,786
You go a block over, you're at Alamo Square,

276
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,997
that's where the<i> Full House</i> are.

277
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,457
It's super high-end real estate.

278
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,335
But... five years ago, it there was

279
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,881
like the hood and changed a lot.

280
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,174
This is 4505 meats.

281
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,302
They started off... Ryan would be
on the street, outside a bar,

282
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,848
with a Weber grill and built up

283
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,850
the business as the reputation

284
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,685
best hamburger in the city and

285
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,936
then he opened up this place.

286
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,606
It's really good.

287
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,117
Wow.

288
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,578
It's a little of everything,
our presidential platter,

289
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,830
jalapeño and cheddar sausage.

290
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,333
Our frank-a-ronis on top of a hot dog.

291
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,378
Oh, that's wrong. I want it.

292
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:09,175
Ribs, brisket, chicken, the
hog we were cooking earlier.

293
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,261
Beans, potato salad and coleslaw.

294
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,097
Very very good. Thank you.

295
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,058
Thanks, man. Wow.

296
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,937
How long have you been in the
restaurant business total?

297
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,647
17 years now.

298
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:26,944
You have become reluctantly, I'm
sure, sort of the poster boy

299
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,028
for the beleaguered victimized

300
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,449
by tech money, what's happening

301
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,075
in San Francisco as a whole?

302
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,994
Yeah, there's definitely good guys and bad guys

303
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,246
and lots of people that came
in now who haven't paid any

304
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,207
dues can open something right away,

305
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,419
drop $4 million in it or something.

306
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,589
<i>Over the course of five years, Richie built his</i>

307
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,969
<i>restaurant Hop-a-ramen into
a beloved local favorite.</i>

308
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,305
<i>Then he made a deal to open a brick and mortar Hop.</i>

309
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:59,142
<i>With that money came expectations and only four</i>

310
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,979
<i>months in the shit hit the</i> fan.

311
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,522
If you're going to open a restaurant,

312
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,815
you're not going to make money.

313
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,024
And that's when the trouble started.

314
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,277
Who makes money in a year?

315
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,238
30 days we were facing those sorts of things.

316
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,910
<i>The money wanted to make some
changes, Richie did not.</i>

317
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,996
<i>So he left.</i>

318
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,373
<i>The restaurant he created vaporized with him.</i>

319
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,125
At the old space we operated out of,

320
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,252
they're doing a vegan brunch there now.

321
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,921
No way.

322
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,924
It really is the perfect story
of evil triumphs over good.

323
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,927
The problem is there is a lot

324
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,762
of people have the means to open

325
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,890
a restaurant and sort of open

326
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,476
formula restaurant, safe.

327
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,854
Any interesting food will get

328
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,899
forced out and be a town full of

329
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,860
Chipotles.

330
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,001
Thank you.

331
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,127
You're welcome.

332
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,387
<i>Now, when you're a white belt,
especially a 59-year-old</i>

333
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,847
<i>white belt facing younger,</i>

334
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,933
<i>stronger, far better competitors,</i>

00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:27,981
<i>you go out there to learn how to survive.</i>

337
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,526
<i>If I can hold on, break their

338
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,445

00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,407
<i>they choke me out and I have to tap.</i>

340
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,795
<i>The changes are not just
happening in San Francisco,</i>

341
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,337

<i>would think a starker history of resistance.</i>

<i>This after all is where the

345
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,519
<i>Bobby Seale was a founder of the Black Panthers,</i>

346
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,564

<i>And here at Miss Ollie's, you</i> get a taste of

<i>the shiny new Oakland.</i>

349
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,614
The black panther is a type of
animal, if you push it into a

350
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,366
corner it will try to move out of your way.

351
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,619
If you keep pushing it, sooner
or later it will come out of

352
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,703
that corner.

353
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,999
Said, that's like black people.

354
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,043
We came up with the Black Panther party and take a

355
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,088
position of self-defense.

356
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:40,929
<i>The Panthers were viewed by the
FBI as public enemy number 1.</i>

357
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,223
<i>They sold the Panthers as the enemy, using your own</i>

358
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:48,311
<i>imagery, strong black men holding weapons.</i>

359
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,774
<i>What Nixon saw as the real
threat from the Panthers...</i>

360
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:56,903
Popularity, with the killing of Martin Luther King,

361
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,656
my organization spread across the country.

362
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,868
It went beyond the Black Panther party.

363
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,538
<i>The Panther's aims were, by
today's standards, shockingly</i>

364
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,500
<i>moderate, equality in housing,
education, employment</i>

365
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,085
<i>and basic civil rights.</i>

366
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,129
<i>But the image of black men with guns</i>

367
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,424
<i>was too much for the America of 1966.</i>

368
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:23,388
Right after Nixon was sworn
in, I got the Watergate tape.

369
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,559
"J. Edgar, you've got to get
rid of those Black Panthers."

370
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,228
"What are you doing? How have you been doing this?"

371
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,064
"I want you to move and get
rid of the Black Panthers."

372
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:36,735
The man's just been sworn, the
president of the United States.

373
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,444
<i>Raids are launched on Panthers strong points</i>

374
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,823
<i>around the country, arrests are many.</i>

375
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,534
<i>The FBI did everything they</i>

376
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,243
<i>could to eradicate them.</i>

377
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,349
<i>The Panthers say the</i>

378
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,453
<i>police have broken in</i>

379
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:51,457
<i>and killed one man at close range as he slept.</i>

380
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,086
The dismantling of the Panthers was brutal,

381
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,505
everybody believes an assassination campaign

382
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,843
coupled with murder and arrests.

383
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,930
We had no charges, nothing,

384
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,891
they created, through their
counter-intelligence program

385
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,436
everything that happened to us.

386
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,022
Are you happy with the level of black activism

387
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,774
in the country now?

388
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,277
I like the level of activism.

389
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,156
And black lives matter movement
is very very important because

390
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,867
there's a bunch of young, intelligent youth

391
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,368
running this operation.

392
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,829
Do you think the good guys are winning?

393
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,539
What?

394
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,832
You look at it the way the
country is running, do you think

395
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,375
the good guys are winning?

396
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:39,172
The bad guys, the Koch brothers, Tea Party and all

397
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:43,468
these right wing idiots are so far winning.

398
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,805
Young people have got to go
out there and be progressive

399
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:51,684
enough not only to end police
brutality but create frameworks

400
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,895
and demanding no.

401
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,857
These are the kinds of things that has to happen.

402
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,171
Curry and cauliflower, it's Indian-Chinese,

403
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:23,466
like General's Chicken made with vegetables.

404
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,052
It's one of our most popular
dishes, vegetable candy.

405
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,430
<i>Juhu Beach Club, in a strip

<i>neighborhood, an unassuming
but delicious new addition</i>

407
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:36,353
<i>started by this woman Preeti Mistry.</i>

408
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,065
Ah, so good.

409
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,484
I know you've been to India several times.

410
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,779
Maybe you had the puffed rice?

411
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,281
Yes, yes.

412
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:51,953
We're in Oakland and we serve it in a ball jar.

413
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:56,082
Tamarind, chutney, cilantro
chutney, pickled cabbage,

414
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,294
pickled onions, fresh green garbanzo beans,

415
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,174
puffed rice and chickpea noodles.

416
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,976
Oakland now, in terms of like artists and chefs

417
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,521
has basically, kids have been
priced out of San Francisco.

418
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,900
It's still possible for a place
like this basically funded

419
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,986
by Preeti and her wife, to open up.

420
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,612
In San Francisco,

421
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,447
I don't think it's really
possible anymore to do that.

422
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,908
You need big investors.

423
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,868
You need lots of funding.

424
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,080
<i>The food is both familiar and uniquely her own.</i>

425
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,374
Chili paneer is one of my favorites.

426
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:41,920
It has bok choy, and other items,

427
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,924
none of which would traditionally be in it.

428
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,594
Does authenticity have any meaning or relevance

429
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,970
anymore at all?

430
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,098
I would say our food is not traditional.

431
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,473
Is it authentic? Hell, yeah,

432
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,268
100% authentic.

433
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:01,731
Saying it's not authentic is a
person of Indian origin in the

434
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,275
United States is not authentic.

435
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,778
I grew up eating Indian food
and pizza and hamburgers

436
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,948
at the same time.

437
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,242
So tasty.

438
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,868
Something we struggle with in New York

439
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:18,415
is how do you value Indian food?

440
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,999
Yeah, totally.

441
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,253
The expectation is you get
authentic Indian food cheap.

442
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,130
Super cheap.

443
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,547
Our food is not cheap.

444
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,427
At Yelp review, it is said we are overpriced.

445
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,262
$19 for a curry.

446
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:36,516
Do you know how to make a curry?

447
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,561
<i>Yogurt marinated chicken simmered</i>

448
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,564

00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,317
<i>and garam masala.</i>

450
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:48,403
All right!

451
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,447
This is our chicken curry,

452
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,949
braised on the bone.

453
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,618
Butter, fresh red peppers in there.

454
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,787
That's totally delicious.

455
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:01,124
This guy right here, you want to cut it open.

456
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:05,044
Get the camera in over, right here.

457
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,339
Prepare the incision.

458
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,215
Whoa!

459
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,593
Some people say its an Indian scotch egg.

460
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:17,140
We invented the scotch egg, they didn't.

461
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,434
We took a duck egg, cooked it,

462
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,644
kept it soft, wrapped it in lamb

463
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:26,275
and the sauce has braised leg of lamb in it.

464
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,069
Wow.

465
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,655
Really extraordinarily delicious.

466
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,492
So, this is a positive thing.

467
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,576
Yeah. I think this is positive.

468
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,329
A change we like?

469
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,788
This is kind of change we like.

470
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,540
I believe any place that serves delicious food

471
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,918
is on the side of the angels.

472
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,425
Extend your arm.

473
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,843
Your other arm.

474
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,390
The other arm is anchored wrong, like this.

475
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:01,453
Did you see the vacant lot across the street?

476
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:06,707
That was San Jose Chinatown built in 1887.

477
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,792
That was first.

478
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,043
That was first.

479
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,002
A Chinese community first.

480
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,879
Right.

481
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,384
1890 was when some of the first
Japanese arrived in this area.

482
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,137
<i>South Bay San Jose, not much</i>

483
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,222
<i>going on out here other than</i>

484
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,515
<i>world domination by a small</i>

485
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,267
<i>group of tech companies.</i>

486
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,727
<i>On a happier less paranoid note,</i>

487
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,231
<i>San Jose has one of the last</i>
three Japantowns in the

488
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,941
<i>country.</i>

489
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,859
Who were the first Japanese to come over?

490
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,905
Students, laborers looking for a better life.

491
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,491
In traditional Japanese families

492
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,785
the first son inherited everything.

493
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,954
Generally, it was the second son

494
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,541
who would get nothing who came over.

495
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:52,086
When the first Japanese came
here, one of the places they

496
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,213
stayed at was Chinatown.

497
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,508
You would have an Asian community.

498
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:00,845
They would be able to find
food similar to Japanese food

499
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,556
and there'd be a comrade.

500
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,476
Thank you.

501
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,978
<i>Curt Fukuda grew up in the area.</i>

502
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,980
<i>His family, like thousands of</i>

503
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,773
<i>other Japanese Americans, were</i>

504
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:16,277
<i>interned in camps in World War II.</i>

505
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,404
In the beginning of the 20th
Century there was a lot of

506
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,365
anti-Asian prejudice.

507
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,660
Too many taking our jobs.

508
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,411
Some of them were buying our land.

509
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:30,249
Things got really bad for
Japanese after Pearl Harbor.

510
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,003
It was an internment program.

511
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,548
So they had a list of all the names.

512
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,174
Kids, too.

513
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,302
Children, too, they all had
to go walking to the train

514
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,763
station in downtown San Jose.

515
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,058
My mother did say in the

516
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,142
beginning before they were

517
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,268
brought to the camps they were

518
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,687
brought to assembly centers

519
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,523
while the camps were being built.

520
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:58,695
It was the racetrack at Santa
Anita and said they were

521
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,531
actually sleeping in horse stalls.

522
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,449
What happened to their property?

523
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,078
Some of the people found
Caucasian friends to look over

524
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,539
the property while they were gone.

525
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,751
Some of the Japanese actually dug
holes and buried possessions

526
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,587
hoping if they come back...

527
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,713
They can dig it up.

528
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:18,715
They can dig it up. Yes.

529
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,092
Oh, wow.

530
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,011
That brown gravy, awesome.

531
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,513
It's sort of a hybrid of

532
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,848
American dishes but with

533
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,767
Japanese ingredients.

534
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,185
Yes.

535
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,564
This is your typical Japantown restaurant food.

536
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:35,648
I think some of the

537
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,899
heartbreak of the internment,

538
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,238
this was really pure Americana.

539
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:46,117
The faces were Asian but the
businesses and feel was

540
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,076
Mayberry.

541
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,370
Right.

542
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,830
This was a Japanese-American community

543
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:56,210
with emphasis on American.

544
00:29:56,211 --> 00:30:00,214
The Japanese are actually a
minority in this community now.

545
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,593
How Japanese will it be in 30 years?

546
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:06,137
Ah, that is the question.

547
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,139
I don't think it's good for

548
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,434
anything to just kind of remain frozen in time.

549
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,394
30 years from now, Japantown is

550
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,895
going to look very different.

551
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,272
If it looks like it does right

552
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,566
now then, you know, we're

553
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:22,571
talking about a very stagnant community.

554
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,727
You've been in the restaurant business now in the

555
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:55,853
San Francisco area how many years?

556
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,438
26.

557
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,692
Basically you've been feeding well-heeled people

558
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,276
much of that time.

559
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,528
My whole life.

560
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,070

567
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,091
What are you up to now?

568
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:30,763
We're starting a fast-food venue.

569
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,264
Why?

570
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,974
It's unbelievable.

571
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,351
Because in our country, there's

572
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:39,230
so much of it it's okay for

573
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,274
people to eat garbage basically, processed food.

574
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:47,154
The tenderloin, the worst intersection,

575
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,241
most drug arrests and homicides, the most

577
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,622
being fed the worst food consistently.

Then scallion relish, grilled scallions and lime.

583
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:20,187
Veggie burger dressed exactly
the same way, if you're like I

584
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,065
am, the word veggie burger will
strike terror in your heart.

585
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,192
Yeah. It makes me violent, actually.

586
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,152
This will not make you violent.

587
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,739
It will make you happy.

588
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,620
Wow. I'd totally eat that.

589
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,163
If you didn't call it a veggie
burger, I'd be all over this.

590
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,248
Yeah.

591
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,083
So fast, healthy and affordable.

592
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,168
Yeah, 2 to $6.

593
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,254
So you're not going to get rich off this venture?

594
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,505
We'll make money.

595
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,299
You will make money? We have to.

596
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,928
Just because something hasn't
been done doesn't mean it can't.

this guy's collar and he broke

601
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,702
my rib this way and my finger went here.

602
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:21,039
I'm pretty sure Curt hasn't eaten at Coi before.

603
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,169
My finger broke against my 16
ounce glove against my head.

604
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,713
That's how hard this guy punched.

605
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,884
Not everybody likes to get
punched in the face really hard.

606

Thank you.

609
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,986
Well, it's pretty.

610
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:53,280
Oh, it's going to be good.

611
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,908
Mm. Oh, this is great.

612
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,078
Watch the barbarian eat really fancy food.

613
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,295
Oh, that looks good.

614
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,672
Yeah.

615
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,382
Egg yolk poached in smoked oil,

616

chives, California sturgeon caviar.

617
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,554
The egg yolk, it's fully cooked.

618
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,347
It's custard tasting.

619
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,807
A beautiful thing. Thank you.

620
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,893
I will love this.

621
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,687
Oh, yeah.

622
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,773
Man, I could eat more of those.

623
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,941
That was really good.

624
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:32,152
Why is there only one?

625
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,321
Born and bred in the San Francisco area?

626
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,364
Yes.

627
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,908
Jiu-jitsu for how long?

628
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,828
Since '93, since before the first UFC.

629
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,539
What was the preeminent martial art at the time?

630
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,666
I think it was karate.

631
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,209
Right?

632
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,753
Chuck Norris was big then,

633
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:53,550
right, kick people in the head kind of thing.

634
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,059
Cherry tomatoes and the sauce underneath is

635
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,938
grilled zucchini and wheat
grass, herbs and flowers on top.

Everything I grew myself in my house.

637
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,734
That is killer.

638
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,527
Excellent.

639
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,029
Do you eat carbs?

640
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,405
I mean generally speaking?

641
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,990
You eat whatever?

642
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,491
I can eat whatever.

643
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,744
My guys are all trying the all bacon,

644
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,038
and all bacon all of the time.

645
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,664
Yeah, that cannot be good for you.

646
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,666
No.

647
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,881
Miss, so sorry.

648
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:38,010
That is okay.

649
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,013

It looks great.

668
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,614
Most of the people we talk to on
the show are complaining that

00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,700
San Francisco is becoming too clean,

670
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,411
real San Franciscans can't
afford to live here anymore.

671
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,999
And they are being supplanted by
rich techies who are crushing

672
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,294

of what made San Francisco...

673
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,047
You are not seeing that?

674
00:36:56,048 --> 00:37:00,009
I think that the pushing out of the...

675

trash, sorry, is good.

676
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,141

00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:14,893
<i>making a big pot of feijoada,
the country's national dish.</i>

713
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,353
Dude.

714
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,313
Oh, man.

715
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,314
Look at that.

716
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,898
Oh, yeah.

717
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,567
<i>A slow cooked stew of beans and pig parts.</i>

718
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,237
I grew up eating every piece of the animal there is

719
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,530
because if you are starving, you

720
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,034
will eat whatever there is at the table.

721
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:35,747
<i>Plus grilled chicken hearts tri-tip and sausages.</i>

722
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,415
<i>Gotta have sausages.</i>

723
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,877
Do you like it like that, raw-ish?

724
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,170
Love it. Me, too.

725
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,880
I don't like overcooked meat.

726
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,716
No, that's just wrong.

727
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,886
Food is ready!

728
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:49,928
There you go, bro.

729
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,722
Oh, wow.

730
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,724
You want to open that Macallan?

731
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,059
Hell no.

732
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,102
I have class tomorrow, and you kidding me?

733
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,729
I'll drink that whole bottle

734
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,897
and train with everybody.

735
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,649
You are the guy that still trains.

736
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,653
As soon as I started doing Jiu-jitsu,

737
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,324
it hit a part of my psyche that, OK, it's

738
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:14,286
challenging and more than brute force

739
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,747
and you have to think.

740
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,084
I was the guy if you were
the old lady that hired me

741
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,336
to shovel the walk, I would do half of it

742
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:26,215
and realize that it is too hard and just disappear.

743
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:30,302
I cannot think of another thing
that I attacked with such

744
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:35,140
regularity and with such... I

745
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,017
mean, I have been steadfast.

746
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,104
It is not a matter of if you're good enough.

747
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,732
Sometimes, it has to deal with maturity.

748
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:50,239
<i>The old tends to get run over by the new.</i>

749
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,698
<i>That is how it works.</i>

750
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,908
<i>Whether it is San Francisco</i>

751
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,534
<i>invaded by a new generation of</i>

752
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,745
<i>people with different priorities,</i>

753
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,789
<i>or a 59-year-old man grappling</i>

754
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,916
<i>with a bunch of younger and</i>

755
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:04,753
<i>tougher and hungrier bastards.</i>

756
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:05,963
<i>But I don't know.</i>

757
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,672
<i>I like to think that there is a</i>

758
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,966
<i>hope, at a least hope that every</i>

759
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,051
<i>once in a while, the old guys</i>

760
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,886
<i>will have a good day.</i>

761
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,806
♪

762
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42,833
Oh, my God.

763
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:43,835
That was beautiful.
