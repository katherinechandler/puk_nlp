I have a block of cheese in my colon the size of a grapefruit.
Tony, come on.
Don't be grumpy.
Son of a bitch.
Jesus.
Sometimes I don't understand you.
I'm so hung over; I just want to crawl under the bushes and die.
- Seriously?
- No, I hate this.
Are we there yet?
No, the chalet's, maybe like,
I don't know, half hour?
- Okay.
- Ugh.
- It's amazing.
- Worst episode ever.

The French Alps, lovely Italians on one side, but the terrifying Swiss on the other.
They're close.
Too close for me.
A man with a neurotic childhood fear of alpine vistas, yodeling, even cheese with holes in it.
But my friend
Eric requires payback.
I have, in recent adventures with him, been unkind.
He grew up in mountains like this.
He's an expert skier.
This is like home to him, so I thought it was only fair he get a chance at payback.
I am not a graceful skier, but I am an enthusiastic one, and that's what you come here for in winter and early spring.
Some of the best slopes on Earth.
Also cheese, apparently.
Lots of cheese.
I just take your size.
Yes.
Okay.
Bend your knees, push on the foot.
They decent?
Yeah, they feel good.
That feels good.
- Good?
- Yeah.
You learned to ski in what, the Pyrenees, right?
- Yeah.
- I learned to ski in New Jersey.
Eh, it's the same.
Yes.
Well, that's what I always said.
You thought you were going to the Moon, or what?
Hey warm feet are important.
Nothing's more demoralizing than cold, wet feet.
You'll be bitching in those things; yeah, you'll...
- No, man.
- You'll look... you'll look cool.
That's gonna be...
These are gonna be like sponges.
- You wish me bad luck.
- No, I don't.
I just think you should have proper footwear, man.
Prior preparation prevents piss-poor performance.
Ski log, day one.
Conditions are not ideal.
It's thick powder and zero visibility.
Plus, I haven't skied in years, so it hurts... bad.
But God bless the French, they can't go too long, not even down a mountain, without eating well.
I gotta tell you,
I'm not impressed with my performance on that hill; I was dying.
Today's challenging.
I mean, look.
It... it's about 3 feet of fresh snow.
The visibility was okay, barely okay.
A year ago, at this time,
I was a killing machine.
Now, I was like...
I was seeing stars,
I mean, I, I...
No, it was the altitude.
And some extravagant, fantastic, uh, red wine.
We blow up the budget?
Kill 'em.
- Kill it?
- Kill 'em.
Okay, okay, all done.
Definitely the '66 Latour.
How much is it?
Is it... is it expensive enough?
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- They're gonna love you.
- We deserve it.
- Oh, it's good.
- Right, this is good, huh?
Well worth the expense to someone else.
This is the bigger name.
We're gonna have a week of good food, good wine, some ski, right?
So, what, what are the specialite ...of the region?
So, they do the raclettes.
- Cheese.
- You know like, yeah, cheese,
- Right.
- The fondue.
- That's cheese.
- Da dufflets.
- That's cheese.
- Yep.
I don't know.
- That's not bad; I like cheese.
- Yeah, I like stews.
They make a lot of stews too.
Yeah, of what animals?
Mostly beef.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- A lot of cows up here?
- Yeah.
I like cows... to eat.
Yeah, to eat, of course.
Don't much like 'em personally.
Where I learned to ski, we were lucky to get lukewarm chicken fingers and a Bud Light at the lodge.
Here, we start with pan-seared foie gras.
Wow.
- That's fancy, huh?
- All right.
I mean, why don't you eat that on the ski slope? Seriously.
For the main, a loin of veal, gently seared and pan-roasted.
Joined by a wild mushroom sauce, and a pretty little medley of vegetables.
- Whoa.
- Looking good.
Hoo-hoo.
How is it?
It's really good.
It's also... I wanted you to know this... humanely raised veal, free-range, died in its sleep.
I disagree with that, but I will eat it.
Just trying to make you feel better about the world.
I'm all over the cheese course like a one-man army.
Tomme de chevre, tomme de savoie et piment, fromage de chevre et creme de ren.
That's from, like, a cow.
Everybody has blood on their hands, Eric, everybody.
- I do too.
- Right, we all do.
- I do too.
- The clothes we wear, the air we breathe.
Everything we do is built on the backs of suffering people and dying animals.
I agree.
We wallow in blood.
Ski log, day two.
Yesterday, Chef Ripert showed no mercy on the mountain.
Today, conditions are more to my liking.
A small wager might have been made.
Loser might have to eat at Johnny Rockets.
Today it is on.
Ready?
Yeah.
One, two, three.
The title for your biography, for your bio pic:
"32 Yolks: The Revenge," or whatever we're calling it.
"64 Yolks," or "For a Few Yolks More."
Well, that'll be the sequel.
"A Fistfull of Yolks."
Okay, that's what we'll call it.
We have to change it to a more manly title.
- It's... it's...
- "32 Yolks" is...
Now it's becoming your book.
You're changing it; you're...
Welcome to Hollywood, my friend.
The Cremery.
A special place at the bottom of the mountain.
Croute with morilles, and cream, lots of cream.
I didn't expect that; that's really good.
Yeah.
We're eating bread and mushrooms...
- Right.
- Cheese.
There's no meat in this.
No, there's no meat.
I'm, like, practically like Gandhi at this point.
I'm not drastic.
I'm not saying, "Don't eat meat, become a vegan."
I'm saying, "Let's eat less meat."
You just think it's better for the planet?
It's good for the planet; it's good for our bodies.
I'll... I'll stand outside the Bourdeau Dan.
I'll tell all your customers that.
"You know, this fish thing, you should really, you should eat some vegetables."
Bovine flatulence is a major source of carbon dioxide.
Yes. It's the biggest one in the world.
No, not the biggest one in the world.
- Yes.
- Bovine flatulence?
Yes, bigger than cars, bigger than anything else.
See, this is why we should eat meat.
We're saving the planet; we're gonna kill these things.
We're ripping a hole in the ozone layer.
Plus, it stinks.
You are a lost... lost case.
What does she want?
She said she hopes you're very hungry, because...
Uh-oh.
What's coming is serious.
Farcante.
I think that means "cannonball of goodness" in French, because it's a big, heavy, albeit yet thoroughly delicious loaf of potato, bacon, dried fruit, and cream slowly steamed in a bain-marie.
This meal is a foreshadowing of the kind of light spa food that will become a regular feature of our time in the Alps.
- Whoa.
- Whoa.
We have to finish that.
It's like a...
It's like a volcano.
Look at this.
You can put the dried apricots or plums as well.
So, it's a bit sweet and salty.
It's...
It's very good.
It's really good.
You put that on a "Man versus
Food," food wins.
Can Eric Ripert eat the entire farcante in one hour?
If you can save the world, could you eat that?
No, if you could save a puppy, could you eat that?
- To save a puppy? Yeah.
- The whole thing.
You'd eat the whole thing to save a puppy?
Yeah.
Get me a puppy.
Ah, nature, the rustic charms of the farm, proximity to one's ingredients, the smell of fresh grass, manure, livestock.
I love it.
No, actually, that's Eric.
I didn't mean to be presumptuous, but last night after dinner,
I went back to my room, and I whipped up a little pâté for us.
Yes, of course.
I thought the croûte came out pretty well, don't you think?
- Yep.
- I mean, not bad for a little microwave in my room.
With some Génépi.
Because I know you're a man of expensive tastes,
I foraged for truffles this morning.
I rented a truffle-seeking pig and managed to dig this guy up.
That's pretty nice.
Perhaps you want to do the honors? The...
- Yeah.
- Wow, look at that knife work.
You should be a chef.
A nice cheese selection from this very farm.
- Yes, I guess.
- The process that we will be helping along today.
I'm excited about that as an experience.
I mean, everything is an experience today.
So is a colonoscopy, but...
So you ever milked a cow before?
I loved going to the farm when I was a kid.
- Yeah?
- They, like, they had 20 cows.
In the farming community in which you grew up, did kids at school ever brag about sort of...
I don't know how you describe this for a family audience...
But inappropriate contact with...
- No.
- With farm animals?
- No.
- Really? Never?
- No.
- So if I made, like, a grass smoothie and poured it on your crotch,
I think it would be pretty funny.
- It wouldn't.
- If no one was watching.
Yeah, no one is watching.
This scene is gone.
This scene doesn't exist.
Don't do that while
I'm milking you, man.
She's like...
Now, the milking thing, I...
I have some concerns.
I'm afraid.
- Are you?
- I'm a little afraid.
I... I think they sense that I, you know, my Jersey roots as opposed to, you know, your country ass, you know?
They know you; they recognize you as one of theirs.
Hello, Nadine. Huh?
You don't like Tony, huh?
Don't let him do it.
Kick him in the balls.
I give you $1,000 cash if you can get some milk out of this cow.
You'll give me a 1,000 bucks?
Okay, now we're talking, my friend.
Yeah.
Show me how it's done, farm boy.
- Oh, he's gonna show us.
- Okay.
Okay, I can do that.
You see how he does?
I think so. Okay.
- Okay?
- You first.
Okay.
Oh, there you go.
We should be playing, like, some '70s music, you know.
♪ Un-chicka-un-chicka-un
Okay, save some for me.
Come on, man, that's my $1,000 going in that pail.
- Okay, your turn.
- All right.
Watch how it's done.
Yeah. Jeez, I'm telling you.
- Go ahead.
- Okay. Oh, it's soft.
Hey, what's that called?
That's called $1,000, my friend.
Oh, that's strangely satisfying.
That's my grand.
I feel like a... a champion.
You don't want to do a goat, huh?
So to speak.
I mean, yes.
I think we learned something here today.
Yeah. Do it quickly.
Cheese. Don't get me wrong.
I love cheese. I adore it.
But it's day three of nonstop cheese, and we haven't even scratched the surface of the many wondrous specialties of the region.
Hotel Du Buet has been around for many years.
One comes here for the cheese.
In this case, the iconic raclette, and the equally iconic fondue.
Hello, can I have a drink with you?
Please.
Cheers.
Marianne Chanel and her siblings are the third generation of her family to run this place.
So this is a fa...
A family business?
- Yes.
- For how many years?
- Soon 130 years.
- 130 years?
So, in the family, the whole time?
Yes, it's my great granddad.
Great grandfather?
So, you're gonna have to help us.
I explain.
Finally, raclette.
I've been waiting for this.
I know.
Would you like it direct on your potatoes?
Please. Oh, it bubbles.
- Yeah.
- I cut with this part.
Oh, man, yeah. That's... whoa.
- Yeah, man, go for it.
- You wanna try?
No, no, go... go for it, big boy.
All right. Here we go.
Okay.
Uh... is there a future for him in the restaurant business?
I'm not so sure.
Normal humans do not usually follow multiple wads of oozing cheese melted over potatoes with a molten pot of more cheese.
So, you excited?
Finally, your fondue?
Yeah.
But we are no ordinary men.
We are Titans. We are Centurions of dairy products.
- See the fondue?
- Okay, let's do the fondue.
- Do some eights slowly.
- Figure eight.
Eight on the bottom.
You touch the bottom.
But not too... tong, tong, tong, like this.
Yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, man, that's good.
- That's what I said.
When you do that to the end of the fondue...
- Right.
- The fondue's perfect.
You know, you should know he bet me...
He bet me $1,000 today that I could not milk a cow.
- And you do?
- I did.
- Yeah.
- Victory.
Look, I know what to do with a cow.
I know what you do is, you gonna...
You put it in your fridge.
Exactly, right, right.
You are so sweet.
How can you do it?
Can I do what?
I mean, to be surrounded by so much of this great cheese.
Well, we ate about a pound of cheese each.
You're gonna have a big cannonball of crap lodged up your butt like a baby head.
The size of a freaking baby head.
You will understand the agony of delivery.
We are not leaving this table...
Well, we are, because there's a bunch of drunk, horny mountaineers coming in later.
Oh, we're gonna party with them, happily.
No, because I believe there might be yodeling involved.
- My God.
- I'm not worried about it.
I'll be fine.
Oh, whoa, whoa, watch this.
Okay, here goes the egg.
Oh, now we're getting serious.
- Can I try?
- Yup.
- Oh, man, that's good.
- It's different, huh?
- Totally.
- Oh, appreciate it.
- Holy Christ.
- What?
It's flat; we haven't started yet.
Why do people do this?
You do that to stay in shape, to enjoy nature.
- This is not a sport.
- Not a sport, man.
- This is a death sentence.
- We came from New York.
Look at the difference.
It's so peaceful.
You can go do this is Central Park.
Yeah, you can do that in Central Park.
- But, why would you?
- Ah, for fun.
This is for fun.
We're doing that for fun, Tony.
This is fun like chlamydia is fun.
We haven't even started to go up.
Okay, now, that's...
That's doing it exercise.
Oh, hell.
Every chef needs a mentor.
In the life and career of Eric Ripert, it was Maurice Guillot who filled that role, who took a young, fresh-faced cook from the mean streets of Antibes and turned him into the hardened professional he is today.
Breakfast.
Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
They said they'd cook lunch, which sounded like a sweet deal considering what's on the menu.
Ahh.
Cheers.
Start with heaping spoons full of the finest osetra caviar.
So, when you were from the east, on a scale of 1 to 10, how good are...
- Minus 2.
- Minus 2, and you only ended up in the kitchen because you were such a shit waiter, right?
Yeah, no, but I wanted to be in the kitchen.
After graduation,
I was in Paris with my suitcase.
I was 17 years old, and then I see that guy.
Maybe some asparagus, upon which one nestles a poached egg, a freshly frothed zabaione, and an obscenely generous pile of black truffle shavings.
I actually... I like a little zabaione.
Egg on egg, man.
Nothing beats it.
Ridiculous.
I don't know why people mistake me for you.
Because they see us on TV together.
We both have the white hair, and people can say,
"Oh, I love your restaurant; it's so good, Le Bernardin.
"Le Bernardin,
I love your restaurant.
It's great, the fish, it's wonderful."
You know what I always say?
No, I always say, you know,
"Can you believe all our fish is frozen."
No, he does.
He's not joking.
Steak au poivre with some fresh morel and new potatoes.
So what was 32 yolks again?
What was the... that's the recipe?
Yeah, for the hollandaise.
For his hollandaise.
32... 32 yolks.
Yeah, to make the hollandaise for him.
- No, it's an excellent book.
- Thank you, Tony.
My favorite part is when you're in prison in the south of France.
They force him to bite the heads off live chickens for the amusement of the other convicts.
- We did...
- That was a good scene, or was that "Midnight Express?"
I forget.
It was "Midnight Express."
How many years did you guys work together?
Actually, a long time.
From day one of my career, to when I left to America.
Very long time.
Why did you go to America and leave your ancestral home land?
Robichon sent me to America.
I wanted to go to Brazil, and then he looked at me and smiled and he said,
"Uh, I can't send you to Brazil.
You're not gonna cook anything there."
- Right.
- Actually, Robichon helped me to come to America.
He found me the job.
Yeah, what would you have been if you'd failed as a...
As an aspiring chef?
What was your fallback position?
I wanted to be a forest ranger.
- Forest ranger?
- Yeah.
Why? You like nature or something?
- Yeah.
- What was it, the uniform?
You like the uniform?
The shorts... they get shorts, and a little hat like Smokey the Bear.
But you're not an outdoorsman at all.
- What do you mean?
- You don't fish.
No, because I don't wanna catch fish.
We'll leave that where it is.
You've probably killed more fish over the telephone than...
A good fisherman.
They are dead already.
No, they kill them for you.
Don't say that.
You're like Scarface.
Don't say that or I give you a lot of salad.
Oh.
These mountains are majestic and beautiful.
You can walk them, take pictures of them.
You can ski down them.
They can also kill you.
So when shit gets bad, and you find yourself a tangle of busted bones and torn flesh, having slid off a lonely, high-altitude piece, it's people like Laurent
Langoisseur of La Compagnie du Mont-Blanc who come and save you.
Sonia Popoff works for Peloton de Gendarmerie de Haute Montagne.
She's who you call when things are really bad.
This was Eric's life dream as a young man, to be a...
- Yeah.
- A park ranger up in the Alps, or in the mountains; this is what he wanted to do as a...
- I wanted to be...
- As a young man.
- I wanted to be you.
- Let's face it.
Your career as a chef is coming to a... coming to an end.
You just turned 52.
Is it too late for him to start?
Oh, that's not a good sign.
I don't know how to say it.
It's, "Sorry, Pops."
I am in better shape than you to do it.
That's for sure.
Yeah.
- And I don't want to be mean.
- I'm not doing it.
So what's the most common injury?
So, a lot of knee and shoulders, dislocated shoulders.
- Head injuries.
- Concussion?
- Concussion.
- Yes.
I mean, I noticed, you know, there's a bar here.
I mean, do... how stupid do people get on the mountain?
You would be very surprised.
We see people not trained, not well-equipped, following, like, ski tracks to get them to crevasses, glaciers, cracks.
Right. So, if he drinks two bottles of Génépi, and he goes off piece...
And falls into a crevasse...
Ahh!
Dislocates his shoulder...
Augh!
Breaks his knee...
Ahh!
And...
- Why me?
- Has a concussion...
This is a hypothetical question.
Okay, okay.
So, okay, hypothermia is setting in.
Your ACL and your meniscus are both completely shredded,
And your all messed up from a concussion...
What is the thing I...
I should do?
Should I ski to the bottom and talk to someone?
- Yeah.
- Like, call my cell phone?
First I'd call the production company and tell them we need somebody else for the rest of the show.
He's such a nice guy.
To answer your question there, there is something today we use more and more on the people's cell phones.
Oh, find my phone.
- Find my corpse.
- Find my phone.
And just ask the people,
"Okay go back to your phone,
"and there's a GPS inside it, and it tells us exactly where to find you."
Avalanches happen here frequently.
Laurent and his rescue squads are here to prevent them before they occur if possible, and if not, to find you, and dig you out.
Allow us to demonstrate.
We bury our local contact,
Bullet, under the snow.
Search dogs, hopefully, will find him before he becomes a corpsicle and our production insurance becomes unsustainably expensive.
So, how common are avalanche?
Where are they most likely to... to happen?
Anywhere but the ski resorts.
Mostly the avalanches that kills people is not into a ski resort.
It's...
Outside.
Outside the boundaries.
Now, here's a question.
Ugh, great.
So, Eric's come back after he's recovered from his injuries, and he decides to go mountain climbing.
And he gets drunk again.
Something happened to me, you're gonna remember,
I'll tell you that.
And he climbs the mountain.
Ahh!
And he gets buried in this avalanche.
And he's buried in the snow.
What happens then?
Or, do you just say,
"Eh, see you in the summer."
Well, first you have to find the location, the whole location, and then we have a Tran signal locator like this one, as an example.
Something like this.
- Yes.
- And when you are caught in the avalanche...
They look for it.
The rest of teams keep a tool working with the same one, and then they can find a signal, and then they start digging.
How long can you live under the snow? If it's not...
You have three minutes.
Three minutes for...
Three minutes if you can press.
- Right.
- But sometimes, you have a little place for breathing.
- A little room?
- Yes, and you can survive a half an hour, one hour.
So I shouldn't give up too soon.
Yes.
So, why did you choose such a dangerous and difficult area of medicine?
I mean, you could have a nice practice in Paris, got, you know, people have headaches.
It's difficult to explain.
Yes, I know it's very dangerous, but, I think,
"I have to continue;
I have to stop."
I... I continue.
I'm not sure why I do it, but
I know it makes me alive, so... it's good.
But you like it.
- I do like it.
- Yeah, right?
You don't think about that.
You don't know why, but you do it.
Mm-hmm.
That's called compassion.
Le France, I love it, and God knows I love the cheese here, but a brief respite is needed from the torrent of dairy products.
Perhaps, I thought, the short hop across the border to Italy, would be a good idea.
I want pasta.
Maison Recettes has a long and storied history here in the Aosta Valley.
Our host Jean-Honore Cristie grew up in the region.
I love it here.
I'm so happy to be in Italy.
I... I feel a little treacherous, just denying my own roots, because I have zero Italian heritage as far as I know, zero, but I... I just love this lifestyle, this food; it's just great.
- Well, cheers.
- All right.
- Cheers.
- To... to Italy.
Slainte.
After you.
I will definitely have some of that.
This is even some homemade,
I like it.
Oh, interesting.
And this is a gift from me.
This is chamois that have... this year.
Uh-huh.
And I have done dried meat with the leg of the chomois.
Okay, more cheese, but it's a delicious order of gnocchi with beet moot fondue.
This is great.
We're doing prognil again?
We should have a camera in your colon.
Ravioli with tomato sauce.
Oh, man.
I know you were excited about it, right?
So you like pasta?
Oh, I love it.
He has been whining for a week.
A creamy polenta with braised beef.
- Okay.
- Oh, now, that's...
That's exciting.
Carbonada, one of the best you can find here in most of Italy.
- Which meat is this one?
- Beef.
- Beef?
- Yeah.
You remember our friend, the cow?
Yes, yesterday. She was cute.
Did you see the connection between her and I yesterday?
She was...
Yeah, she had her nose right in your crotch.
So, what is this game we're gonna play today?
Oh, it's called the feur lane.
- Feur lane?
- Feur lane.
This game is difficult to describe.
I gather the idea is, you try to hit that tiny polished stone with that stick as far as you can.
I do not think I can do that.
Oh, man.
Ohhhh...
I can't do that.
He wants us to hit it as far as he can.
Exactly. It's really simple.
This looks hard.
You have to lick the stone.
Did you see?
They lick the stone so it sticks to the big stone.
Ooh, this one is good.
Yeah.
Whew.
I'll tell you this, it's better than golf.
So, you don't love golf?
I hate golf.
- I wanna try.
- Okay.
I wanna try one, yeah,
I wanna do it one time.
So, I, I'll bet you $1,000...
- $1,000 you can't get it across the one.
I'm fine; I have nothing to lose.
- Well, yeah, $1,000.
- No.
Well, you're out, man.
No, three times.
Whoa.
Oh.
Oh, jeez.
No, it's like watching a monkey try to, like, work a typewriter.
Look, I don't even know why you would even...
Shh. Silent, please.
Oh, jeez.
Whoa!
Viva Italia!
Congratulations. No, no, man.
No, it was a miracle, and I'm proud of you.
Congratulations.
I think that's called a foul ball.
You have to think positive.
How lucky you are to be in the Alps...
On a beautiful day.
I'm lucky to not actively be throwing up on myself right now.
You know, you have to enjoy the little things in life, right?
I do.
I mean, this is a special moment.
I do.
I will enjoy the minute I don't have to do this anymore.
Oh, come on, man.
- So here's the plot.
- Yeah.
Okay, it's "64 Yolks: The
Revenge."
- It's about a chef...
- Yeah.
- Named Eric Ripert, who runs a three-star
Mishnah in New York, played by Bruce Willis, but what...
Oh, I'm played by, okay, I like that. Bruce Willis.
Okay, so Willis, playing you, goes out of the dining room, visiting the table, overhears a conversation.
- And then?
- Car chases, violence, big fight in the kitchen at Le Bernardin.
We could shoot it there; I'm sure it won't interrupt service.
Holy cow.
Oh.
It's unbelievable.
I mean, nothing is more beautiful than that.
Come in my selfie.
Oh, it's a video; hold on.
Look at him.
Yeah, yeah, you should do something like that.
- Oh, no, I don't like this.

Take 'em off; take 'em off.
Okay.

No, you gotta look... say...
Pretend I'm bleeding...

Dinner is served.
Dinner is served.
